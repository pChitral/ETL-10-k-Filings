All comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as noted. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for per share data, unless otherwise indicated.The results of our former Materials Technologies segment, which contained the Electronic Materials Division (EMD) and the Performance Materials Division (PMD), and the former Energy-from-Waste segment have been presented as discontinued operations. The results of operations and cash flows of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, financial information is presented on a continuing operations basis. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the discontinued businesses.Captions such as income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products, net income attributable to Air Products, and diluted earnings per share attributable to Air Products are simply referred to as “income from continuing operations,” “net income,” and “diluted earnings per share (EPS)” throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise stated.The discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to certain non-GAAP (""adjusted"") financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful supplemental information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. The reconciliations of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures are presented on pages 31-37. Descriptions of the excluded items appear on pages 24-26.19Table of ContentsBUSINESS OVERVIEWAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. is a world-leading Industrial Gases company in operation for over 75 years. The Company’s core industrial gases business provides atmospheric and process gases and related equipment to manufacturing markets, including refining and petrochemical, metals, electronics, and food and beverage. Air Products is also the world’s leading supplier of liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment. With operations in 50 countries, in 2017 we had sales of $8.2 billion, total company assets, including assets of both continuing and discontinued operations, of $18.5 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 15,300 full- and part-time employees from continuing and discontinued operations.As of 30 September 2017, our operations were organized into five reportable business segments: Industrial Gases – Americas; Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa); Industrial Gases – Asia; Industrial Gases – Global; and Corporate and other. The financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on these operations. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.2017 IN SUMMARYIn 2017, we were able to focus on our core industrial gases business by completing the separation of EMD through the spin-off of Versum Materials, Inc. (Versum) and the sale of PMD to Evonik Industries AG (Evonik). Sales of $8.2 billion increased nine percent over the prior year, primarily due to volume growth from new project onstreams across our regional industrial gases businesses, underlying growth in the base business, and continued progress on the Jazan project within our Industrial Gases – Global segment, partially offset by weaker liquefied natural gas (LNG) equipment sales. We delivered operating margin of 17.4%, adjusted operating margin of 21.6%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.1% as our productivity actions were offset by the impact of energy cost pass-through to customers. Diluted EPS of $5.16 increased 2% from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted diluted EPS of $6.31 increased 12%.Highlights for 2017 •Sales of $8,187.6 increased 9%, or $683.9 as underlying sales growth of 7% and higher energy and natural gas cost pass‑through to customers of 3% were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 1%. Underlying sales increased primarily from higher volumes across the industrial gases businesses, including the Jazan project, partially offset by lower LNG sales in the corporate and other segment.•Operating income of $1,427.6 decreased 7%, or $102.1, primarily due to a noncash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge and higher cost reduction and asset actions, partially offset by favorable volumes and lower other costs. Operating margin of 17.4% decreased 300 bp. On a non‑GAAP basis, adjusted operating income of $1,769.6 increased 9%, or $149.7, and adjusted operating margin of 21.6% was flat.•Adjusted EBITDA of $2,795.0 increased 7%, or $173.5. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.1% decreased 80 bp and was negatively impacted by 90 bp from higher contractual energy pass-through to customers. Excluding this impact, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 10 bp. •Income from continuing operations of $1,134.4 increased 3%, or $34.9, and diluted EPS of $5.16 increased 2%, or $.12. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted income from continuing operations of $1,385.9 increased 13%, or $155.6, and adjusted diluted EPS of $6.31 increased 12%, or $.67. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share, including a non‑GAAP reconciliation, is presented below.•We completed the spin-off of EMD as Versum on 1 October 2016.•We completed the sale of PMD to Evonik on 3 January 2017.•We entered into an agreement to form a $1.3 billion joint venture in China with Lu’An Clean Energy Company.•We increased our quarterly dividend by 10% from $.86 to $.95 per share. This represents the 35th consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment.20Table of ContentsChanges in Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to Air Products Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease)Diluted Earnings per Share Net income $13.65 $2.89 $10.76Income (Loss) from discontinued operations 8.49 (2.15) 10.64Income from Continuing Operations – GAAP Basis $5.16 $5.04 $.12Operating Income Impact (after-tax) Underlying business Volume $.29Price/raw materials .03Costs .24Currency (.03)Business separation costs .09Business restructuring and cost reduction actions (.38)Pension settlement loss (.01)Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge (.70)Gain on land sale .03Total Operating Income Impact (after-tax) $(.44)Other Impact (after-tax) Equity affiliates' income .04Equity method investment impairment charge (.36)Interest expense (.02)Other non-operating income (expense), net .10Loss on extinguishment of debt .02Income tax .07Tax costs associated with business separation .26Tax election benefit .50Noncontrolling interests (.01)Weighted average diluted shares (.04)Total Other Impact (after-tax) $.56Total Change in Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations – GAAP Basis $.12 Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease)Income from Continuing Operations – GAAP Basis $5.16 $5.04 $.12Business separation costs .12 .21 (.09)Tax (benefit) costs associated with business separation (.02) .24 (.26)Business restructuring and cost reduction actions .49 .11 .38Pension settlement loss .03 .02 .01Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge .70 — .70Gain on land sale (.03) — (.03)Equity method investment impairment charge .36 — .36Loss on extinguishment of debt — .02 (.02)Tax election benefit (.50) — (.50)Income from Continuing Operations – Non-GAAP Basis $6.31 $5.64 $.6721Table of Contents2018 OUTLOOKIn 2018, we intend to build on our strong fiscal year 2017 operating results through a combination of base business growth, new project onstreams, and productivity benefits. We expect lower income from transition services agreements to be offset by cost reductions associated with these services. Our recent portfolio actions, including the spin-off of Versum and the sale PMD, and improved operating results have positioned us with a strong balance sheet and the opportunity to invest in our core industrial gases business to drive future growth and create shareholder value. The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.”RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDiscussion of Consolidated Results 201720162015Sales$8,187.6$7,503.7$7,824.3Operating income1,427.61,529.71,233.2Operating margin17.4%20.4%15.8%Equity affiliates’ income80.1147.0152.3Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted EBITDA$2,795.0$2,621.5$2,399.4Adjusted EBITDA margin34.1%34.9%30.7%Adjusted operating income1,769.61,619.91,388.6Adjusted operating margin21.6%21.6%17.7%Adjusted equity affiliates' income159.6147.0152.3Sales % Change from Prior Year 20172016Underlying business Volume6 %3 %Price1 %— %Energy and raw material cost pass-through3 %(4)%Currency(1)%(3)%Total Consolidated Change9 %(4)%2017 vs. 2016 Sales of $8,187.6 increased 9%, or $683.9. Underlying sales increased 7% from higher volumes of 6% and higher pricing of 1%. Higher volumes, primarily due to new project onstreams, underlying base business growth across the Industrial Gases regions, and continued progress on the Jazan project within our Industrial Gases – Global segment, were partially offset by lower LNG project activity in the Corporate and other segment. The pricing improvement was primarily attributable to the Industrial Gases – Asia segment. Higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 3%, and unfavorable currency effects reduced sales by 1%.2016 vs. 2015 Sales of $7,503.7 decreased 4.0%, or $320.6. Underlying sales increased 3%, primarily due to higher volumes in the Industrial Gases – Global and Industrial Gases – Asia segments, partially offset by lower volumes in all other segments. Price was flat as increases in the Industrial Gases – Americas and Industrial Gases – EMEA segments were offset by lower prices in the Industrial Gases – Asia segment. Underlying sales growth was more than offset by lower energy contractual cost pass-through to customers of 4% and unfavorable currency of 3%.22Table of ContentsOperating Income and Margin2017 vs. 2016Operating income of $1,427.6 decreased 7%, or $102.1, as a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $162, higher cost reduction and asset actions of $117, unfavorable currency impacts of $9, and higher pension settlement losses of $5 were partially offset by favorable volumes of $83, favorable net operating costs of $69, lower business separation costs of $20, a gain on the sale of land of $12, and favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs, of $7. Net operating costs were lower primarily due to benefits from cost reduction actions and higher other income. Operating margin of 17.4% decreased 300 bp, primarily due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge and higher cost reduction and asset actions.On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating income of $1,769.6 increased 9%, or $149.7, primarily due to higher volumes and favorable cost performance. Adjusted operating margin of 21.6% was flat as higher energy and natural gas pass-through to customers was offset by lower costs.2016 vs. 2015 Operating income of $1,529.7 increased 24%, or $296.5, as lower operating costs of $235, lower business restructuring and cost reduction actions of $146, favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs, of $33, and lower pension settlement losses of $14 were partially offset by higher business separation costs of $43, unfavorable currency impacts of $35, and lower volumes of $2. In addition, fiscal year 2015 included a gain on land sales of $34 and a gain of $18 on a previously held equity interest. Operating costs decreased due to benefits from our cost reduction actions of $115, lower pension expense of $33, lower maintenance expense of $37, and lower other costs of $50.Operating margin of 20.4% increased 460 bp, primarily due to favorable costs and favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating income of $1,619.9 increased 17%, or $231.3, and adjusted operating margin of 21.6% increased 390 bp.Adjusted EBITDAWe define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non‑operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance. 2017 vs. 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,795.0 increased $173.5, or 7%, primarily due to higher volumes and favorable cost performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.1% decreased 80 bp, primarily due to a 90 bp impact from higher energy pass-through to customers.2016 vs. 2015 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,621.5 increased $222.1, or 9%, primarily due to favorable costs and favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.9% increased 420 bp.Equity Affiliates’ Income2017 vs. 2016 Income from equity affiliates of $80.1 decreased $66.9, primarily due to a noncash impairment charge of $79.5 ($.36 per share) on our investment in Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co., Ltd. (AHG), a 25%‑owned equity affiliate in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment. This charge has been excluded from segment results. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted equity affiliates' income of $159.6 increased 9%, or $12.6. Refer to Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge.2016 vs. 2015 Income from equity affiliates of $147.0 decreased $5.3, as lower income from Industrial Gases – Americas and Industrial Gases – EMEA affiliates was partially offset by higher income from Industrial Gases – Asia affiliates.23Table of ContentsCost of Sales and Gross Margin2017 vs. 2016 Cost of sales of $5,753.4 increased $576.8, or 11%, due to higher costs attributable to sales volumes of $418, higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of $218, and higher other costs of $24, partially offset by favorable currency impacts of $83.Gross margin of 29.7% decreased 130 bp, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers and unfavorable volume mix.2016 vs. 2015 Cost of sales of $5,176.6 decreased $421.6, or 8%, primarily due to lower energy costs of $271, a favorable currency impact of $192, and lower operating costs of $148, partially offset by higher costs attributable to sales volumes of $189. Operating costs included favorable impacts from cost reduction actions of $48, lower maintenance costs of $37, lower pension expense of $21, as well as the benefits of other operational improvements and productivity. Costs associated with volumes were higher primarily due to the Jazan sale of equipment activity.Gross margin of 31.0% increased 250 bp, primarily due to lower costs.Selling and Administrative Expense2017 vs. 2016 Selling and administrative expense of $715.6 increased $30.6, or 4%, primarily due to costs in support of transition services agreements with Versum and Evonik, for which the reimbursement is reflected in ""Other income (expense), net."" Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 8.7% from 9.1%.2016 vs. 2015 Selling and administrative expense of $685.0 decreased $88.0, or 11%, primarily due to the benefits of cost reduction actions of $59 and favorable currency effects of $27. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 9.1% from 9.9%.Research and Development2017 vs. 2016 Research and development expense of $57.8 decreased $13.8, or 19%. Research and development expense as a percent of sales decreased to .7% from 1.0%.2016 vs. 2015 Research and development expense of $71.6 decreased $4.8, or 6%. Fiscal year 2016 and 2015 research and development expense as a percent of sales was 1.0%.Business Separation CostsIn connection with the disposition of EMD and PMD, we incurred separation costs of $30.2 ($26.5 after-tax, or $.12 per share), $50.6 ($46.7 after-tax, or $.21 per share), and $7.5 ($.03 per share) in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. These costs are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Business separation costs” and include legal, advisory, and pension related costs.Our fiscal year 2017 income tax provision includes net tax benefits of $5.5 ($.02 per share) primarily related to changes in tax positions on business separation activities. Our fiscal year 2016 income tax provision includes additional tax expense related to the separation of $51.8 ($.24 per share), of which $45.7 resulted from a dividend that was declared in June 2016 to repatriate $443.8 from a subsidiary in South Korea to the U.S. in anticipation of the separation of EMD from the industrial gases business in South Korea.Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the dispositions.24Table of ContentsBusiness Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions We recorded charges in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015 for business restructuring and cost reduction actions. The charges for these actions are excluded from segment operating income. Refer to Note 5, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions.Cost Reduction ActionsIn fiscal year 2017, we recognized a net expense of $151.4 ($109.3 attributable to Air Products, after-tax, or $.49 per share), of which $154.8 related to actions taken during the current year, partially offset by the favorable settlement of the remaining $3.4 accrued balance associated with prior business restructuring actions. Asset actions totaled $88.5 and included charges resulting from the write‑down of an air separation unit in the Industrial Gases – EMEA segment that was constructed mainly to provide oxygen to one of the Energy‑from‑Waste plants, the planned sale of a non-industrial gas hardgoods business in the Industrial Gases – Americas segment, and the closure of a facility in the Corporate and other segment that manufactured LNG heat exchangers. Severance and other benefits totaled $66.3 and related to the elimination or planned elimination of approximately 625 positions, primarily in the Corporate and other segment and in the Industrial Gases – EMEA segment. The actions in the Corporate and other segment were driven by the reorganization of our engineering, manufacturing, and technology functions.In fiscal year 2016, we recognized an expense of $34.5 ($24.7 after-tax, or $.11 per share) for severance and other benefits related to cost reduction actions which resulted in the elimination of approximately 610 positions. The expenses related primarily to the Industrial Gases – Americas segment and the Industrial Gases – EMEA segment.Business Realignment and ReorganizationIn fiscal year 2015, we recognized an expense of $180.1 ($132.9 after-tax, or $.61 per share). Severance and other benefits totaled $131.5 and related to the elimination of approximately 1,700 positions. Asset and associated contract actions totaled $48.6 and related primarily to a plant shutdown in the Corporate and other segment and the exit of a product line within the Industrial Gases – Global segment. Pension Settlement LossCertain of our pension plans provide for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after their retirement date. A participant's vested benefit is considered settled upon cash payment of the lump sum. We recognize pension settlement losses when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of the plan for the fiscal year. We recognized pension settlement losses of $10.5 ($6.6 after-tax, or $.03 per share), $5.1 ($3.3 after-tax, or $.02 per share), and $19.3 ($12.4 after-tax, or $.06 per share) in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, to accelerate recognition of a portion of actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, primarily associated with the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan.Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment ChargeDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily acquired trade names) associated with our Latin America reporting unit of our Industrial Gases – Americas segment were impaired. We recorded a noncash impairment charge of $162.1 ($154.1 attributable to Air Products, after-tax, or $.70 per share), which was driven by lower economic growth and profitability in the region. Refer to Note 10, Goodwill, and Note 11, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.25Table of ContentsGain on Previously Held Equity InterestOn 30 December 2014, we acquired our partner’s equity ownership interest in a liquefied atmospheric industrial gases production joint venture in North America for $22.6, which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and subsequent to the acquisition, the results were consolidated within our Industrial Gases – Americas segment. We recorded a gain of $17.9 ($11.2 after-tax, or $.05 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 6, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.Other Income (Expense), NetItems recorded to other income (expense), net arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income (expense), net is presented in Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements.2017 vs. 2016 Other income (expense), net of $121.0 increased $71.6, primarily due to income from transition services agreements with Versum and Evonik, income from the sale of assets and investments, including a gain of $12.2 ($7.6 after-tax, or $.03 per share) resulting from the sale of a parcel of land, and a favorable foreign exchange impact.2016 vs. 2015 Other income (expense), net of $49.4 increased $3.9, primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses, favorable contract settlements, and receipt of a government subsidy. Fiscal year 2015 included a gain of $33.6 ($28.3 after‑tax, or $.13 per share) resulting from the sale of two parcels of land. No other individual items were significant in comparison to fiscal year 2015.Interest Expense 201720162015Interest incurred$139.6$147.9$151.9Less: Capitalized interest19.032.749.1Interest Expense$120.6$115.2$102.82017 vs. 2016 Interest incurred decreased $8.3 as the impact from a lower average debt balance of $26 was partially offset by the impact from a higher average interest rate on the debt portfolio of $19. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in the carrying value of projects under construction, primarily as a result of our decision to exit from the Energy-from-Waste business.2016 vs. 2015 Interest incurred decreased $4.0. The decrease primarily resulted from a stronger U.S. dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest of $6, partially offset by a higher average debt balance of $2. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in the carrying value of projects under construction, primarily as a result of our exit from the Energy-from-Waste business.Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), NetOther non-operating income (expense), net of $29.0 in fiscal year 2017 primarily resulted from interest income on cash and time deposits, which are comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of PMD. Interest income was included in ""Other income (expense), net"" in 2016 and 2015. Interest income in previous periods was not material.Loss on Extinguishment of DebtOn 30 September 2016, in anticipation of the spin-off of EMD, Versum issued $425.0 of notes to Air Products, who then exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for $418.3 of Air Products’ outstanding commercial paper. This noncash exchange, which was excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows, resulted in a loss of $6.9 ($4.3 after-tax, or $.02 per share).In September 2015, we made a payment of $146.6 to redeem 3,000,000 Unidades de Fomento (“UF”) Series E 6.30% Bonds due 22 January 2030 that had a carrying value of $130.0 and resulted in a net loss of $16.6 ($14.2 after-tax, or $.07 per share).26Table of ContentsEffective Tax RateThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate.2017 vs. 2016 The effective tax rate was 18.4% and 27.8% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The current year rate included an impact of approximately 700 bp from a net income tax benefit resulting from a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary and an impact of approximately 100 bp from excess tax benefits on share-based compensation resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. These impacts were partially offset by an increase of approximately 200 bp due to both a goodwill impairment charge in our Latin America reporting unit and an impairment of an equity method investment for which no tax benefits were available. The 2016 rate included a 330 bp impact from tax costs associated with business separation, primarily resulting from a dividend declared in 2016 to repatriate cash from a foreign subsidiary as discussed above under Business Separation Costs. The remaining change was primarily due to the impact of business separation costs for which a tax benefit was estimated to not be available. On a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted effective tax rate decreased from 24.2% in 2016 to 23.2% in 2017, primarily due to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. Refer to Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our adoption of the share-based compensation accounting guidance.2016 vs. 2015 The effective tax rate was 27.8% and 23.7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change included a 330 bp impact from tax costs associated with business separation, primarily resulting from a dividend declared in 2016 to repatriate cash from a foreign subsidiary as discussed above under Business Separation Costs. The remaining 80 bp change was primarily due to the increase in mix of income in jurisdictions with a higher effective tax rate and the impact of business separation costs for which a tax benefit was estimated to not be available. On a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted effective tax rate increased from 24.0% in 2015 to 24.2% in 2016, primarily due to the increase in and mix of income in jurisdictions with a higher effective tax rate.Discontinued OperationsThe results of our former Materials Technologies segment and the former Energy-from-Waste segment have been presented as discontinued operations. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information, including detail of the major line items that comprise income from discontinued operations, net of tax, on the consolidated income statements for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2017, 2016, and 2015.Materials Technologies On 16 September 2015, we announced plans to separate our Materials Technologies segment, which contained EMD and PMD. On 1 October 2016, we completed the separation of EMD through the spin-off of Versum. On 3 January 2017, we completed the sale of PMD to Evonik for $3.8 billion in cash. A gain of $2,870 ($1,828 after-tax, or $8.32 per share) was recognized on the sale. As a result of the dispositions, both EMD and PMD are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.Energy-from-WasteOn 29 March 2016, the Board of Directors approved the Company’s exit of its Energy‑from‑Waste (EfW) business and efforts to start up and operate the two EfW projects located in Tees Valley, United Kingdom, were discontinued. Since that time, the EfW segment has been presented as a discontinued operation. Our fiscal year 2016 loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, includes a loss on disposal of $945.7 ($846.6 after-tax) recorded to write down plant assets to their estimated net realizable value and record a liability for plant disposition and other costs.During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we determined that it is unlikely for a buyer to assume the remaining assets and contract obligations, including land lease obligations. As a result, we recorded an additional loss of $59.3 ($47.1 after-tax) in results of discontinued operations, of which $53.0 was recorded primarily for land lease obligations and $6.3 was recorded to update our estimate of the net realizable value of the plant assets as of 31 December 2016. There have been no changes to our estimates during the remainder of fiscal year 2017. We may incur additional exit costs in future periods related to other outstanding commitments.27Table of ContentsSegment AnalysisIndustrial Gases – Americas 201720162015Sales$3,637.0$3,344.1$3,694.5Operating income950.6893.2806.1Operating margin26.1%26.7%21.8%Equity affiliates’ income58.152.764.6Adjusted EBITDA1,473.11,389.51,288.2Adjusted EBITDA margin40.5%41.6%34.9%Industrial Gases – Americas Sales % Change from Prior Year 20172016Underlying business Volume2%(2)%Price—%1 %Energy and raw material cost pass-through6%(6)%Currency1%(2)%Total Industrial Gases – Americas Change9%(9)%2017 vs. 2016 Underlying sales were up 2% from stronger hydrogen volumes and a new hydrogen plant in Canada. Higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 6%. Favorable currency effects, primarily from the Chilean Peso, increased sales by 1%. Operating income of $950.6 increased 6%, or $57.4, primarily due to lower operating costs of $37 and higher volumes of $18. Operating costs were lower due to benefits from productivity improvements. Operating margin decreased 60 bp from the prior year primarily due to higher energy and natural gas pass-through to customers, partially offset by favorable cost performance.Equity affiliates’ income of $58.1 increased $5.4, primarily due to lower maintenance expense and a new plant onstream.2016 vs. 2015 Underlying sales decreased 1% from lower volumes of 2%, partially offset by higher pricing of 1%. Volumes were down due to weakness in Latin America and lower steel demand in North America. Pricing was higher due to the benefit of pricing actions, mainly the recovery of inflationary and power cost increases in Latin America. Lower energy contractual cost pass-through to customers, primarily natural gas, decreased sales by 6%. Currency decreased sales by 2% primarily due to the impacts of the Chilean Peso, Brazilian Real, and Canadian Dollar.Operating income of $893.2 increased 11%, or $87.1, due to lower operating costs of $108 and higher pricing, net of energy and fuel costs, of $26, partially offset by lower volumes of $33 and unfavorable currency impacts of $14. Operating costs were lower due to benefits from cost reduction actions. Operating margin increased 490 bp from fiscal year 2015, primarily due to the lower costs, with additional benefits from lower energy pass-through and higher pricing.Equity affiliates’ income of $52.7 decreased $11.9, primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and higher maintenance expense.28Table of ContentsIndustrial Gases – EMEA 201720162015Sales$1,780.4$1,704.4$1,866.4Operating income387.1384.6331.3Operating margin21.7%22.6%17.8%Equity affiliates’ income47.136.542.4Adjusted EBITDA611.3606.8568.0Adjusted EBITDA margin34.3%35.6%30.4%Industrial Gases – EMEA Sales % Change from Prior Year 20172016Underlying business Volume6 %(2)%Price— %1 %Energy and raw material cost pass-through1 %(4)%Currency(3)%(4)%Total Industrial Gases – EMEA Change4 %(9)%2017 vs. 2016 Underlying sales were up 6% from higher volumes as pricing was flat.

Unfavorable currency effects, primarily from the British Pound Sterling, reduced sales by 3%. Operating income of $387.1 increased 1%, or $2.5, primarily due to lower operating costs of $21 and higher volumes, including a new plant onstream, of $15, partially offset by lower price net of power costs of $18 and unfavorable currency impacts of $15. Operating costs were lower primarily due to benefits from operational improvements. Operating margin decreased 90 bp from the prior year, as lower price net of power costs, higher energy and natural gas pass-through to customers, and unfavorable currency impacts were partially offset by favorable cost performance.Equity affiliates’ income of $47.1 increased $10.6, primarily due to higher volumes.2016 vs. 2015 Underlying sales decreased 1% as lower volumes of 2% were partially offset by higher pricing of 1%. Volumes decreased primarily due to continued weakness in the European economy. Lower energy and natural gas contractual cost pass-through to customers decreased sales by 4%. Unfavorable currency effects from the Euro and the British Pound Sterling reduced sales by 4%. Other than the impact on currency, the Brexit vote in June of 2016 did not have a notable impact on our business.Operating income of $384.6 increased 16%, or $53.3, primarily due to favorable operating costs of $60 and higher pricing, net of energy and fuel costs, of $20, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of $18 and lower volumes of $9.

The increase in sales was primarily driven by a sale of equipment contract for multiple air separation units that will serve Saudi Aramco’s Jazan oil refinery and power plant in Saudi Arabia. In 2017, we recognized approximately $540 of sales related to the Jazan project. Operating income of $71.3 increased $92.6 from an operating loss in the prior year, primarily from income on the Jazan project and productivity improvements.30Table of Contents2016 vs. 2015 Sales of $498.8 increased $212.1, or 74%. The increase in sales was driven by the Jazan project which more than offset the decrease in small equipment and other air separation unit sales. In 2016, we recognized approximately $300 of sales related to the Jazan project.Operating loss of $21.3 decreased 59%, or $30.3, primarily from income on the Jazan project and benefits from cost reduction actions, partially offset by lower other sale of equipment project activity and a gain associated with the cancellation of a sale of equipment contract that was recorded in fiscal year 2015.Corporate and otherThe Corporate and other segment includes two ongoing global businesses (our LNG equipment business and our liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage container businesses), and corporate support functions that benefit all the segments. Corporate and other also includes income and expense that is not directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses and stranded costs. Stranded costs result from functional support previously provided to the two divisions comprising the former Materials Technologies segment. The majority of these costs are reimbursed to Air Products pursuant to short-term transition services agreements under which Air Products provides transition services to Versum for EMD and to Evonik for PMD. The reimbursement for costs in support of the transition services has been reflected on the consolidated income statements within ""Other income (expense), net."" 201720162015Sales$82.6$236.0$315.4Operating loss(170.6)(87.6)(86.5)Adjusted EBITDA(158.4)(68.1)(66.2)2017 vs. 2016 Sales of $82.6 decreased $153.4, primarily due to lower LNG project activity. We expect continued weakness in new LNG project orders due to continued oversupply of LNG in the market. Operating loss of $170.6 increased $83.0 due to lower LNG activity, partially offset by productivity improvements and income from transition service agreements with Versum and Evonik.2016 vs. 2015 Sales of $236.0 decreased $79.4, or 25%, primarily due to lower LNG sale of equipment activity. Operating loss of $87.6 increased 1%, or $1.1, due to lower LNG activity, mostly offset by benefits from our recent cost reduction actions and lower foreign exchange losses.RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data)The Company has presented certain financial measures on a non-GAAP (“adjusted”) basis and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful supplemental information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. In many cases, our non-GAAP measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to exclude certain disclosed items (“non-GAAP adjustments”) that we believe are not representative of the underlying business performance. For example, Air Products has executed its strategic plan to restructure the Company to focus on its core Industrial Gases business. This resulted in significant cost reduction and asset actions that we believe are important for investors to understand separately from the performance of the underlying business. The reader should be aware that we may incur similar expenses in the future. The tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions. Investors should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. 31Table of ContentsPresented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures:CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Continuing Operations OperatingIncomeOperatingMargin(A)Equity Affiliates' IncomeIncome TaxProvision(B)NetIncomeDilutedEPS2017 GAAP$1,427.617.4 %$80.1$260.9$1,134.4$5.162016 GAAP1,529.720.4 %147.0432.61,099.55.04Change GAAP$(102.1)(300)bp$(66.9)$(171.7)$34.9$.12% Change GAAP(7)% (46)%(40)%3%2%2017 GAAP$1,427.617.4 %$80.1$260.9$1,134.4$5.16Business separation costs(C)30.2.4 %—3.726.5.12Tax benefit associated with business separation(C)—— %—5.5(5.5)(.02)Business restructuring and cost reduction actions(D)151.41.8 %—41.6109.3.49Pension settlement loss10.5.1 %—3.96.6.03Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge(E)162.12.0 %—4.6154.1.70Gain on land sale(F)(12.2)(.1)%—(4.6)(7.6)(.03)Equity method investment impairment charge—— %79.5—79.5.36Tax election benefit—— %—111.4(111.4)(.50)2017 Non-GAAP Measure$1,769.621.6 %$159.6$427.0$1,385.9$6.312016 GAAP$1,529.720.4 %$147.0$432.6$1,099.5$5.04Business separation costs(C)50.6.7 %—3.946.7.21Tax costs associated with business separation(C)—— %—(51.8)51.8.24Business restructuring and cost reduction actions34.5.4 %—9.824.7.11Pension settlement loss5.1.1 %—1.83.3.02Loss on extinguishment of debt(G)—— %—2.64.3.022016 Non-GAAP Measure$1,619.921.6 %$147.0$398.9$1,230.3$5.64Change Non-GAAP Measure$149.7—$12.6$28.1$155.6$.67% Change Non-GAAP Measure9 % 9 %7 %13%12%32Table of Contents Continuing Operations OperatingIncomeOperatingMargin(A)Equity Affiliates' IncomeIncome TaxProvision(B)NetIncomeDilutedEPS2016 GAAP$1,529.720.4 %$147.0$432.6$1,099.5$5.042015 GAAP1,233.215.8 %152.3300.2933.34.29Change GAAP$296.5460bp$(5.3)$132.4$166.2$.75% Change GAAP24% (3)%44%18%17%2016 GAAP$1,529.720.4 %$147.0$432.6$1,099.5$5.04Business separation costs(C)50.6.7 %—3.946.7.21Tax costs associated with business separation(C)—— %—(51.8)51.8.24Business restructuring and cost reduction actions34.5.4 %—9.824.7.11Pension settlement loss5.1.1 %—1.83.3.02Loss on extinguishment of debt(G)—— %—2.64.3.022016 Non-GAAP Measure$1,619.921.6 %$147.0$398.9$1,230.3$5.642015 GAAP$1,233.215.8 %$152.3$300.2$933.3$4.29Business separation costs(C)7.5.1 %——7.5.03Business restructuring and cost reduction actions180.12.3 %—47.2132.9.61Pension settlement loss19.3.2 %—6.912.4.06Gain on previously held equity interest(17.9)(.3)%—(6.7)(11.2)(.05)Gain on land sales(F)(33.6)(.4)%—(5.3)(28.3)(.13)Loss on extinguishment of debt(G)—— %—2.414.2.072015 Non-GAAP Measure$1,388.617.7 %$152.3$344.7$1,060.8$4.88Change Non-GAAP Measure$231.3390bp$(5.3)$54.2$169.5$.76% Change Non-GAAP Measure17% (3)%16%16%16%(A) Operating margin is calculated by dividing operating income by sales.(B) The tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.(C) Refer to Note 4, Materials Technologies Separation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.(D) Noncontrolling interests impact of $.5 in fiscal year 2017.(E) Noncontrolling interests impact of $3.4 in fiscal year 2017.(F) Reflected on the consolidated income statements in “Other income (expense), net.”(G) Income from continuing operations before taxes impact of $6.9 and $16.6 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.33Table of ContentsADJUSTED EBITDAWe define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense.

The cash and cash items balance is higher than our historical trend and primarily results from the sale of PMD to Evonik on 3 January 2017. We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operating and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.As of 30 September 2017, we had $1,530.2 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $3,273.6. If the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the U.S. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the U.S. Current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds.37Table of ContentsOur cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:Cash provided by (used for) 2017 2016 2015Operating activities $2,534.1 $2,258.8 $2,047.0Investing activities (1,417.7) (864.8) (1,146.7)Financing activities (2,040.9) (860.2) (960.4)Operating ActivitiesFor the year ended 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $2,534.1. Income from continuing operations of $1,134.4 included a goodwill and intangible impairment charge of $162.1, an equity method investment impairment charge of $79.5, and a write-down of long-lived assets associated with restructuring of $69.2. Refer to Note 5, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions; Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates; Note 10, Goodwill; and Note 11, Intangible Assets, of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these charges. Other specifically identified adjustments to income from continuing operations include depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation, noncurrent capital lease receivables, and undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Other adjustments of $165.4 included changes in uncertain tax positions and the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that hedge intercompany loans as well as pension contributions and expense. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $48.0 that were primarily driven by payables and accrued liabilities and other receivables, partially offset by other working capital and trade receivables. The increase in payables and accrued liabilities of $163.8 was primarily due to timing differences related to payables and accrued liabilities and an increase in customer advances of $52.8 primarily related to sale of equipment activity. The source of cash from other receivables of $124.7 was primarily due to the maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures. Other working capital was a use of cash of $154.0, primarily driven by payments for income taxes. Trade receivables was a use of cash of $73.6 which is primarily due to timing differences.For the year ended 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $2,258.8. Income from continuing operations of $1,099.5 included a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.9. Other adjustments of $156.7 were primarily driven by the remeasurement of intercompany transactions as the related hedging instruments that eliminate the earnings impact are included in other receivables and payables and accrued liabilities. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $21.2 that were primarily driven by payables and accrued liabilities and inventory partially offset by trade receivables and other working capital. The increase in payables and accrued liabilities of $60.1 was primarily related to an increase in customer advances which includes payment from our joint venture in Jazan, Saudi Arabia and was partially offset by the changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that hedge intercompany loans. The use of cash from other working capital of $47.8 was primarily driven by advances associated with the purchase of helium partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes, including the impacts of higher income. For the year ended 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $2,047.0. Income from continuing operations of $933.3 included the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $40.2, a noncash gain on the previously held equity interest of $17.9, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.6. Other adjustments included pension and postretirement expense of $120.1 and contributions to our pension plans of $137.5, primarily for plans in the U.S. and U.K. Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including tax, cash flow, and regulatory implications. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $256.0. The increase of payables and accrued liabilities of $134.9 includes an increase in accrued incentive compensation of $72.7.Investing ActivitiesFor the year ended 30 September 2017, cash used for investing activities was $1,417.7. Capital expenditures for plant and equipment was $1,039.7. Purchases of investments of $2,692.6 include short-term instruments with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year. Proceeds from investments of $2,290.7 resulted from maturities of short-term instruments with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year.For the year ended 30 September 2016, cash used for investing activities was $864.8, driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment of $907.7. Proceeds from the sale of assets and investments of $44.6 was primarily driven by the receipt of $30.0 for our rights to a corporate aircraft that was under construction. 38Table of ContentsFor the year ended 30 September 2015, cash used for investing activities was $1,146.7, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment. On 30 December 2014, we acquired our partner’s equity ownership interest in a liquefied atmospheric industrial gases production joint venture in North America which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. Refer to Note 6, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 201720162015Additions to plant and equipment$1,039.7$907.7$1,162.4Acquisitions, less cash acquired8.2—34.5Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates8.1—4.3Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis$1,056.0$907.7$1,201.2Capital lease expenditures(A)9.927.295.6Purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary(A)——278.4Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis$1,065.9$934.9$1,575.2(A) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows within ""Cash Provided by Operating Activities"" if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests is accounted for as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2017 totaled $1,056.0, compared to $907.7 in 2016. The increase of $148.3 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures on facility improvement projects and major project spending. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Spending in 2017 and 2016 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen and nitrogen for coal to liquid fuel in China, hydrogen to global markets, oxygen to the steel industry, and nitrogen for the electronics industry. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2017 totaled $1,065.9 compared to $934.9 in 2016. The increase of $131.0 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures on facility improvement projects and major project spending partially offset by lower capital lease expenditures.On 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded noncash transactions which resulted in an increase of $26.9 and $67.5, respectively, to our investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates for our obligation to invest in the joint venture. These noncash transactions were excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows and there was no impact in 2017. In total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. Air Products has also entered into a sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer, procure, and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply the gases to Saudi Aramco.Sales backlog represents our estimate of revenue to be recognized in the future on our share of Air Products’ sale of equipment orders and related process technology that are under firm contracts. The sales backlog for the Company at 30 September 2017 was $481 compared to $1,057 at 30 September 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by progress on the Jazan project. 39Table of Contents2018 OutlookCapital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2018 are expected to be approximately $1,000 to $1,200. This range excludes possible acquisitions and our previously announced agreement to form a joint venture, Air Products Lu’an (Changzhi) Co., Ltd., with Lu’An Clean Energy Company that will build, own and operate four large air separation units as discussed in the Contractual Obligations section on page 43. A majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants that are currently under construction or expected to start construction. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisitions of small and medium size industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; the purchase of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and investment in very large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.Financing ActivitiesFor the year ended 2017, cash used for financing activities was $2,040.9. This consisted primarily of repayments of commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $798.6, dividend payments to shareholders of $787.9 and payments on long-term debt of $483.9. Payments on long-term debt primarily consisted of the repayment of a 4.625% Eurobond of €300 million ($317.2) that matured on 15 March 2017 and $138.0 for the repayment of industrial revenue bonds. For the year ended 2016, cash used for financing activities was $860.2. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net use of cash of $237.7 and included the repayment of the 2.0% Senior Note of $350.0 million on 2 August 2016, and a $144.2 use of cash for net commercial paper and other short-term debt borrowings which were partially offset by debt proceeds from the issuance of a .375% Eurobond of €350 million ($386.9) on 1 June 2016. Versum distributed in-kind notes with an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 to Air Products. However, since Air Products exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for $418.3 of Air Products’ outstanding commercial paper, this noncash debt for debt exchange was excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note 4, Materials Technologies Separation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We also used cash to pay dividends of $721.2 and received proceeds from stock option exercises of $141.3. For the year ended 2015, cash used for financing activities was $960.4 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $677.5 and payments for subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interest of $278.4, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $121.3. Our borrowings were a net use of cash of $73.9 and included $285.2 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances, debt proceeds from the issuance of a 1.0% Eurobond of €300 million ($335.3), repayment of a 3.875% Eurobond of €300 million ($335.9), repayment of Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling $147.2, and repayment of 3,000,000 Unidades de Fomento (“UF”) Series E 6.30% Bonds totaling $146.6. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.Discontinued OperationsFor the year ended 2017, cash flows of discontinued operations primarily included impacts associated with the spin-off of EMD as Versum on 1 October 2016 and the sale of PMD to Evonik on 3 January 2017. Cash used for operating activities of $966.2 was primarily driven by taxes paid on the gain on the sale of PMD. Cash provided by investing activities of $3,750.6 primarily resulted from the proceeds on the sale of PMD. Cash provided by financing activities resulted from a $69.5 receipt of cash from Versum related to finalization of the spin-off. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.For the year ended 2016, discontinued operations primarily includes the Energy-from-Waste business, which the Company decided to exit in the second quarter of 2016, and the Materials Technologies business which contained two divisions, EMD and PMD. Cash provided by discontinued operations was $753.6 primarily driven by income from operations of discontinued operations, which excludes the noncash impairment charge, of $386.1 and long-term debt proceeds from Versum's Term Loan B of $575.0, partially offset by capital expenditures for plant and equipment of $245.1. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. For the year ended 2015, cash used by discontinued operations was $47.2. The use of cash was primarily driven by expenditures for plant and equipment of $452.4 which primarily related to the Energy-from-Waste facilities. This use of cash was partially offset by income from discontinued operations of $344.6. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.40Table of ContentsFinancing and Capital StructureCapital needs in 2017 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2017, total debt outstanding was $3,962.8 compared to $5,210.9 at the end of 2016, and cash and cash items were $3,273.6 compared to $1,293.2 at the end of 2016. On 31 March 2017, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “2017 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The 2017 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. The Company’s only financial covenant is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (total debt plus total equity) no greater than 70%. Total debt at 30 September 2017 and 2016, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt plus total equity), was 28.0% and 41.9%, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2017. The 2017 Credit Agreement terminates and replaces our previous $2,690.0 revolving credit agreement (the “2013 Credit Agreement”), which was to mature 30 April 2018. No borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement at the time of its termination, and no early termination penalties were incurred.Commitments totaling $23.4 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, all of which was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2017.As of 30 September 2017, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2017, 2016 or 2015. At 30 September 2017, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains. 2018 OutlookCash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future and our working capital balance was $3,387.7 at 30 September 2017. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants.On 16 October 2017, we repaid a 1.2% Senior Note of $400 that matured on 15 October 2017. As of 30 September 2017, this note was reflected in current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. DividendsDividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. During 2017, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from $.86 per share to $.95 per share.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSWe are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations on a continuing operations basis as of 30 September 2017: Total20182019202020212022ThereafterLong-term debt obligations Debt maturities$3,837$416$409$356$433$401$1,822Contractual interest4387675574937144Capital leases302223120Operating leases3145746352723126Pension obligations6985247474648458Unconditional purchase obligations6,5338222342753092854,608Obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate100——100———Total Contractual Obligations$11,950$1,425$813$872$867$795$7,17841Table of ContentsLong-Term Debt ObligationsThe long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt.Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $655 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2017, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2017. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates and by interbank offer rates.LeasesRefer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases.Pension ObligationsThe amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities, less the net pension liability transferred to discontinued operations. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment.The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions.Unconditional Purchase ObligationsApproximately $5,600 of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium purchases, which include crude feedstock supply to multiple helium refining plants in North America as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world. As a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain take-or-pay provisions. The refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas, primarily under medium-term requirements contracts. While contract terms in the energy sector are longer than those in merchant, helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties.Approximately $280 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers.Purchase commitments to spend approximately $300 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2018. In addition, we have purchase commitments totaling approximately $180 in 2018 relating to our long-term sale of equipment project for Saudi Aramco’s Jazan oil refinery.We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices.Obligation for Future Contribution to an Equity AffiliateOn 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan. In total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. As of 30 September 2017 and 2016, we recorded a noncurrent liability of $94.4 for our obligation to make future equity contributions in 2020 based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan. 42Table of ContentsInvestment in Joint VentureOn 10 September 2017, Air Products signed an agreement to form a joint venture, Air Products Lu’an (Changzhi) Co., Ltd., with Lu’An Clean Energy Company. Air Products has already invested $300 million to build, own, and operate four large air separation units to supply the Changzhi City site. Under the agreement, Air Products will contribute the air separation units and invest an additional $500. Air Products will own 60% of the joint venture and will consolidate its financial results. Closing will occur upon the completion of initial operational start-up and government and regulatory approvals. Due to the uncertainty of those milestones, the additional investment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Income Tax LiabilitiesNoncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2017 were $778.4. Tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2017 were $146.4. These tax liabilities were excluded from the Contractual Obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.PENSION BENEFITSThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.The fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2017 measurement date increased to $4,409.2 from $4,116.4 at the end of fiscal year 2016. The projected benefit obligation for these plans was $5,107.1 and $5,327.3 at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The net unfunded liability decreased by approximately $513 from $1,211 to $698, primarily due to higher discount rates, favorable asset experience and the effects of the Versum spin-off and the sale of PMD to Evonik. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits.Pension Expense 201720162015Pension expense – Continuing operations$72.0$55.8$115.0Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above)15.06.030.5Weighted average discount rate(A)3.0%4.1%4.0%Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets7.4%7.5%7.4%Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase3.5%3.5%3.5%(A) Effective in 2016, the Company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs. The Company accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it prospectively. This change did not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation.2017 vs. 2016 Pension expense, excluding special items, increased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate offset by favorable asset experience. Special items of $15.0 included pension settlement losses of $10.5 related to the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan, curtailment and special termination benefits of $4.5, $2.5 of which was reflected in ""Business separation costs"" and $2.0 reflected in ""Business restructuring and cost reduction actions"" on the consolidated income statements.2016 vs. 2015Pension expense, excluding special items, decreased from fiscal year 2015 due to the adoption of the spot rate approach, which reduced service cost and interest cost, and the impacts from expected return on assets and demographic gains, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans. Special items of $6.0 included pension settlement losses of $5.1, special termination benefits of $2.0, and curtailment gains of $1.1. These resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions.43Table of Contents2018 OutlookIn 2018, pension expense, excluding special items, is expected to be relatively flat compared to 2017 with a range of approximately $50 to $55. This results from lower loss amortization primarily due to favorable asset experience, offset by the impact of lower discount rates and a lower expected return on assets. Pension settlement losses of $5 to $10 are expected, depending on the timing of retirements. In 2018, we expect pension expense to include approximately $128 for amortization of actuarial losses. In 2017, total company pension expense, which includes both continuing and discontinued operations, included amortization of actuarial losses of $143. Net actuarial losses of $352 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2017. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2018.As noted in Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements, we expect to early adopt guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost in 2018. The amendments require that the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost be presented in the same line items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost will be presented outside of operating income. Pension FundingPension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2017 and 2016, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $64.1 and $79.3, respectively.For 2018, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $50 to $70. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, whichare dependent upon the timing of retirements and future cost reduction actions. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on pages 41-43 for a projection of future contributions.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $11.4, $12.2, and $11.8 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $7 in 2017, $3 in 2016, and $2 in 2015 on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $3 in both 2018 and 2019.We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $83 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $97 as of 30 September 2017. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2017 and 2016 included an accrual of $83.6 and $81.4, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; 44Table of Contentsand Pasadena, Texas, locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities.Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year.Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (""GHG""), including carbon dioxide. These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, California and Ontario cap and trade schemes, Alberta’s Specified Gas Emitters Regulation, China’s Emission Trading Scheme pilots, South Korea’s Emission Trading Scheme, and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions under an Ontario cap and trade scheme, nation-wide expansion of the China Emission Trading Scheme, and revisions to the Alberta regulation. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs. Increased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and hydrogen production. We believe it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from steam methane reforming, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSOur principal related parties are equity affiliates operating in the industrial gas business. In 2015, we entered into a long-term sale of equipment contract to engineer, procure, and construct industrial gas facilities with a 25%‑owned joint venture for Saudi Aramco’s Jazan oil refinery and power plant in Saudi Arabia. The agreement included terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party. Sales related to this contract are included in the results of our Industrial Gases – Global segment and were approximately $540 and $300 during fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales related to this contract were not material during fiscal year 2015.INFLATIONWe operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis.45Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESNote 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee.Depreciable Lives of Plant and EquipmentNet plant and equipment at 30 September 2017 totaled $8,440.2, and depreciation expense totaled $843.2 during 2017. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.The regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.Our regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts aregenerally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change.A change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional Industrial Gases segments would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease LifeBy 1 Year Increase LifeBy 1 YearIndustrial Gases – Regional $40 $(35)Impairment of AssetsPlant and EquipmentPlant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.46Table of ContentsIf such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.On 29 March 2016, the Board of Directors approved the Company’s exit of its Energy-from-Waste business. Accordingly, we assessed the recoverability of capital costs for the two projects associated with this business and recorded an impairment charge to the results of discontinued operations of $913.5 to reduce the carrying values of plant assets to their estimated net realizable value. We estimated the net realizable value of the projects assuming an orderly liquidation of assets capable of being marketed on a secondary equipment market based on market quotes and our experience with selling similar equipment. An asset’s orderly liquidation value is the amount that could be realized from a liquidation sale, given a reasonable period of time to find a buyer, selling the asset in the existing condition where it is located, and assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. The valuation includes inputs that are unobservable and therefore considered Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. The loss was measured as the difference between the orderly liquidation value of the assets and the net book value of the assets. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we recorded an additional loss of $6.3 to update our estimate of the net realizable value of the plant assets as of 31 December 2016 of $11.0. In addition, a charge of $45.7 was recorded to continuing operations to write-down the air separation unit in the Industrials Gases–EMEA segment that was constructed mainly to provide oxygen to one of the Energy-from-Waste plants to its net realizable value of $1.4. There have been no changes to our estimates during the remainder of 2017. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, and Note 5, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions, for additional information.In the third quarter of 2017, we performed interim impairment testing of our Latin America reporting unit (LASA) long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, as of 30 June 2017. See the discussions below under Goodwill and Intangible Assets on 2017 Impairment Testing. We also tested the recoverability of LASA's long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, and concluded that they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows. GoodwillThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $721.5 as of 30 September 2017. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for more frequent testing. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five business segments and eleven reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each business segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the three regional Industrial Gases segments.As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. We chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing, as further described below.47Table of ContentsAs described in Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements, we elected to early adopt the new accounting guidance which simplified the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2, which measured the impairment loss based on the fair value of goodwill. Under the new guidance, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.2017 Impairment TestingFor the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, volumes declined in our Latin America reporting unit (LASA), and overall revenue growth did not meet expectations. Due to weak economic conditions in Latin America and expectations for continued volume weakness in the Latin American countries and markets in which we operate, we lowered our long-term growth projections for LASA by more than 200 basis points, which also unfavorably impacted our EBITDA margin. Management considered the revised projections for LASA to be indicators of potential impairment and, accordingly, performed interim impairment testing of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, as of 30 June 2017 utilizing the revised projections. LASA represents approximately 6% of the Company’s total revenue with business units in Chile, Colombia, and other Latin America countries. We estimated the fair value of LASA as of 30 June 2017 based on two valuation approaches, the income approach and the market approach, as described above. We reviewed relevant facts and circumstances in determining the weighting of the approaches. Under the income approach, we estimated the fair value of LASA based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, taking into consideration business and market conditions for the Latin American countries and markets in which we operate. These estimates were consistent with our revised forecast and long-term financial planning processes, which included a reduction in sales growth by more than 200 basis points from that previously identified. We calculated the discount rate based on a market-participant, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which considers industry-specific rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure, adjusted for risks associated with business size and geography. Under the market approach, we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publicly-traded industrial gases companies and regional manufacturing companies, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects.Based on the results of the valuations, we determined that the goodwill associated with LASA was impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of $145.3, the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, during the third quarter of 2017. This impairment is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge.” This charge was not deductible for tax purposes and has been excluded from segment operating income.During the fourth quarter of 2017, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing. We determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except LASA, for which the fair value equaled the carrying value. 48Table of ContentsThe excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units other than LASA ranged from approximately 80% to approximately 350%. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of these reporting units. In this scenario, the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 60% to 300%.As of 30 September 2017, the carrying value of Latin America goodwill was $67.3, or less than 1% of consolidated total assets. Further events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to a decline in market share, pricing pressures, and further economic weakening in the markets we serve. Revenue growth and EBITDA margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value of LASA. We determined that, with other assumptions held constant, a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 125 basis points or a decrease in EBITDA margin of approximately 225 basis points would result in an impairment of the remaining goodwill balance. The carrying value of LASA's other material assets at 30 September 2017 included: Plant and equipment, net of $345.3; customer relationships of $166.3; and trade names and trademarks of $46.9. The trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.We will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results or changes in management’s business outlook or strategy.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets with determinable lives at 30 September 2017 totaled $321.4 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined.Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2017 totaled $46.9 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.2017 Impairment TestingIn the third quarter of 2017, we conducted an interim impairment test and determined that the carrying value of the LASA indefinite-lived intangible assets was impaired. We determined that the carrying value of trade names and trademarks was in excess of fair value, and as a result, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $16.8 to reduce these indefinite-lived intangible assets to their fair value. This impairment is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge""In the fourth quarter of 2017, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles and found no indications of impairment.49Table of ContentsEquity InvestmentsInvestments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,286.9 at 30 September 2017. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other‑than‑temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. We utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach. For the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co., Ltd. (AHG), a 25%‑owned equity affiliate in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment, completed a review of its business plan and outlook. As a result of the revised business plan, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in AHG and, therefore, recorded a noncash impairment charge of $79.5 to reduce the carrying value of our investment. This charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “Equity affiliates' income” and was not deductible for tax purposes. The decline in value results from expectations for lower future cash flows to be generated by AHG, primarily due to challenging economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, including the impacts of lower prices in the oil and gas industry, increased competition, and capital project growth opportunities not materializing as anticipated. The AHG investment was valued based on the results of the income and market valuation approaches. The income approach utilized a discount rate based on a market-participant, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which considers industry required rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure adjusted for risks associated with size and geography. Other significant estimates and assumptions that drive our updated valuation of AHG include revenue growth rates and profit margins that were lower than those upon acquisition and our assessment of AHG's business improvement plan effectiveness. Under the market approach, we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publicly-traded industrial gases companies engaged in similar lines of business, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects.As of 30 September 2017, the carrying value of our investment in AHG is $66.7 and is reflected in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment. The investment is reported in “Investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates” on our consolidated balance sheets.Revenue Recognition – Percentage-of-Completion MethodRevenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, revenue from the sale of major equipment, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchangers and large air separation units, is recognized based on costs or labor hours incurred to date compared with total estimated costs or labor hours to be incurred. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete the contract and recognize the profit over the life of the contract.Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule and technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs or labor hours are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.Our Jazan large air separation unit sale of equipment project within our Industrial Gases – Global segment spans several years. In addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and 50Table of Contentsconstruction activities, this project requires monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, including the Jazan project, favorably impacted operating income by approximately $27 in fiscal year 2017 and $20 in fiscal year 2016. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years. Changes in estimates during fiscal year 2015 were not significant.We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. At 30 September 2017, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $98.6 and $603.9, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2017 were $146.4, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2017 was $260.9. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $14.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans.Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent Society of Actuaries tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. Effective in 2016, the Company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs. The Company accounted for this as a change in accounting 51Table of Contentsestimate and, accordingly accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change did not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. This rate changes from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $36 per year.The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $19 per year.We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. For equities, this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $15 per year.Loss ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies (i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us). We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount withinthis range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCEIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted guidance requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt instead of as a separate deferred asset. The guidance resulted in a reclassification adjustment that decreased other noncurrent assets by $17.0 with a corresponding decrease to long-term debt as of 30 September 2016. We have elected to continue to present debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit arrangement as a deferred asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted guidance that simplified the accounting for employee share-based payments. The new guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be 52Table of Contentsrecognized in the income statement rather than in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. As a result of applying this change prospectively, we recognized $17.6 of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes during fiscal year 2017. Adoption of this guidance resulted in the presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than a financing activity. We applied these presentation changes retrospectively to all periods presented.In the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we elected to early adopt guidance which simplified the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2, which measured the impairment loss based on the fair value of goodwill. Under the new guidance, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 10, Goodwill, for a discussion of our interim and annual goodwill impairment tests. See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about business outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this report. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, global or regional economic conditions and supply and demand dynamics in market segments into which the Company sells; political risks, including the risks of unanticipated government actions; acts of war or terrorism; the inability to eliminate stranded costs previously allocated to the Company's Electronic Materials and Performance Materials divisions, which have been divested, and other unexpected impacts of the divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; future financial and operating performance of major customers; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; our ability to execute the projects in our backlog; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific events; the impact of price fluctuations in natural gas and disruptions in markets and the economy due to oil price volatility; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory investigations; the success of productivity and operational improvement programs; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures, including reputational impacts; the Company's ability to implement and operate with new technologies; the impact of changes in environmental, tax or other legislation, economic sanctions and regulatory activities in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; and other risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this report to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based.53Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter intotransactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements.At 30 September 2017 and 2016, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $3,832.3 and $4,195.6, respectively. The decrease in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt.The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date.Interest Rate RiskOur debt portfolio as of 30 September 2017, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 65% fixed-rate debt and 35% variable-rate debt. Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2016, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 55% fixed-rate debt and 45% variable-rate debt. The change in debt portfolio composition was due primarily to the repayment of commercial paper.The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2017, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $112 and $137 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2017 and 2016, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $119 and $148 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2017 and 2016, respectively.Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $14 and $24 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2017 and 2016, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $14 and $24 per year at 30 September 2017 and 2016, respectively.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2017 and 2016, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $312 and $422 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in exchange rate sensitivity from 30 September 2016 to 30 September 2017 was due primarily to a reduction in our portfolio of forward exchange contracts. Refer to Note 13, Financial Instruments, for additional information about our outstanding forward exchange contracts.54Table of ContentsThe primary currency pair for which we have exchange rate exposure is Euros and U.S. Dollars. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.The majority of the Company’s sales are derived from outside of the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. Financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Euro and the Chinese Renminbi represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Euro or the Chinese Renminbi versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $25 and $20, respectively.55Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:38.477258

The Company’s core industrial gases business provides atmospheric, process, and specialty gases and related equipment to many industries including refining, chemical, gasification, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. Air Products is also the world’s leading supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) process technology and equipment. With operations in 50 countries, in fiscal year 2018 we had sales of $8.9 billion, assets of $19.2 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 16,300 full- and part-time employees.As of 30 September 2018, our operations were organized into five reportable business segments: Industrial Gases – Americas; Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa); Industrial Gases – Asia; Industrial Gases – Global; and Corporate and other. The financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on these operations. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.20Table of Contents2018 IN SUMMARYIn fiscal year 2018, we delivered strong safety and financial results. Sales of $8.9 billion increased nine percent over the prior year primarily driven by higher volumes from base business growth and new, large industrial gas project onstreams. The higher regional volumes were partially offset by lower sale of equipment activity on our Jazan project as we near project completion. In addition, we began to execute our gasification strategy with the completion and onstream of the Lu'An acquisition and our announcements of the Jazan gasifier/power project in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, the Yankuang coal-to-syngas production facility in Yulin City, Shaanxi Province, China, and the Jiutai coal-to-syngas project in Hohhot, China.We delivered operating margin of 22.0% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.9%. Diluted EPS of $6.59 increased 28% from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted diluted EPS of $7.45 increased 18%.Highlights for 2018•Sales of $8,930.2 increased 9%, or $742.6, from underlying sales growth of 7% and favorable currency impacts of 2%. The underlying sales growth was primarily driven by higher volumes across all regional Industrial Gases segments, partially offset by lower sale of equipment activity in the Industrial Gases – Global segment.•Operating income of $1,965.6 increased 37%, or $525.6, and operating margin of 22.0% increased 440 bp. On a non‑GAAP basis, adjusted operating income of $1,941.5 increased 9%, or $167.7, and adjusted operating margin of 21.7% was flat.•Income from continuing operations of $1,455.6 increased 28%, or $321.2, and diluted EPS of $6.59 increased 28%, or $1.43. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted income from continuing operations of $1,644.7 increased 19%, or $258.8, and adjusted diluted EPS of $7.45 increased 18%, or $1.14. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented on the following page.•Adjusted EBITDA of $3,115.5 increased 11%, or $316.3. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.9% increased 70 bp.•We completed the formation of a syngas supply joint venture with Lu'An, including the acquisition of Lu'An's gasification and syngas purification assets.•We increased our quarterly dividend by 16% from $.95 to $1.10 per share, or $4.40 per share annually, the largest increase in Company history. This represents the 36th consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment.21Table of ContentsChanges in Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to Air Products Increase 2018 2017 (Decrease)Diluted Earnings per Share Net income $6.78 $13.65 ($6.87)Income from discontinued operations .19 8.49 (8.30)Income from Continuing Operations – GAAP $6.59 $5.16 $1.43Operating Income Impact (after-tax) Underlying business Volume $.71Price/raw materials .16Costs (.45)Currency .16Change in inventory valuation method .08Business separation costs .12Cost reduction and asset actions .49Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge .70Gain on land sale (.03)Total Operating Income Impact (after-tax) $1.94Other Impact (after-tax) Equity affiliates' income .15Equity method investment impairment charge .36Interest expense (.03)Other non-operating income (expense), net (.04)Income tax .44Tax reform repatriation (2.16)Tax reform benefit related to deemed foreign dividends .25Tax reform rate change and other .96Tax restructuring .16Tax benefit associated with business separation (.02)Tax election benefit (.50)Noncontrolling interests (.05)Weighted average diluted shares (.03)Total Other Impact (after-tax) ($.51)Total Change in Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations – GAAP Measure $1.4322Table of Contents Increase 2018 2017 (Decrease)Income from Continuing Operations – GAAP Basis $6.59 $5.16 $1.43Change in inventory valuation method (.08) — ($.08)Business separation costs — .12 (.12)Tax benefit associated with business separation — (.02) .02Cost reduction and asset actions — .49 (.49)Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge — .70 (.70)Gain on land sale — (.03) .03Equity method investment impairment charge — .36 (.36)Pension settlement loss .15 .03 .12Tax reform repatriation 2.16 — 2.16Tax reform benefit related to deemed foreign dividends (.25) — (.25)Tax reform rate change and other (.96) — (.96)Tax restructuring (.16) — (.16)Tax election benefit — (.50) .50Income from Continuing Operations – Non-GAAP Measure $7.45 $6.31 $1.142019 OUTLOOKIn fiscal year 2019, we intend to grow our earnings by continuing to improve our base businesses and by bringing new, large projects onstream. We expect the full year impact of the Lu'An project to be a large contributor to our earnings growth. Backed by our strong financial position, we will strive to continue to win and invest in key growth projects, including large gasification projects that are consistent with our onsite business model. In addition, we expect lower sale of equipment activity from our Jazan project as it nears completion.The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDiscussion of Consolidated Results 201820172016Sales$8,930.2$8,187.6$7,503.7Operating income1,965.61,440.01,535.1Operating margin22.0%17.6%20.5%Equity affiliates’ income174.880.1147.0Income from continuing operations1,455.61,134.41,099.5Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted EBITDA$3,115.5$2,799.2$2,621.8Adjusted EBITDA margin34.9%34.2%34.9%Adjusted operating income1,941.51,773.81,620.2Adjusted operating margin21.7%21.7%21.6%Adjusted equity affiliates' income203.3159.6147.023Table of Contents % Change from Prior Year Sales20182017Underlying business Volume6%6 %Price1%1 %Energy and raw material cost pass-through—%3 %Currency2%(1)%Total Consolidated Sales Change9%9 %2018 vs. 2017 Sales of $8,930.2 increased 9%, or $742.6. Underlying sales increased 7% from higher volumes of 6% and higher pricing of 1%. Volumes were higher across all regional Industrial Gases segments driven by new project onstreams, primarily in the Industrial Gases – Asia and Industrial Gases – EMEA segments, underlying base business growth, and an equipment sale resulting from the termination of a contract in the Industrial Gases – Asia segment. The regional volume increase was partially offset by lower sale of equipment activity in the Industrial Gases – Global segment. The pricing improvement was primarily attributable to the China and Europe merchant businesses. Energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers was flat versus the prior year. Favorable currency impacts, primarily from the Euro, the British Pound Sterling, and the Chinese Renminbi, increased sales by 2%.2017 vs. 2016 Sales of $8,187.6 increased 9.0%, or $683.9. Underlying sales increased 7% from higher volumes of 6% and higher pricing of 1%. Higher volumes, primarily due to new project onstreams, underlying base business growth across the Industrial Gases regions, and continued progress on the Jazan project within our Industrial Gases – Global segment, were partially offset by lower LNG project activity in the Corporate and other segment. The pricing improvement was primarily attributable to the Industrial Gases – Asia segment. Higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 3%, and unfavorable currency effects reduced sales by 1%.Operating Income and Margin2018 vs. 2017Operating income of $1,965.6 increased 37%, or $525.6, due to higher volumes of $204, a prior year goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $162, prior year cost reduction and asset actions of $151, favorable currency impacts of $47, favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs, of $47, prior year business separation costs of $33, and a favorable impact from the change in inventory valuation method of $24, partially offset by unfavorable net operating costs of $130 and a prior year gain on land sale of $12. The increase in net operating costs was primarily driven by higher planned maintenance costs, lower cost reimbursement, including costs for transitions services, and higher costs to support growth opportunities. Operating margin of 22.0% increased 440 bp, primarily due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, cost reduction and asset actions, and business separation costs in the prior year.On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating income of $1,941.5 increased 9%, or $167.7, primarily due to higher volumes, favorable currency impacts, and favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs, partially offset by unfavorable net operating costs. Adjusted operating margin of 21.7% was flat as higher volumes and favorable pricing, net of power costs, were mostly offset by higher costs.2017 vs. 2016 Operating income of $1,440.0 decreased 6%, or $95.1, as a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $162, higher cost reduction and asset actions of $117, and unfavorable currency impacts of $9 were partially offset by favorable volumes of $83, favorable net operating costs of $73, lower business separation costs of $18, a gain on sale of land of $12, and favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs of $7. Operating margin of 17.6% decreased 290 bp, primarily due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge and higher cost reduction and asset actions.On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating income of $1,773.8 increased 9%, or $153.6, primarily due to higher volumes and favorable cost performance. Adjusted operating margin of 21.7% increased 10 bp as lower costs were partially offset by higher energy and natural gas pass-through to customers.24Table of ContentsAdjusted EBITDAWe define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance.2018 vs. 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $3,115.5 increased 11%, or $316.3, primarily due to higher volumes, favorable currency, positive pricing, and income from regional industrial gases equity affiliates, partially offset by higher costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.9% increased 70 bp, primarily due to higher volumes and income from regional industrial gases equity affiliates, partially offset by higher costs.2017 vs. 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,799.2 increased 7%, or $177.4, primarily due to higher volumes and favorable cost performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.2% decreased 70 bp, primarily due to a 90 bp impact from higher energy pass-through to customers.Equity Affiliates’ Income2018 vs. 2017 Income from equity affiliates of $174.8 increased $94.7. The fiscal year 2017 income included a noncash impairment charge of $79.5 ($.36 per share) on our investment in Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co., Ltd. (AHG), a 25%-owned equity affiliate in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment. This charge has been excluded from segment results. Refer to Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Fiscal year 2018 included an expense of $28.5 resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted equity affiliates' income of $203.3 increased 27%, or $43.7, primarily driven by Industrial Gases – Americas and Industrial Gases – EMEA affiliates.2017 vs. 2016 Income from equity affiliates of $80.1 decreased $66.9, primarily due to a noncash impairment charge of $79.5 ($.36 per share) on our investment in AHG in fiscal year 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted equity affiliates' income of $159.6 increased 9%, or $12.6.Cost of Sales and Gross Margin2018 vs. 2017 Cost of sales of $6,189.5 increased 8%, or $438.0, primarily due to higher costs attributable to sales volumes of $225, unfavorable currency impacts of $133, and higher other costs, including maintenance costs, of $97, partially offset by the benefit from the change in inventory valuation method from a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis to a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis of $24 in fiscal year 2018. For additional information on the change in inventory valuation method, refer to Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 7, Inventories, to the consolidated financial statements.Gross margin of 30.7% increased 90 bp, primarily due to higher volumes, favorable pricing, net of raw materials, and the benefit from the change in inventory valuation adjustment, partially offset by higher other costs.2017 vs. 2016 Cost of sales of $5,751.5 increased 11%, or $574.2, due to higher costs attributable to sales volumes of $418, higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of $218, and higher other costs of $21, partially offset by favorable currency impacts of $83.Gross margin of 29.8% decreased 120 bp, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers and unfavorable volume mix.25Table of ContentsSelling and Administrative Expense2018 vs. 2017 Selling and administrative expense of $760.8 increased 7%, or $47.3, primarily driven by unfavorable currency impacts and higher costs to support growth opportunities, partially offset by cost reductions associated with the completion of transition services agreements with Versum and Evonik. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 8.5% in fiscal year 2018 from 8.7% in fiscal year 2017.2017 vs. 2016 Selling and administrative expense of $713.5 increased 4%, or $29.7, primarily due to costs in support of transition services agreements with Versum and Evonik, for which the reimbursement is reflected in ""Other income (expense), net."" Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 8.7% in fiscal year 2017 from 9.1% in fiscal year 2016.Research and Development2018 vs. 2017 Research and development expense of $64.5 increased 12%, or $6.9. Research and development expense as a percent of sales in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was .7%.2017 vs. 2016 Research and development expense of $57.6 decreased 20%, or $14.2. Research and development expense as a percent of sales decreased to .7% in fiscal year 2017 from 1.0% in fiscal year 2016.Business Separation CostsIn fiscal year 2017, we completed the separation of the divisions comprising the former Materials Technologies segment through the spin-off of the Electronics Materials Division (EMD) as Versum Materials, Inc. (Versum) and the sale of the Performance Materials Division (PMD) to Evonik Industries AG (Evonik). For additional information on the dispositions, refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements.In connection with the dispositions, we incurred net separation costs of $30.2 ($26.5 after-tax, or $.12 per share) in fiscal year 2017. The net costs include legal and advisory fees of $32.5, which are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Business separation costs,” and a pension settlement benefit of $2.3 presented within ""Other non-operating income (expense), net."" Our fiscal year 2017 income tax provision includes net tax benefits of $5.5 ($.02 per share), primarily related to changes in tax positions on business separation activities.In fiscal year 2016, we incurred business separation costs of $50.6 ($46.7 after-tax, or $.21 per share) for legal and advisory fees. Our fiscal year 2016 income tax provision includes additional tax expense related to the separation of $51.8 ($.24 per share), of which $45.7 resulted from a dividend to repatriate $443.8 from a subsidiary in South Korea to the U.S. in anticipation of the separation of EMD from the industrial gases business in South Korea.Cost Reduction and Asset Actions In fiscal year 2017, we recognized a net expense of $151.4 ($109.3 attributable to Air Products, after-tax, or $.49 per share) for cost reduction and asset actions. The year-to-date net expense included a charge of $154.8 for actions taken during fiscal year 2017, partially offset by the favorable settlement of the remaining $3.4 accrued balance associated with business restructuring actions taken in 2015. The charge included asset actions of $88.5 and severance actions of $66.3.In fiscal year 2016, we recognized an expense of $34.5 ($24.7 after-tax, or $.11 per share) for severance and other benefits.The charges we record for cost reduction and asset actions have been excluded from segment operating income. Refer to Note 5, Cost Reduction and Asset Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions.26Table of ContentsGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment ChargeDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily acquired trade names) associated with our Latin America reporting unit of our Industrial Gases – Americas segment were impaired. We recorded a noncash impairment charge of $162.1 ($154.1 attributable to Air Products, after-tax, or $.70 per share), which was driven by lower economic growth and profitability in the region. This impairment charge has been excluded from segment results. Refer to Note 10, Goodwill, and Note 11, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetItems recorded to ""Other income (expense), net"" arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of ""Other income (expense), net"" is presented in Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements.2018 vs. 2017 Other income (expense), net of $50.2 decreased $70.8, primarily due to lower income from the transition services agreements with Versum and Evonik, lower income from the sale of assets and investments, lower favorable contract settlements, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.2017 vs. 2016 Other income (expense), net of $121.0 increased $71.6, primarily due to income from transition services agreements with Versum and Evonik, income from the sale of assets and investments, including a gain of $12.2 ($7.6 after-tax, or $.03 per share) resulting from the sale of a parcel of land, and a favorable foreign exchange impact.Interest Expense 201820172016Interest incurred$150.0$139.6$147.9Less: Capitalized interest19.519.032.7Interest Expense$130.5$120.6$115.22018 vs. 2017 Interest incurred increased $10.4 as project financing associated with the Lu'An joint venture and a higher average interest rate on the debt portfolio were partially offset by the impact from a lower average debt balance. The change in capitalized interest was driven by an increase in the carrying value of projects under construction.2017 vs. 2016 Interest incurred decreased $8.3 as the impact from a lower average debt balance of $26 was partially offset by the impact from a higher average interest rate on the debt portfolio of $19. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in the carrying value of projects under construction, primarily as a result of our decision to exit from the EfW business.Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net2018 vs. 2017 Other non-operating income (expense), net of $5.1 decreased $11.5. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recognized a pension settlement loss of $43.7 ($33.2 after-tax, or $.15 per share) that primarily resulted from the transfer of certain pension payment obligations to an insurer for our U.S. salaried and hourly plans through the purchase of an irrevocable, nonparticipating group annuity contract with plan assets. For additional information, refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. This loss was partially offset by higher interest income on cash and cash items and short-term investments and lower other non-service pension expense. The prior year pension expense included a settlement loss of $10.5 ($6.6 after-tax, or $.03 per share) associated with the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan and a settlement benefit of $2.3 related to the disposition of EMD and PMD.27Table of Contents2017 vs. 2016 Other non-operating income of $16.6 increased $22.0 from an expense of $5.4 in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to interest income on cash and time deposits, which are comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of PMD. Fiscal year 2016 included a pension settlement loss of $5.1 ($3.3 after-tax, or $.02 per share) to accelerate recognition of a portion of actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, primarily associated with the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan. In fiscal year 2016, interest income was included in ""Other income (expense), net"" and was not material. Loss on Extinguishment of DebtOn 30 September 2016, in anticipation of the spin-off of EMD, Versum issued $425.0 of notes to Air Products, who then exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for $418.3 of Air Products’ outstanding commercial paper. This noncash exchange, which was excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows, resulted in a loss of $6.9 ($4.3 after-tax, or $.02 per share). This loss was deductible for tax purposes.Effective Tax RateThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate.2018 vs. 2017 The effective tax rate was 26.0% and 18.4% in fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The current year rate was higher primarily due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""the Tax Act"") in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% that became effective 1 January 2018, a deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as other changes. As a result of the Tax Act, our income tax provision for fiscal year 2018 reflects a discrete net income tax expense of $180.6. This included a deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted foreign earnings and adjustments to the future cost of repatriation from foreign investments of $448.6, partially offset by a benefit of $56.2 related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends under the Tax Act. This benefit may be eliminated by future legislation. Fiscal year 2018 tax expense also includes a benefit of $211.8, primarily from the re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the lower corporate tax rate. In fiscal year 2018, we also recorded a tax benefit of $35.7 from the restructuring of foreign subsidiaries.The income tax provision in fiscal year 2017 included a net income tax benefit of $111.4 resulting from a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary. The effective tax rate in the prior year was also impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of $145.3 in our Latin America reporting unit and an impairment of $79.5 of an equity method investment for which no tax benefits were available.On a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted effective tax rate decreased from 23.2% in fiscal year 2017 to 18.6% in fiscal year 2018. We estimate that the lower U.S. federal statutory rate and other impacts of the Tax Act reduced our fiscal year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate by approximately 3.5%. The current year rate was also lower due to a benefit of $9.1 related to a final foreign tax audit settlement.We are reporting the impacts of the Tax Act provisionally based upon reasonable estimates as of 30 September 2018. The impacts are not yet finalized as they are dependent on factors and analysis not yet known or fully completed, including but not limited to, further book to U.S. tax adjustments for the earnings of foreign entities, the issuance of additional guidance, as well as our ongoing analysis of the Tax Act. As a fiscal year-end taxpayer, certain provisions of the Tax Act became effective in our fiscal year 2018, while other provisions do not become effective until fiscal year 2019. The corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of 1 January 2018 and, accordingly, reduces our 2018 fiscal year U.S. federal statutory rate to a blended rate of approximately 24.5%.28Table of Contents2017 vs. 2016 The effective tax rate was 18.4% and 27.8% in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. The 2017 rate included an impact of approximately 700 bp from a net income tax benefit resulting from a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary and an impact of approximately 100 bp from excess tax benefits on share-based compensation resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. These impacts were partially offset by an increase of approximately 200 bp due to both a goodwill impairment charge in our Latin America reporting unit and an impairment of an equity method investment for which no tax benefits were available. The 2016 rate included a 330 bp impact from tax costs associated with business separation, primarily resulting from a dividend declared in 2016 to repatriate cash from a foreign subsidiary as discussed above under Business Separation Costs. The remaining change was primarily due to the impact of business separation costs for which a tax benefit was estimated to not be available. On a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted effective tax rate decreased from 24.2% in fiscal year 2016 to 23.2% in fiscal year 2017, primarily due to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.Discontinued OperationsIn fiscal year 2018, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $42.2 includes an income tax benefit of $25.6 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions taken in conjunction with the disposition of our former European Homecare business in fiscal year 2012. In addition, we recorded an after-tax benefit of $17.6 resulting from the resolution of certain post-closing adjustments associated with the sale of PMD. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These benefits were partially offset by an after-tax loss of $1.0 related to EfW project exit activities, which were completed during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.In fiscal year 2017, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $1,866.0 includes a gain of $2,870 ($1,828 after-tax, or $8.32 per share) for the sale of PMD to Evonik. The sale closed on 3 January 2017 for $3.8 billion in cash. In addition, we recorded a loss on the disposal of EfW of $59.3 ($47.1 after-tax) during the first quarter of 2017, primarily for land lease obligations and to update our estimate of the net realizable value of the plant assets.In fiscal year 2016, the loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $460.5 includes a loss of $945.7 ($846.6 after-tax) from the write down of EfW plant assets to their estimated net realizable value and a liability recorded for plant disposition and other costs. This loss was partially offset by the results of PMD and EMD.Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Segment AnalysisIndustrial Gases – Americas 201820172016Sales$3,758.8$3,637.0$3,344.1Operating income927.9946.1891.3Operating margin24.7%26.0%26.7%Equity affiliates’ income82.058.152.7Adjusted EBITDA1,495.21,468.61,387.6Adjusted EBITDA margin39.8%40.4%41.5% % Change from Prior Year Sales20182017Underlying business Volume4 %2%Price— %—%Energy and raw material cost pass-through(1)%6%Currency— %1%Total Industrial Gases – Americas Sales Change3 %9%29Table of Contents2018 vs. 2017 Sales of $3,758.8 increased 3%, or $121.8.

These financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. In many cases, our non-GAAP measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to exclude certain disclosed items (“non-GAAP adjustments”) that we believe are not representative of the underlying business performance. For example, in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we restructured the Company to focus on its core Industrial Gases business. This resulted in significant cost reduction and asset actions that we believe were important for investors to understand separately from the performance of the underlying business. Additionally, in fiscal year 2018, we recorded discrete impacts associated with the Tax Act. The reader should be aware that we may incur similar expenses in the future.The tax impact on our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions. Investors should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we adopted accounting guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2018 presentation. Refer to Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 33Table of ContentsPresented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures:CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Continuing Operations OperatingIncomeOperatingMargin(A)Equity Affiliates' IncomeIncome Tax ProvisionNetIncomeDilutedEPS2018 GAAP$1,965.622.0 %$174.8$524.3$1,455.6$6.592017 GAAP1,440.017.6 %80.1260.91,134.45.16Change GAAP$525.6440bp$94.7$263.4$321.2$1.43% Change GAAP37% 118%101 %28%28%2018 GAAP$1,965.622.0 %$174.8$524.3$1,455.6$6.59Change in inventory valuation method(24.1)(.3)%—(6.6)(17.5)(.08)Pension settlement loss(B)—— %—10.533.2.15Tax reform repatriation—— %28.5(448.6)477.12.16Tax reform benefit related to deemed foreign dividends—— %—56.2(56.2)(.25)Tax reform rate change and other—— %—211.8(211.8)(.96)Tax restructuring—— %—35.7(35.7)(.16)2018 Non-GAAP Measure$1,941.521.7 %$203.3$383.3$1,644.7$7.452017 GAAP$1,440.017.6 %$80.1$260.9$1,134.4$5.16Business separation costs32.5.4 %—3.726.5.12Tax benefit associated with business separation—— %—5.5(5.5)(.02)Cost reduction and asset actions(C)151.41.8 %—41.6109.3.49Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge(D)162.12.0 %—4.6154.1.70Gain on land sale(12.2)(.1)%—(4.6)(7.6)(.03)Equity method investment impairment charge—— %79.5—79.5.36Pension settlement loss(B)—— %—3.96.6.03Tax election benefit—— %—111.4(111.4)(.50)2017 Non-GAAP Measure$1,773.821.7 %$159.6$427.0$1,385.9$6.31Change Non-GAAP Measure$167.7—$43.7($43.7)$258.8$1.14% Change Non-GAAP Measure9% 27%(10)%19%18%34Table of Contents Continuing Operations OperatingIncomeOperatingMargin(A)Equity Affiliates' IncomeIncome Tax ProvisionNetIncomeDilutedEPS2017 GAAP$1,440.017.6 %$80.1$260.9$1,134.4$5.162016 GAAP1,535.120.5 %147.0432.61,099.55.04Change GAAP($95.1)(290)bp($66.9)($171.7)$34.9$.12% Change GAAP(6)% (46)%(40)%3%2%2017 GAAP$1,440.017.6 %$80.1$260.9$1,134.4$5.16Business separation costs32.5.4 %—3.726.5.12Tax benefit associated with business separation—— %—5.5(5.5)(.02)Cost reduction and asset actions(C)151.41.8 %—41.6109.3.49Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge(D)162.12.0 %—4.6154.1.70Gain on land sale(12.2)(.1)%—(4.6)(7.6)(.03)Equity method investment impairment charge—— %79.5—79.5.36Pension settlement loss(B)—— %—3.96.6.03Tax election benefit—— %—111.4(111.4)(.50)2017 Non-GAAP Measure$1,773.821.7 %$159.6$427.0$1,385.9$6.312016 GAAP$1,535.120.5 %$147.0$432.6$1,099.5$5.04Business separation costs50.6.7 %—3.946.7.21Tax costs associated with business separation—— %—(51.8)51.8.24Cost reduction and asset actions34.5.4 %—9.824.7.11Pension settlement loss(B)—— %—1.83.3.02Loss on extinguishment of debt(E)—— %—2.64.3.022016 Non-GAAP Measure$1,620.221.6 %$147.0$398.9$1,230.3$5.64Change Non-GAAP Measure$153.610bp$12.6$28.1$155.6$.67% Change Non-GAAP Measure9 % 9 %7 %13%12%(A) Operating margin is calculated by dividing operating income by sales.(B) Reflected on the consolidated income statements in ""Other non-operating income (expense), net.""

We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operating and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.As of 30 September 2018, we had $995.1 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $2,791.3. As a result of the Tax Act, we currently do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to U.S. income tax upon subsequent repatriation to the United States. Depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the U.S. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, for additional information. Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:Cash provided by (used for) 2018 2017 2016Operating activities $2,554.7 $2,534.1 $2,258.8Investing activities (1,649.1) (1,417.7) (864.8)Financing activities (1,359.8) (2,040.9) (860.2)Operating ActivitiesFor the year ended 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $2,554.7. Income from continuing operations of $1,455.6 was adjusted for items including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, impacts from the Tax Act, undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, share-based compensation, and noncurrent capital lease receivables. Other adjustments of $131.6 include a $54.9 net impact from the remeasurement of intercompany transactions. The related hedging instruments that eliminate the earnings impact are included as a working capital adjustment in other receivables or payables and accrued liabilities. In addition, other adjustments were impacted by cash received from the early termination of a cross currency swap of $54.4, as well as the excess of pension expense over pension contributions of $23.5. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $265.4, primarily driven by payables and accrued liabilities, inventories, and trade receivables, partially offset by other receivables. The use of cash in payables and accrued liabilities of $277.7 includes a decrease in customer advances of $145.7 primarily related to sale of equipment activity and $67.1 for maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures. The use of cash in inventories primarily resulted from the purchase of helium molecules. In addition, inventories reflect the noncash impact of our change in accounting for U.S. inventories from LIFO to FIFO. The source of cash from other receivables of $123.6 was primarily due to the maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposuresFor the year ended 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $2,534.1. Income from continuing operations of $1,134.4 included a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $162.1, an equity method investment impairment charge of $79.5, and a write-down of long-lived assets associated with restructuring of $69.2. Refer to Note 5, Cost Reduction and Asset Actions; Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates; Note 10, Goodwill; and Note 11, Intangible Assets, of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these charges. Other adjustments of $165.4 included changes in uncertain tax positions and the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that hedge intercompany loans as well as pension contributions and expense. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $48.0 that were primarily driven by payables and accrued liabilities and other receivables, partially offset by other working capital and trade receivables. The increase in payables and accrued liabilities of $163.8 was primarily due to timing differences related to payables and accrued liabilities and an increase in customer advances of $52.8 primarily related to sale of equipment activity. The source of cash from other receivables of $124.7 was primarily due to the maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures. Other working capital was a use of cash of $154.0, primarily driven by payments for income taxes. Trade receivables was a use of cash of $73.6 which is primarily due to timing differences.40Table of ContentsFor the year ended 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $2,258.8. Income from continuing operations of $1,099.5 included a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.9. Other adjustments of $156.7 were primarily driven by the remeasurement of intercompany transactions as the related hedging instruments that eliminate the earnings impact are included in other receivables and payables and accrued liabilities. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $21.2 that were primarily driven by payables and accrued liabilities and inventory partially offset by trade receivables and other working capital. The increase in payables and accrued liabilities of $60.1 was primarily related to an increase in customer advances which includes payment from our joint venture in Jazan, Saudi Arabia and was partially offset by the changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that hedge intercompany loans. The use of cash from other working capital of $47.8 was primarily driven by advances associated with the purchase of helium partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes, including the impacts of higher income. Investing ActivitiesFor the year ended 30 September 2018, cash used for investing activities was $1,649.1. Capital expenditures for plant and equipment was $1,568.4. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $345.4. Refer to Note 6,Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Purchases of investments of $530.3 include short-term instruments with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year. Proceeds from investments of $748.2 resulted from maturities of short-term instruments with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year.For the year ended 30 September 2017, cash used for investing activities was $1,417.7. Capital expenditures for plant and equipment was $1,039.7. Purchases of investments of $2,692.6 exceeded our proceeds from investments of $2,290.7.For the year ended 30 September 2016, cash used for investing activities was $864.8, driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment of $907.7. Proceeds from the sale of assets and investments of $44.6 was primarily driven by the receipt of $30.0 for our rights to a corporate aircraft that was under construction. Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 201820172016Additions to plant and equipment$1,568.4$1,039.7$907.7Acquisitions, less cash acquired345.48.2—Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates—8.1—Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis$1,913.8$1,056.0$907.7Capital lease expenditures(A)20.29.927.2Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis$1,934.0$1,065.9$934.9(A) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows within ""Cash Provided by Operating Activities"" if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in fiscal year 2018 totaled $1,913.8, compared to $1,056.0 in fiscal year 2017. The increase of $857.8 was primarily due to major project spending and higher business combination activity, including the purchase of gasification and syngas clean up assets from Lu'An. Refer to Note 6, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in fiscal year 2018 totaled $1,934.0 compared to $1,065.9 in fiscal year 2017. The increase of $868.1 was primarily due to higher major project spending and higher business combination activity. 41Table of ContentsOn 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture. During 2016, we recorded a noncash transaction of $26.9 to our investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates to increase our obligation to invest in the joint venture to $94.4. This noncash transaction was excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows. We expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. Sales backlog represents our estimate of revenue to be recognized in the future on our share of Air Products’ sale of equipment orders and related process technologies that are under firm contracts. The sales backlog for the Company at 30 September 2018 was $204 compared to $481 at 30 September 2017. 2019 OutlookCapital expenditures for new plant and equipment in fiscal year 2019 are expected to be approximately $2,300 to $2,500. A majority of the total capital expenditures are expected to be for new plants that are currently under construction or expected to start construction. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisitions of small and medium size industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; the purchase of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and investment in very large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.Financing ActivitiesFor the year ended 2018, cash used for financing activities was $1,359.8. This consisted primarily of dividend payments to shareholders of $897.8 and payments on long-term debt of $418.7. Payments on long-term debt primarily related to the repayment of a 1.2% U.S. Senior Note of $400.0 that matured on 16 October 2017. For the year ended 2017, cash used for financing activities was $2,040.9. This consisted primarily of repayments of commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $798.6, dividend payments to shareholders of $787.9 and payments on long-term debt of $483.9. Payments on long-term debt primarily consisted of the repayment of a 4.625% Eurobond of €300 million ($317.2) that matured on 15 March 2017 and $138.0 for the repayment of industrial revenue bonds.For the year ended 2016, cash used for financing activities was $860.2. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net use of cash of $237.7 and included the repayment of the 2.0% Senior Note of $350.0 million on 2 August 2016, and a $144.2 use of cash for net commercial paper and other short-term debt borrowings which were partially offset by debt proceeds from the issuance of a .375% Eurobond of €350 million ($386.9) on 1 June 2016. Versum distributed in-kind notes with an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 to Air Products. However, since Air Products exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for $418.3 of Air Products’ outstanding commercial paper, this noncash debt for debt exchange was excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note 4, Materials Technologies Separation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We also used cash to pay dividends of $721.2 and received proceeds from stock option exercises of $141.3. Discontinued OperationsFor the year ended 2018, cash flows of discontinued operations were not material.For the year ended 2017, cash flows of discontinued operations primarily included impacts associated with the spin-off of EMD as Versum on 1 October 2016 and the sale of PMD to Evonik on 3 January 2017. Cash used for operating activities of $966.2 was primarily driven by taxes paid on the gain on the sale of PMD. Cash provided by investing activities of $3,750.6 primarily resulted from the proceeds on the sale of PMD. Cash provided by financing activities resulted from a $69.5 receipt of cash from Versum related to finalization of the spin-off. For the year ended 2016, discontinued operations primarily includes the Energy-from-Waste business, which the Company decided to exit in the second quarter of 2016, and the Materials Technologies business which contained two divisions, EMD and PMD. Cash provided by discontinued operations was $753.6 primarily driven by income from operations of discontinued operations, which excludes the noncash impairment charge, of $386.1 and long-term debt proceeds from Versum's Term Loan B of $575.0, partially offset by capital expenditures for plant and equipment of $245.1. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 42Table of ContentsFinancing and Capital StructureCapital needs in fiscal year 2018 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2018, total debt outstanding was $3,812.6 compared to $3,962.8 at the end of 2017, and cash and cash items were $2,791.3 compared to $3,273.6 at the end of 2017. Total debt as of 30 September 2018 includes related party debt of 2.6 billion RMB ($384) associated with the Lu'An joint venture.On 31 March 2017, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement maturing 31 March 2022 with a syndicate of banks (the “2017 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. On 28 September 2018, we amended the 2017 Credit Agreement to reduce the maximum borrowing capacity to $2,300.0. No other terms were impacted by the amendment.The 2017 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. The Company’s only financial covenant under the 2017 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (total debt plus total equity) no greater than 70%. Total debt at 30 September 2018 and 2017 expressed as a percentage of total capitalization was 25.4% and 28.0%, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2018.Commitments totaling $7.0 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, all of which was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2018.As of 30 September 2018, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2018, 2017 or 2016. At 30 September 2018, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.2019 OutlookCash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future and our working capital balance was $2,743.9 at 30 September 2018. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants.DividendsDividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. During 2018, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from $.95 per share to $1.10 per share, or $4.40 per share annually.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSWe are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations on a continuing operations basis as of 30 September 2018: Total20192020202120222023ThereafterDebt maturities$3,774$407$381$474$448$449$1,615Contractual interest on debt58910181715746233Capital leases232231114Operating leases3346650413123123Pension obligations310534041414194Unconditional purchase obligations7,6608513623423183265,461Deemed repatriation tax related to the Tax Act184—14161616122Obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate100—100————Total Contractual Obligations$12,974$1,480$1,030$988$912$902$7,66243Table of ContentsDebt ObligationsOur debt obligations include the maturity payments of the principal amount of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debt obligations.Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had approximately $640 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2018, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2018. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates and by interbank offer rates.LeasesRefer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases.Pension ObligationsThe amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that, in total, equal the recognized pension liabilities for our U.S. and international pension plans. For additional information, refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment.The total accrued liability for pension benefits may be impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions.Unconditional Purchase ObligationsApproximately $6,800 of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium purchases. The majority of these obligations occur after fiscal year 2023. Helium purchases include crude feedstock supply to multiple helium refining plants in North America as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world. As a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain take-if-tendered provisions. The refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas, primarily under medium-term requirements contracts. While contract terms in the energy sector are longer than those in merchant, helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties.Approximately $210 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers.Purchase commitments to spend approximately $455 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2019.We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices.44Table of ContentsIncome Tax LiabilitiesTax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2018 were $233.6. These tax liabilities were excluded from the Contractual Obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. However, the Contractual Obligations table above includes our accrued liability of approximately $184 for deemed repatriation tax that is payable over eight years related to the Tax Act. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Obligation for Future Contribution to an Equity AffiliateOn 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan. In total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. As of 30 September 2018, we recorded a noncurrent liability of $94.4 for our obligation to make future equity contributions in 2020 based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan. Expected Investment in Joint VentureOn 12 August 2018, Air Products entered an agreement to form a gasification/power joint venture (""JV"") with Saudi Aramco and ACWA in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products will own at least 55% of the JV, with Saudi Aramco and ACWA Power owning the balance. The JV will purchase the gasification assets, power block, and the associated utilities from Saudi Aramco for approximately $8 billion. Our expected investment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above pending closing, which is currently expected in fiscal year 2020.The JV will own and operate the facility under a 25-year contract for a fixed monthly fee. Saudi Aramco will supply feedstock to the JV, and the JV will produce power, hydrogen and other utilities for Saudi Aramco. PENSION BENEFITSThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.The fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2018 measurement date decreased to $4,273.1 from $4,409.2 at the end of fiscal year 2017. The projected benefit obligation for these plans was $4,583.3 and $5,107.2 at the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net unfunded liability decreased $387.8 from $698.0 to $310.2, primarily due to higher discount rates and favorable asset experience. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits.Pension Expense 201820172016Pension expense – Continuing operations$91.8$72.0$55.8Settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments (included above)48.915.06.0Weighted average discount rate – Service cost3.2%2.9%4.1%Weighted average discount rate – Interest cost 2.9%2.5%3.4%Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets6.9%7.4%7.5%Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase3.5%3.5%3.5%45Table of Contents2018 vs. 2017 Pension expense, excluding settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments (""special items""), decreased from the prior year primarily due to recognition of favorable asset experience, partially offset by lower expected returns on assets. In fiscal year 2018, special items of $48.9 included a pension settlement loss of $43.7 primarily resulting from the transfer of certain U.S. pension payment obligations to an insurer during the fourth quarter, $4.8 of pension settlement losses related to lump sum payouts from the U.S. Supplemental Pension Plan, and $.4 of termination benefits, all of which are reflected in ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on the consolidated income statements. 2017 vs. 2016Pension expense, excluding special items, increased from fiscal year 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate offset by favorable asset experience. Special items of $15.0 included pension settlement losses of $10.5 related to the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan, as well as curtailment and termination benefits of $4.5.2019 OutlookIn fiscal year 2019, pension expense, excluding special items, is expected to be approximately $20 to $30. This results from lower loss amortization primarily due to favorable asset experience and the impact of higher discount rates, partially offset by lower expected returns on assets. Pension settlement losses of $10 to $15 are expected, depending on the timing of retirements. In fiscal year 2019, we expect pension expense to include approximately $75 for amortization of actuarial losses. In fiscal year 2018, pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $128. Net actuarial gains of $232 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2018. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2019.Subsequent Event – GMP Equalization On 26 October 2018, the United Kingdom High Court issued a ruling in a case relating to equalization of pension plan participants’ benefits for the gender effects of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (""GMP equalization""). The ruling relates to the Lloyds Banking Group pension plans but impacts other U.K. defined benefit pension plans. We are still assessing the impact of this ruling. If we determine that the ruling impacts our U.K. pension plan, the approach to achieve GMP equalization may retroactively increase our benefit obligation for some participants in the plan and may impact funding requirements. Pension FundingPension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2018 and 2017, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $68.3 and $64.1, respectively.For fiscal year 2019, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $45 to $65. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on pages 43-44 for a projection of future contributions.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.46Table of ContentsThe amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $12.8, $11.4, and $12.2 in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $3, $7, and $3 in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately $4 in both fiscal years 2019 and 2020.We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $76 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $90 as of 30 September 2018. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2018 and 2017 included an accrual of $76.8 and $83.6, respectively, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities. The accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and Pasadena, Texas, locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities.Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year.Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (""GHG""), including carbon dioxide. These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading system, the California cap and trade schemes, Alberta’s Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation, China’s Emission Trading Scheme, South Korea’s Emission Trading Scheme, nation-wide expansion of the China Emission Trading Scheme, revisions to the Alberta regulation, and Environment Canada's developing Output Based Pricing System. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs. Increased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and hydrogen production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We also have developed a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from steam methane reforming, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.47Table of ContentsRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSWe have related party sales to some of our equity affiliates and joint venture partners. Sales to related parties totaled approximately $340, $580, and $320 during fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and primarily related to Jazan sale of equipment activity. Agreements with related parties include terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party.In addition, we completed the formation of Air Products Lu An (Changzhi) Co., Ltd., a 60%-owned JV with Lu'An Clean Energy Company (""Lu'An""), and the JV acquired gasification and syngas clean-up assets from Lu'An during the third quarter of 2018. In connection with the acquisition, Lu'An made a loan of 2.6 billion RMB to the JV, and we established a liability of 2.3 billion RMB for cash payments expected to be made to or on behalf of Lu'An in fiscal year 2019. As of 30 September 2018, long-term debt payable to Lu'An of 2.6 billion RMB ($384) is presented on the consolidated balance sheets as ""Long-term debt – related party,"" and our expected remaining cash payments of approximately 2.2 billion RMB ($330) are presented within ""Payables and accrued liabilities.""INFLATIONWe operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESNote 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee.Depreciable Lives of Plant and EquipmentNet plant and equipment at 30 September 2018 totaled $9,923.7, and depreciation expense totaled $940.7 during fiscal year 2018. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.The regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.Our regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts aregenerally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. 48Table of ContentsIn addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on our historical experience with similar assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional Industrial Gases segments would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease LifeBy 1 Year Increase LifeBy 1 YearIndustrial Gases – Regional $45 ($39)Impairment of AssetsPlant and EquipmentPlant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.In fiscal year 2018, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset groupings may not be recoverable.In fiscal year 2017, we performed interim impairment testing of our Latin America reporting unit (LASA) long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, as of 30 June 2017. See the 2017 Impairment Testing discussions under the Goodwill and Intangible Assets sections below. We also tested the recoverability of LASA's long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, and concluded that they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows. In fiscal year 2016, the Board of Directors approved the Company’s exit of its EfW business. We assessed the recoverability of capital costs for the two projects associated with this business and recorded an impairment charge of $913.5 to reduce the carrying values of plant assets to their estimated net realizable value. We estimated the net realizable value of the projects assuming an orderly liquidation of assets capable of being marketed on a secondary equipment market based on market quotes and our experience with selling similar equipment. An asset’s orderly liquidation value is the amount that could be realized from a liquidation sale, given a reasonable period of time to find a buyer, selling the asset in the existing condition where it is located, and assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. The loss was measured as the difference between the orderly liquidation value of the assets and the net book value of the assets. The loss was recorded in the results of discontinued operations.49Table of ContentsDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we recorded an additional loss of $6.3 to update our estimate of the net realizable value of the plant assets. The loss was recorded in the results of discontinued operations. In fiscal year 2017, we also recorded a charge of $45.7 to write-down the air separation unit in the Industrials Gases – EMEA segment that was constructed mainly to provide oxygen to one of the EfW plants to its net realizable value of $1.4. The charge was recorded in the results of continuing operations. The remaining assets associated with EfW were liquidated during fiscal year 2018 with no value remaining as of 30 September 2018.Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, and Note 5, Cost Reduction and Asset Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.GoodwillThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $788.9 as of 30 September 2018. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five business segments that are comprised of ten reporting units within seven operating segments. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, for additional information. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional Industrial Gases segments.As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. We choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.50Table of Contents2018 Impairment TestingDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test. We determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except LASA, for which the fair value exceeded the carrying value by 8%.The excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units other than LASA ranged from approximately 110% to approximately 280%. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of these reporting units. In this scenario, the fair value of our reporting units other than LASA continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 90% to 240%.As of 30 September 2018, the carrying value of LASA goodwill was $65.6, or less than 1% of consolidated total assets. Further events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to a decline in market share, pricing pressures, and further economic weakening in the markets we serve. Revenue growth and EBITDA margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value of LASA. We determined that, with other assumptions held constant, a decrease in revenue rates of approximately 230 basis points or a decrease in EBITDA margin of approximately 210 basis points would result in an impairment of the remaining goodwill balance. The carrying value of LASA's other material assets at 30 September 2018 included: Plant and equipment, net of $341.1; customer relationships of $152.1; and trade names and trademarks of $48.4. The trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.2017 Impairment TestingFor the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, volumes declined in our LASA reporting unit, and overall revenue growth did not meet expectations. Due to weak economic conditions in Latin America and expectations for continued volume weakness in the Latin American countries and markets in which we operate, we lowered our long-term growth projections for LASA by more than 200 basis points, which also unfavorably impacted our EBITDA margin. Management considered the revised projections for LASA to be indicators of potential impairment and, accordingly, performed interim impairment testing of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, as of 30 June 2017 utilizing the revised projections. LASA represented approximately 6% of the Company’s total revenue in 2017 with business units in Chile, Colombia, and other Latin America countries. We estimated the fair value of LASA as of 30 June 2017 based on two valuation approaches, the income approach and the market approach, as described above. We reviewed relevant facts and circumstances in determining the weighting of the approaches. Under the income approach, we estimated the fair value of LASA based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, taking into consideration business and market conditions for the Latin American countries and markets in which we operate. These estimates were consistent with our revised forecast and long-term financial planning processes, which included a reduction in sales growth by more than 200 basis points from that previously identified. We calculated the discount rate based on a market-participant, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which considers industry-specific rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure, adjusted for risks associated with business size and geography. Under the market approach, we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publicly-traded industrial gases companies and regional manufacturing companies, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects.Based on the results of the valuations, we determined that the goodwill associated with LASA was impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of $145.3, the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, during the third quarter of 2017. This impairment is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge.” This charge was not deductible for tax purposes and is excluded from segment operating income.51Table of ContentsIntangible AssetsIntangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 September 2018 totaled $387.3 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined.Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2018 totaled $51.2 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.Disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 11, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements.2018 Impairment TestingIn the fourth quarter of 2018, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles which resulted in no impairment.2017 Impairment TestingDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we conducted an interim impairment test of the indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with LASA. We determined that the carrying value of trade names and trademarks was in excess of fair value, and as a result, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $16.8 to reduce these indefinite-lived intangible assets to their fair value. This impairment charge has been excluded from segment operating income and is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge.""Equity InvestmentsInvestments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,277.2 at 30 September 2018. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.An impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of an investment occurs. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. We utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach. For the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co., Ltd. (AHG), a 25%‑owned equity affiliate in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment, completed a review of its business plan and outlook. As a result of the revised business plan, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in AHG and recorded a noncash impairment charge of $79.5 to reduce the carrying value of our investment. The impairment charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “Equity affiliates' income.” This charge was not deductible for tax purposes and has been excluded from segment results. The decline in value resulted from expectations for lower future cash flows to be generated by AHG, primarily due to challenging economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, including the impacts of lower prices in the oil and gas industry, increased competition, and capital project growth opportunities not materializing as anticipated.52Table of ContentsThe AHG investment was valued based on the results of the income and market valuation approaches. The income approach utilized a discount rate based on a market-participant, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which considers industry required rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure adjusted for risks associated with size and geography. Other significant estimates and assumptions that drove our updated valuation of AHG included revenue growth rates and profit margins that were lower than those upon acquisition and our assessment of AHG's business improvement plan effectiveness. Under the market approach, we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publicly-traded industrial gases companies engaged in similar lines of business, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects.Revenue Recognition – Percentage-of-Completion MethodRevenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, revenue from the sale of major equipment, such as LNG heat exchangers and large air separation units, is primarily recognized based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs to be incurred. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete the contract and recognize the profit over the life of the contract.Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule and technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.In addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities, our Jazan large air separation unit sale of equipment project within our Industrial Gases – Global segment requires monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, including the Jazan project, favorably impacted operating income by approximately $38, $27, and $20 in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years. We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. At 30 September 2018, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded in noncurrent, was $244.0 and net deferred tax liabilities was $653.7. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2018 were $233.6, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2018 was $524.3 and includes a discrete net income tax expense of $180.6 related to the Tax Act. The net expense was recorded based on provisional estimates pursuant to the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Subsequent adjustments, if any, will be accounted for in the period such adjustments are identified. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.53Table of ContentsDeferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $20.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans.Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $32 per year.The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $21 per year.We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. For equities, this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $11 per year.54Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the Company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount withinthis range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCESee Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter intotransactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current and related party portions), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. At 30 September 2018 and 2017, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $3,736.2 and $3,832.3, respectively.The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date.55Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur debt portfolio as of 30 September 2018, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 66% fixed-rate debt and 34% variable-rate debt. Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2017, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 65% fixed-rate debt and 35% variable-rate debt.The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2018, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $96 and $112 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2018 and 2017, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $101 and $119 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2018 and 2017, respectively.Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $13 and $14 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2018 and 2017, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $13 and $14 per year at 30 September 2018 and 2017, respectively.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2018 and 2017, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $329 and $312 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2018 and 2017, respectively.The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.The majority of the Company’s sales are derived from outside of the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. Financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $30 and $25, respectively.56Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:33.317210

Focused on serving energy, environment and emerging markets, the Company provides essential industrial gases, related equipment and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemical, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. Air Products is also the global leader in the supply of liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") process technology and equipment. The Company also develops, engineers, builds, owns and operates some of the world's largest industrial gas projects, including gasification projects that sustainably convert abundant natural resources into syngas for the production of high-value power, fuels and chemicals. With operations in 51 countries outside the United States, in fiscal year 2019 we had sales of $8.9 billion, assets of $18.9 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 17,700 full- and part-time employees.As of 30 September 2019, our operations were organized into five reportable business segments:•Industrial Gases – Americas;•Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa);•Industrial Gases – Asia;•Industrial Gases – Global; and•Corporate and otherThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis discusses our results based on these operations. Refer to Note 26, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.2019 IN SUMMARYIn fiscal year 2019, we remained focused on improving our existing business while deploying capital into larger, more complex industrial gas projects. We continued to execute our gasification strategy, with the Lu'An project in China reaching its first full year of operation and the progression of other projects such as the Jiutai coal-to-syngas project and the Debang syngas project. We also received a number of important recognitions for our strong focus on sustainability and our commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion. The results below are compared to fiscal year 2018.•Sales of $8,918.9 were flat as favorable pricing of 3% and higher volumes of 2% were offset by negative currency impacts of 3% and the negative impact of a contract modification to a tolling arrangement in India of 2%.•Operating income of $2,144.4 increased 9%, or $178.8, and operating margin of 24.0% increased 200 bp.•Net income of $1,809.4 increased 18%, or $276.5, and net income margin of 20.3% increased 310 bp.•Adjusted EBITDA of $3,468.0 increased 11%, or $352.5, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.9% increased 400 bp.•Diluted EPS of $7.94 increased 20%, or $1.35 per share. Adjusted diluted EPS of $8.21 increased 10%, or $.76 per share. A summary table of changes in diluted EPS is presented on the following page.•We increased our quarterly dividend by 5% from $1.10 to $1.16 per share, or $4.64 per share annually. This is the 37th consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment, reflecting continued confidence in our financial strength, significant cash flows, and growth outlook. 21Table of ContentsChanges in Diluted EPS Attributable to Air Products Increase 20192018(Decrease)Diluted EPS$7.94$6.59$1.35Operating Income Impact (after-tax) Underlying business Volume $.40Price, net of variable costs .81Other costs (.17)Currency (.20)Facility closure (.10)Change in inventory valuation method (.08)Cost reduction actions (.08)Gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments .13Total Operating Income Impact (after-tax) $.71Other Impact (after-tax) Equity affiliates' income .04Interest expense (.02)Other non-operating income (expense), net .21Change in effective tax rate, excluding discrete items below (.09)Tax reform repatriation 2.22Tax reform adjustment related to deemed foreign dividends (.51)Tax reform rate change and other (.96)Tax restructuring (.16)Noncontrolling interests (.06)Weighted average diluted shares (.03)Total Other Impact (after-tax) $.64Total Change in Diluted EPS $1.35 Increase 20192018(Decrease)Diluted EPS$7.94$6.59$1.35Facility closure.10—.10Change in inventory valuation method—(.08).08Cost reduction actions.08—.08Gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments(.13)—(.13)Pension settlement loss.02.15(.13)Tax reform repatriation(.06)2.16(2.22)Tax reform adjustment related to deemed foreign dividends.26(.25).51Tax reform rate change and other—(.96).96Tax restructuring—(.16).16Adjusted Diluted EPS$8.21$7.45$.7622Table of Contents2020 OUTLOOKIn fiscal year 2020, we intend to grow our earnings by continuing to improve our base businesses and execute against our capital deployment strategy. Backed by our current financial position, we will strive to continue to win and invest in key growth projects, including large gasification projects that are consistent with our onsite business model. We expect earnings to grow from an investment in a new equity affiliate that will acquire the gasification, power, and industrial gas assets at Jazan Economic City, Saudi Arabia (""the Jazan gas and power project"").The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDiscussion of Consolidated Results 20192018$ ChangeChangeGAAP Measures Sales$8,918.9$8,930.2($11.3)—%Operating income2,144.41,965.6178.89%Operating margin24.0%22.0%—200 bpEquity affiliates’ income$215.4$174.8$40.623%Net income1,809.41,532.9276.518%Net income margin20.3%17.2%—310 bpNon-GAAP Measures Adjusted EBITDA$3,468.0$3,115.5$352.511%Adjusted EBITDA margin38.9%34.9%—400 bpSalesSales % Change from Prior Year Volume2 %Price3 %Energy and raw material cost pass-through— %Currency(3)%Other(A)(2)%Total Consolidated Sales Change— %(A) Includes the impact from the modification of a hydrogen supply contract to a tolling arrangement in India in December 2018 (""the India contract modification"").Sales of $8,918.9 were flat as favorable pricing of 3% and higher volumes of 2% were offset by negative currency impacts of 3% and the impact of the India contract modification of 2%. The pricing improvement was primarily attributable to our merchant business across the regional segments. Volumes were higher from new projects, mainly the Lu'An project in Asia, and positive base business growth. These drivers were partially offset by lower Jazan sale of equipment activity, which negatively impacted volumes by 2%, and a prior year equipment sale resulting from a contract termination in Asia. Unfavorable currency impacts were driven by the Chinese Renminbi, Euro, and British Pound Sterling. Energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers was flat versus the prior year.23Table of ContentsCost of Sales and Gross MarginCost of sales, including the facility closure discussed below, was $6,004.5. Total cost of sales decreased 3%, or $185.0, as a favorable impact from the India contract modification of $193 and positive currency impacts of $189 were partially offset by higher other costs of $67, higher costs attributable to sales volumes of $44, higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of $33, the facility closure of $29, and a benefit of $24 for the change in inventory valuation method for our United States industrial gas inventories in the prior year. Gross margin of 32.7% increased 200 bp, primarily due to positive pricing, favorable volume mix, and the India contract modification, partially offset by unfavorable net operating costs.Facility ClosureIn December 2018, one of our customers was subject to a government enforced shutdown due to environmental reasons. As a result, we recognized a charge of $29.0 ($22.1 after-tax, or $.10 per share) during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 primarily related to the write-off of onsite assets. This charge is reflected as “Facility closure” on our consolidated income statements. We do not expect to recognize additional charges related to this shutdown.Selling and Administrative ExpenseSelling and administrative expense of $750.0 decreased 1%, or $10.8. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased from 8.5% to 8.4%.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense of $72.9 increased 13%, or $8.4. Research and development expense as a percent of sales increased to .8% from .7%.Cost Reduction and Asset ActionsIn fiscal year 2019, we recognized an expense of $25.5 ($18.8 after-tax, or $.08 per share) for severance and other benefits associated with position eliminations that are expected to drive cost synergies, primarily within the Industrial Gases – EMEA and the Industrial Gases – Americas segments. This expense has been reflected as ""Cost reduction and asset actions"" on our consolidated income statements.Gain on Exchange of Equity Affiliate InvestmentsIn fiscal year 2019, we recognized a net gain of $29.1 ($.13 per share) resulting from the exchange of two 50%-owned industrial gas joint ventures in China. Refer to Note 7, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The net gain has been reflected as ""Gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments"" on our consolidated income statements. There were no tax impacts on the exchange.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net of $49.3 decreased 2%, or $.9, primarily due to lower income from transition services agreements, mostly offset by income from the sale of assets and investments and a favorable foreign exchange impact.Operating Income and MarginOperating income of $2,144.4 increased 9%, or $178.8, as positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $220, favorable volumes of $110, and a gain on the exchange of two 50%-owned equity affiliates of $29 were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of $55, higher net operating costs of $46, a charge for a facility closure of $29, a charge for cost reduction actions of $26, and the impact of the change in inventory valuation method of $24 in the prior year. Operating margin of 24.0% increased 200 bp, primarily due to positive pricing and favorable volume mix, partially offset by unfavorable net operating costs.Equity Affiliates’ IncomeIncome from equity affiliates of $215.4 increased 23%, or $40.6, primarily due to an expense of $28.5 in the prior year resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, favorable volumes, and new plant contributions. For additional information on the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.24Table of ContentsInterest Expense 20192018Interest incurred$150.5$150.0Less: Capitalized interest13.519.5Interest Expense$137.0$130.5Interest incurred increased $.5 as interest expense associated with financing the Lu'An joint venture was mostly offset by favorable impacts from currency, a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio, and a lower average debt balance. Capitalized interest decreased 31%, or $6.0, due to a decrease in the carrying value of projects under construction, primarily driven by the Lu'An project in Asia.Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), NetOther non-operating income (expense), net of $66.7 increased $61.6, primarily due to lower pension settlement losses, higher non-service pension income, and higher interest income on cash and cash items. The prior year included pension settlement losses of $43.7 ($33.2 after-tax, or $.15 per share) primarily in connection with the transfer of certain pension assets and payment obligations to an insurer for our U.S. salaried and hourly plans. In fiscal year 2019, we recognized a pension settlement loss of $5.0 ($3.8 after-tax, or $.02 per share) associated with the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan during the second quarter. Net Income and Net Income MarginNet income of $1,809.4 increased 18%, or $276.5, primarily due to impacts from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, positive pricing, and favorable volumes. Net income margin of 20.3% increased 310 bp.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginAdjusted EBITDA of $3,468.0 increased 11%, or $352.5, primarily due to positive pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by unfavorable currency. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.9% increased 400 bp, primarily due to higher volumes, positive pricing, and the India contract modification. The India contract modification contributed 80 bp.Effective Tax RateThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. The effective tax rate was 21.0% and 26.0% in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.The current year rate was lower primarily due to impacts related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act"") in 2018, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as other changes. As a result of the Tax Act, our income tax provision reflects discrete net income tax costs of $43.8 and $180.6 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The current year included a cost of $56.2 ($.26 per share) for the reversal of a benefit recorded in 2018 related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends. We recorded this reversal based on regulations issued in 2019. The 2019 reversal was partially offset by a favorable adjustment of $12.4 ($.06 per share) that was recorded as we completed our estimates of the impacts of the Tax Act. This adjustment is primarily related to foreign tax items, including the deemed repatriation tax for foreign tax redeterminations. In addition, the current year rate included a net gain on the exchange of two equity affiliates of $29.1, which was not a taxable transaction. The higher 2018 expense resulting from the Tax Act was partially offset by a $35.7 tax benefit from the restructuring of foreign subsidiaries, a $9.1 benefit from a foreign audit settlement agreement, and higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.The adjusted effective tax rate was 19.4% and 18.6% in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The lower prior year rate was primarily due to the $9.1 benefit from a foreign audit settlement agreement and higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.25Table of ContentsRefer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Discontinued OperationsIn fiscal year 2018, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $42.2 included an income tax benefit of $25.6 resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions taken in conjunction with the disposition of our former European Homecare business in fiscal year 2012. In addition, we recorded an after-tax benefit of $17.6 resulting from the resolution of certain post-closing adjustments associated with the sale of our former Performance Materials Division. These benefits were partially offset by an after-tax loss of $1.0 related to Energy-from-Waste.Segment AnalysisIndustrial Gases – Americas 20192018$ ChangeChangeSales$3,873.5$3,758.8$114.73%Operating income997.7927.969.88%Operating margin25.8%24.7%—110 bpEquity affiliates’ income$84.8$82.0$2.83%Adjusted EBITDA1,587.71,495.292.56%Adjusted EBITDA margin41.0%39.8%—120 bpSales % Change from Prior Year Volume1 %Price3 %Energy and natural gas cost pass-through— %Currency(1)%Total Industrial Gases – Americas Sales Change3 %Sales of $3,873.5 increased 3%, or $114.7, as positive pricing of 3% and higher volumes of 1% were partially offset by a negative impact from currency of 1%.

On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted effective tax rate. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, which are presented above, we also include certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are presented below to help the reader understand the impact that our non-GAAP adjustments have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present below a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP"").The Company's non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's historical financial performance and projected future results. In many cases, non-GAAP measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude certain disclosed items, or “non-GAAP adjustments,” that the Company believes are not representative of underlying business performance. For example, the Company previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that the Company may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.The tax impact on our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of the transactions. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.29Table of ContentsConsolidated ResultsThe tables below provide a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS, which the Company views as a key performance metric. We believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of our non-GAAP adjustments as management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. The measures presented are based on continuing operations.

Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance. Margin is calculated for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period. Below is a presentation of consolidated sales and a reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to adjusted EBITDA and net income margin on a GAAP basis to adjusted EBITDA margin: 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015Sales$8,918.9 $8,930.2 $8,187.6 $7,503.7 $7,824.3 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 $Margin $Margin $Margin $Margin $MarginNet income and net income margin$1,809.420.3% $1,532.917.2% $3,021.236.9% $661.58.8 % $1,317.616.8 %Less: Income (Loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax——% 42.2.5% 1,866.022.8% (460.5)(6.1)% 351.74.5 %Add: Interest expense137.01.5% 130.51.5% 120.61.5% 115.21.5 % 102.81.3 %Less: Other non-operating income (expense), net66.7.7% 5.1.1% 16.6.2% (5.4)(.1)% (42.3)(.5)%Add: Income tax provision480.15.4% 524.35.9% 260.93.2% 432.65.8 % 300.23.8 %Add: Depreciation and amortization1,082.812.1% 970.710.9% 865.810.6% 854.611.4 % 858.511.0 %Less: Change in inventory valuation method——% 24.1.3% ——% —— % —— %Add: Facility closure29.0.3% ——% ——% —— % —— %Add: Business separation costs——% ——% 32.5.4% 50.6.7 % 7.5.1 %Add: Business restructuring, cost reduction, and asset actions25.5.3% ——% 151.41.8% 34.5.4 % 180.12.4 %Add: Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge——% ——% 162.12.0% —— % —— %Less: Gain on previously held equity interest——% ——% ——% —— % 17.9.2 %Less: Gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments29.1.3% ——% ——% —— % —— %Less: Gain on land sales——% ——% 12.2.2% —— % 33.6.4 %Add: Equity method investment impairment charge——% ——% 79.51.0% —— % —— %Add: Loss on extinguishment of debt——% ——% ——% 6.9.1 % 16.6.2 %Add: Tax reform repatriation - equity method investment——% 28.5.3% ——% —— % —— %Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin$3,468.038.9% $3,115.534.9% $2,799.234.2% $2,621.834.9% $2,422.431.0% 2019 2018 2017 2016 Change GAAP Net income $ change $276.5 ($1,488.3) $2,359.7 ($656.1) Net income % change 18% (49)% 357% (50)% Net income margin change 310 bp (1,970) bp 2,810 bp (800) bp Change Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $ change $352.5 $316.3 $177.4 $199.4 Adjusted EBITDA % change 11% 11 % 7% 8 % Adjusted EBITDA margin change 400 bp 70 bp (70) bp 390 bp 31Table of ContentsBelow is reconciliation of operating income and operating margin by segment to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin by segment: IndustrialGases–AmericasIndustrialGases–EMEAIndustrialGases–AsiaIndustrialGases–GlobalCorporateand otherTotal GAAP Measure Twelve Months Ended 30 September 2019 Operating income (loss)$997.7$472.4$864.2($11.7)($152.8)$2,169.8(A) Operating margin25.8%23.6%32.4% Twelve Months Ended 30 September 2018 Operating income (loss)$927.9$445.8$689.9$53.9($176.0)$1,941.5(A) Operating margin24.7%20.3%28.1% 2019 vs. 2018 Operating income (loss) change$69.8$26.6$174.3($65.6)$23.2 Operating income (loss) % change8%6%25%(122)%13% Operating margin change110 bp330 bp430 bp IndustrialGases–AmericasIndustrialGases–EMEAIndustrialGases–AsiaIndustrialGases–GlobalCorporateand otherTotal Non-GAAP Measure Twelve Months Ended 30 September 2019 Operating income (loss)$997.7$472.4$864.2($11.7)($152.8)$2,169.8(A) Add: Depreciation and amortization505.2189.5361.58.618.01,082.8 Add: Equity affiliates' income84.869.058.43.2—215.4(B) Adjusted EBITDA$1,587.7$730.9$1,284.1$.1($134.8)$3,468.0 Adjusted EBITDA margin41.0%36.5%48.2% Twelve Months Ended 30 September 2018 Operating income (loss)$927.9$445.8$689.9$53.9($176.0)$1,941.5(A) Add: Depreciation and amortization485.3198.6265.88.112.9970.7 Add: Equity affiliates' income82.061.158.31.9—203.3(B) Adjusted EBITDA$1,495.2$705.5$1,014.0$63.9($163.1)$3,115.5 Adjusted EBITDA margin39.8%32.2%41.3% 2019 vs. 2018 Adjusted EBITDA change$92.5$25.4$270.1($63.8)$28.3 Adjusted EBITDA % change6%4%27%(100)%17% Adjusted EBITDA margin change120 bp430 bp690 bp (A) The table below reconciles operating income as reflected on our consolidated income statements to total operating income in the table above:Operating Income20192018 Consolidated operating income$2,144.4$1,965.6 Change in inventory valuation method—(24.1) Facility closure29.0— Cost reduction and asset actions25.5— Gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments(29.1)— Total$2,169.8$1,941.5 32Table of Contents(B) The table below reconciles equity affiliates' income as reflected on our consolidated income statements to total equity affiliates' income in the table above:Equity Affiliates' Income20192018 Consolidated equity affiliates' income$215.4$174.8 Tax reform repatriation - equity method investment—28.5 Total$215.4$203.3 Income TaxesThe tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense associated with each adjustment and is primarily dependent upon the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.

As of 30 September 2019, our consolidated balance sheet included cash and cash items of $2,248.7. We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operating and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.As of 30 September 2019, we had $971.5 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $2,248.7. As a result of the Tax Act, we do not expect that a significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries' and affiliates' earnings will be subject to U.S. income tax upon subsequent repatriation to the United States. The repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside. However, because we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the U.S. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, for additional information. The table below summarizes our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities from continuing operations as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows:Cash Provided by (Used for)20192018Operating activities$2,969.9$2,547.2Investing activities(2,113.4)(1,641.6)Financing activities(1,370.5)(1,359.8)Operating ActivitiesFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $2,969.9. Income from continuing operations of $1,760.0 was adjusted for items including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, impacts from the Tax Act, a charge for the facility closure of one of our customers, undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, gain on sale of assets and investments, share-based compensation, noncurrent capital lease receivables, and certain other adjustments. The caption ""Gain on sale of assets and investments"" includes a gain of $14.1 recognized on the disposition of our interest in High-Tech Gases (Beijing) Co., Ltd., a previously held equity investment in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment. Refer to Note 7, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $25.3, primarily driven by $69.0 from trade receivables and $41.8 from payables and accrued liabilities, partially offset by $79.8 from other receivables. The use of cash within ""Payables and accrued liabilities"" was primarily driven by a $48.9 decrease in accrued utilities and a $30.3 decrease in accrued interest, partially offset by a $51.6 increase in customer advances primarily related to sale of equipment activity. The decrease in accrued utilities was primarily driven by a contract modification to a tolling arrangement in India and lower utility costs in the Industrial Gases – Americas segment. The source of cash from other receivables of $79.8 was primarily due to the maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures and the collection of value added taxes.For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $2,547.2, including income from continuing operations of $1,455.6. Other adjustments of $131.6 include a $54.9 net impact from the remeasurement of intercompany transactions. The related hedging instruments that eliminate the earnings impact are included as a working capital adjustment in other receivables or payables and accrued liabilities. In addition, other adjustments were impacted by cash received from the early termination of a cross currency swap of $54.4, as well as the excess of pension expense over pension contributions of $23.5. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $265.4, primarily driven by payables and accrued liabilities, inventories, and trade receivables, partially offset by other receivables. The use of cash in payables and accrued liabilities of $277.7 includes a decrease in customer advances of $145.7 primarily related to sale of equipment activity and $67.1 for maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures. The use of cash in inventories primarily resulted from the purchase of helium molecules. In addition, inventories reflect the noncash impact of our change in accounting for U.S. inventories from LIFO to FIFO. The source of cash from other receivables of $128.3 was primarily due to the maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures.34Table of ContentsInvesting ActivitiesFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019, cash used for investing activities was $2,113.4. Payments for additions to plant and equipment totaled $1,989.7. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $123.2. Refer to Note 7, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Proceeds from investments of $190.5 resulting from maturities of short-term instruments with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year exceeded purchase of $172.1.For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2018, cash used for investing activities was $1,641.6. Payments for additions to plant and equipment totaled $1,568.4. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $345.4. Refer to Note 7, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Proceeds from investments of $748.2 exceeded our purchases of investments of $530.3. Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures is a non-GAAP measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. A reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below: 20192018Cash used for investing activities$2,113.4$1,641.6Proceeds from sale of assets and investments11.148.8Purchases of investments(172.1)(530.3)Proceeds from investments190.5748.2Other investing activities(14.3)5.5Capital Expenditures$2,128.6$1,913.8The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below: 20192018Additions to plant and equipment$1,989.7$1,568.4Acquisitions, less cash acquired123.2345.4Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates15.7—Capital Expenditures$2,128.6$1,913.8Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2019 totaled $2,128.6 compared to $1,913.8 in fiscal year 2018. The increase of $214.8 was primarily due to major project spending, including payment for gasification and syngas clean up assets from Lu'An. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. 2020 Outlook for Investing ActivitiesCapital expenditures in fiscal year 2020 are expected to be approximately $4 billion to $4.5 billion, which primarily includes our initial expected equity affiliate investment in the Jazan gas and power project as well as new plants that are currently under construction or expected to start construction. It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.We anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate (1) acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; (2) purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and (3) investment in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.35Table of ContentsFinancing ActivitiesFor the fiscal year ended 2019, cash used for financing activities was $1,370.5. This use of cash was largely attributable to dividend payments to shareholders of $994.0 and payments on long-term debt of $428.6. Payments on long-term debt primarily related to the repayment of a 4.375% U.S. Senior Note of $400.0 that matured on 21 August 2019. For the fiscal year ended 2018, cash used for financing activities was $1,359.8. This use of cash was largely attributable to dividend payments to shareholders of $897.8 and payments on long-term debt of $418.7. Payments on long-term debt primarily related to the repayment of a 1.2% U.S. Senior Note of $400.0 that matured on 16 October 2017. Financing and Capital StructureCapital needs in fiscal year 2019 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2019, total debt outstanding was $3,326.0 compared to $3,812.6 at the end of 2018, and cash and cash items were $2,248.7 compared to $2,791.3 at the end of 2018. Total debt as of 30 September 2019 includes related party debt $357.9 associated with the Lu'An joint venture.On 31 March 2017, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement maturing 31 March 2022 with a syndicate of banks (the “2017 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. On 28 September 2018, we amended the 2017 Credit Agreement to reduce the maximum borrowing capacity to $2,300.0. No other terms were impacted by the amendment.The 2017 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. The Company’s only financial covenant under the 2017 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (total debt plus total equity) no greater than 70%. Total debt at 30 September 2019 and 2018 expressed as a percentage of total capitalization was 22.6% and 25.4%, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2019.As of 30 September 2019, we classified our 2.000% Eurobond of €300 million ($327.0) maturing in August 2020 as long-term debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under the 2017 Credit Agreement. Our current intent is to refinance this debt via the U.S. or European public or private placement markets.Commitments totaling $2.3 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, all of which was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2019.As of 30 September 2019, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2019 or 2018. As of 30 September 2019, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.DividendsDividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. During 2019, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from $1.10 per share to $1.16 per share, or $4.64 per share annually.On 26 November 2019, the Board of Directors declared the first quarter 2020 dividend of $1.16 per share. The dividend is payable on 10 February 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 2 January 2020.36Table of ContentsCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSWe are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations on a continuing operations basis as of 30 September 2019: Total20202021202220232024ThereafterDebt maturities$3,275$367$440$439$454$454$1,121Contractual interest on debt4667869554435185Capital leases212311113Operating leases4187563443629171Pension obligations6413551525252399Unconditional purchase obligations8,3101,3584073693493505,477Deemed repatriation tax related to the Tax Act215—21212137115Obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate100100—————Total Contractual Obligations$13,446$2,015$1,054$981$957$958$7,481Debt ObligationsOur debt obligations include the maturity payments of the principal amount of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 16, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debt obligations.Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had approximately $635 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2019, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2019. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates and by interbank offer rates.LeasesRefer to Note 13, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases.Pension ObligationsThe amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that, in total, equal the recognized pension liabilities for our U.S. and international pension plans. For additional information, refer to Note 17, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment.The total accrued liability for pension benefits may be impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions.Unconditional Purchase ObligationsApproximately $7,100 of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium purchases. The majority of these obligations occur after fiscal year 2024. Helium purchases include crude feedstock supply to helium refining plants in North America as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world. As a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain take-if-tendered provisions. The refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas, primarily under medium-term requirements contracts. While contract terms in our helium sourcing contracts are generally longer than our customer sales contracts, helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties.37Table of ContentsApproximately $160 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers.We estimate our maximum obligation for future purchases of plant and equipment to be approximately $890 based on open purchase orders as of 30 September 2019. This includes spending for the Jiutai coal-to-syngas project. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to reschedule, cancel, or otherwise modify based on our business needs. We have disclosed this obligation in fiscal year 2020; however, timing of actual satisfaction of the obligation may vary.We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices.Income Tax LiabilitiesTax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2019 were $231.7. These tax liabilities were excluded from the table above as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. However, the table above includes our accrued liability of approximately $215 for deemed repatriation tax that is payable through 2026 related to the Tax Act. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Obligation for Future Contribution to an Equity AffiliateOn 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. We guarantee the repayment of our 25% share of an equity bridge loan to fund equity commitments to the joint venture. In total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. As of 30 September 2019, payables and accrued liabilities included $94.4 for our obligation to make future equity contributions in 2020 based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan.Expected Equity Affiliate Investment in Jazan Gas and Power ProjectOn 12 August 2018, Air Products entered an agreement to form a gasification/power joint venture (""JV"") with Saudi Aramco and ACWA in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products expects to own 51% of the JV, with Saudi Aramco and ACWA Power owning the balance. The JV will purchase the gasification assets, power block, and the associated utilities from Saudi Aramco for approximately $11.5 billion. Our expected equity affiliate investment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above pending financial closing, which is currently expected in fiscal year 2020.PENSION BENEFITSThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.The fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2019 measurement date increased to $4,504.8 from $4,273.1 at the end of fiscal year 2018. The projected benefit obligation for these plans was $5,145.6 and $4,583.3 at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The net unfunded liability increased $330.6 from $310.2 to $640.8, primarily due to lower discount rates partially offset by favorable asset experience. Refer to Note 17, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits.38Table of ContentsPension Expense 20192018Pension expense, including special items noted below$27.6$91.8Settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments (""special items"")7.248.9Weighted average discount rate – Service cost3.4%3.2%Weighted average discount rate – Interest cost 3.4%2.9%Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets6.4%6.9%Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase3.5%3.5%Pension expense decreased from the prior year due to lower pension settlements, lower loss amortization, primarily from favorable asset experience and the impact of higher discount rates, partially offset by lower expected returns on assets. Special items (settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments) decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses. In fiscal year 2019, special items of $7.2 included pension settlement losses of $6.4, of which $5.0 was recorded during the second quarter and related to the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan, and $.8 of termination benefits. These amounts are reflected within ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on the consolidated income statements. In fiscal year 2018, special items of $48.9 included a pension settlement loss of $43.7 primarily in connection with the transfer of certain pension assets and payment obligations for our U.S. salaried and hourly plans to an insurer during the fourth quarter, $4.8 of pension settlement losses related to lump sum payouts from the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan, and $.4 of termination benefits.U.K. Lloyds Equalization Ruling On 26 October 2018, the United Kingdom High Court issued a ruling related to the equalization of pension plan participants’ benefits for the gender effects of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions. As a result of this ruling, we estimated the impact of retroactively increasing benefits in our U.K. plan in accordance with the High Court ruling. We treated the additional benefits as a prior service cost, which resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss of $4.7 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. We are amortizing this cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the U.K. participants. 2020 OutlookIn fiscal year 2020, we expect pension expense to be approximately $5 to $20, which includes expected pension settlement losses of $5 to $10, depending on the timing of retirements. The expected range reflects lower expected interest cost and higher total assets, partially offset by higher expected loss amortization primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates. In fiscal year 2020, we expect pension expense to include approximately $105 for amortization of actuarial losses.In fiscal year 2019, pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $76.2. Net actuarial losses of $424.4 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2019. Actuarial (gains) losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial (gains) losses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2020.Pension FundingPension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2019 and 2018, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $40.2 and $68.3, respectively.For fiscal year 2020, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $30 to $40. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 37 for a projection of future contributions.39Table of ContentsENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the CERCLA, RCRA, and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $14.2 and $12.8 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Refer to Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $5 and $3, in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately $5 in both fiscal years 2020 and 2021.We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $68 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $82 as of 30 September 2019. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2019 and 2018 included an accrual of $68.9 and $76.8, respectively, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities. The accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and Pasadena, Texas, locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses. Refer to Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities.Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year.Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (""GHGs""), including carbon dioxide. These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading system, the California cap and trade scheme, China’s Emission Trading Scheme and its nation-wide expansion, and South Korea’s Emission Trading Scheme. In Canada, Alberta and Ontario are both in the development/approval process for new GHG regulations. Alberta’s Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation will end December 31, 2019 and will be replaced by the proposed Technology Innovation and Emission Reduction (""TIER"") System or Environment & Climate Change Canada's Output Based Pricing System (""OBPS""). In lieu of adherence to the OBPS, Ontario seeks approval from Environment & Climate Change Canada to implement their proposed GHG Emissions Performance Standards program. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs. Increased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We also have developed a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from steam methane reforming, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen.40Table of ContentsOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSWe have related party sales to some of our equity affiliates and joint venture partners as well as other income primarily from fees charged for use of Air Products' patents and technology. Sales to and other income from related parties totaled approximately $410 and $360 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales agreements with related parties include terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party.In addition, we completed the formation of Air Products Lu An (Changzhi) Co., Ltd., a 60%-owned JV with Lu'An Clean Energy Company (""Lu'An""), and the JV acquired gasification and syngas clean-up assets from Lu'An during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. Refer to Note 7, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on outstanding liabilities associated with the acquisition. INFLATIONWe operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESNote 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee.Depreciable Lives of Plant and EquipmentNet plant and equipment at 30 September 2019 totaled $10,337.6, and depreciation expense totaled $1,049.7 during fiscal year 2019. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.The regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.41Table of ContentsOur regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts aregenerally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. In addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on our historical experience with similar assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. Impairment of Assets – Plant and EquipmentPlant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.In fiscal year 2019, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset groupings may not be recoverable. However, one of our customers was subject to a government enforced shutdown due to environmental reasons. As a result, we recognized a charge of $29.0 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 primarily related to the write-off of related onsite assets. Refer to Note 24, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Impairment of Assets – GoodwillThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $797.1 as of 30 September 2019. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 11, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five business segments that are comprised of ten reporting units within seven operating segments. Refer to Note 26, Business Segment and Geographic Information, for additional information. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional Industrial Gases segments.42Table of ContentsAs part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. We choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test. We determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except LASA, which is further discussed below. Substantially all of the remaining goodwill balance related to reporting units in which the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 100%. The fair value of LASA exceeded its carrying value by 11%. Revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value. We determined that, with other assumptions held constant, a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 310 basis points or a decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 300 basis points would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being equal to its carrying value. As of 30 September 2019, the carrying value of LASA goodwill was $59.8, or less than 1% of consolidated total assets. The carrying value of LASA's other material assets at 30 September 2019 included: Plant and equipment, net of $339.2; customer relationships of $129.0; and trade names and trademarks of $41.3. The trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.Impairment of Assets – Intangible AssetsIntangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 September 2019 totaled $375.4 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined.43Table of ContentsIndefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2019 totaled $44.1 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.Disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 12, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements.In the fourth quarter of 2019, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles which resulted in no impairment.Impairment of Assets – Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,276.2 at 30 September 2019. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 9, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.An impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of an investment occurs. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. We utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach. For the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.In fiscal year 2019, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our equity affiliate investments as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.Revenue Recognition – Cost Incurred Input MethodRevenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule and technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.In addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities, our Jazan large air separation unit sale of equipment project within our Industrial Gases – Global segment requires monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method, including the Jazan project, favorably impacted operating income by approximately $37 and $38 in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years. We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.44Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition – On-site Customer ContractsFor customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities. Certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. At 30 September 2019, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded in noncurrent, was $302.0 and net deferred tax liabilities was $678.6. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2019 were $231.7, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2019 was $480.1 and includes a discrete net income tax expense of $43.8 related to the Tax Act. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.A 1% increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $23.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans.Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 17, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. 45Table of ContentsOne of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $18 per year.The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $20 per year.We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. For equities, this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $8 per year.Loss ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the Company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCESee Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.46Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKOur earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter intotransactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 14, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current and related party portions), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in Note 15, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. At 30 September 2019 and 2018, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $3,239.1 and $3,736.2, respectively. The decrease in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt.The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date.Interest Rate RiskOur debt portfolio as of 30 September 2019, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 74% fixed-rate debt and 26% variable-rate debt. Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2018, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 66% fixed-rate debt and 34% variable-rate debt. The decrease in variable-rate debt was the result of the repayment and maturity of the 4.375% Senior Note and related fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps.The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2019, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $75 and $96 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2019 and 2018, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $80 and $101 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2019 and 2018, respectively.Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $8 and $13 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2019 and 2018, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $8 and $13 per year at 30 September 2019 and 2018, respectively.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2019 and 2018, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $326 and $329 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2019 and 2018, respectively.The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.47Table of ContentsThe majority of the Company’s sales are derived from outside of the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. Financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $40 and $25, respectively.48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:34.318498

In response to COVID-19, we implemented certain health and safety policies to help keep our employees, contractors, customers, and communities safe while continuing to run our facilities, which generally have been considered ""essential"" by local governments and public health authorities. In compliance with government protocols, our non-essential employees were instructed to work from home until government mandated restrictions allow for a return to the workplace. Those working and visiting our sites are required to follow appropriate procedures, including completion of trainings and performance of self- and on-site screenings, as well as adhere to our personal protective equipment, social distancing, and personal hygiene protocols.21Table of ContentsBUSINESS OVERVIEWAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. is a world-leading industrial gases company that has been in operation for 80 years. Focused on serving energy, environment and emerging markets, we provide essential industrial gases, related equipment and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemical, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. Air Products is also the global leader in the supply of liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") process technology and equipment. We develop, engineer, build, own and operate some of the world's largest industrial gas projects, including gasification projects that sustainably convert abundant natural resources into syngas for the production of high-value power, fuels and chemicals.With operations in 50 countries, in fiscal year 2020 we had sales of $8.9 billion and assets of $25.2 billion. Approximately 19,275 passionate, talented and committed full- and part-time employees from diverse backgrounds are driven by Air Products’ higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability and address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world.As of 30 September 2020, our operations were organized into five reportable business segments:•Industrial Gases – Americas;•Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa);•Industrial Gases – Asia;•Industrial Gases – Global; and•Corporate and otherThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis discusses our results based on these operations. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.2020 IN SUMMARYIn fiscal year 2020, our number one priority was the safety and well-being of our people. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have kept our global plants running, supplied critical products, and supported our local communities during this time of need. We continued to win significant new growth projects around the world and serve our customers, delivering stable results despite the significant health crisis facing the world. We also remained focused on sustainability and our commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion. We set new goals that are aligned with Air Products' business strategy and higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability, and address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world.Fiscal year 2020 results and highlights are summarized below:•Sales of $8,856.3 decreased 1%, or $62.6, as 3% higher pricing and 2% favorable volumes were more than offset by 4% lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, 1% unfavorable currency, and the 1% impact of a contract modification to a tolling arrangement in India. We estimate that COVID-19 negatively impacted our overall sales by approximately 4%, primarily driven by lower volumes in our merchant business in the regional industrial gas segments. •Operating income of $2,237.6 increased 4%, or $93.2, and operating margin of 25.3% increased 130 bp. •Net income of $1,931.1 increased 7%, or $121.7, and net income margin of 21.8% increased 150 bp.•Adjusted EBITDA of $3,619.8 increased 4%, or $151.8, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.9% increased 200 bp.•Diluted EPS of $8.55 increased 8%, or $0.61, and adjusted diluted EPS of $8.38 increased 2%, or $0.17. We estimate that COVID-19 negatively impacted our fiscal year 2020 EPS by approximately $0.60-$0.65 per share. A summary table of changes in diluted EPS is presented below.22Table of ContentsFiscal year 2020 results and highlights (continued):•We increased our quarterly dividend by over 15% from $1.16 to $1.34 per share, representing the largest dividend increase in our 80-year history. This is the 38th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.•We successfully executed a debt offering of approximately $5 billion during the third quarter, supporting significant opportunities to invest in high-return industrial gas projects and the repayment of upcoming debt maturities. The issuance included both U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes.Changes in Diluted EPS Attributable to Air ProductsThe per share impacts presented in the table below were calculated independently and may not sum to the total change in diluted EPS due to rounding.IncreaseYear Ended 30 September20202019(Decrease)Diluted EPSTotal Diluted EPS$8.49 $7.94 $0.55 Less: Diluted EPS from loss from discontinued operations(0.06)— (0.06)Diluted EPS From Continuing Operations$8.55 $7.94 $0.61 Operating ImpactsUnderlying businessVolume($0.19)Price, net of variable costs0.77 Other costs(0.38)Currency(0.07)Facility closure0.10 Company headquarters relocation income (expense)0.12 Cost reduction actions0.08 Gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments(0.13)Total Operating Impacts$0.30 Other ImpactsEquity affiliates' income$0.06 Interest expense0.10 Other non-operating income (expense), net(0.13)Change in effective tax rate, excluding discrete items below0.04 India Finance Act 20200.06 Tax reform repatriation(0.06)Tax reform adjustment related to deemed foreign dividends0.26 Noncontrolling interests0.02 Weighted average diluted shares(0.03)Total Other Impacts$0.32 Total Change in Diluted EPS From Continuing Operations(A)$0.61 (A) Includes an estimated negative impact of $0.60-$0.65 from COVID-19.

We are committed to safely maintaining plant operations and ensuring business continuity, including providing financial security for employees, reliably supplying critical products and services to our customers, and winning new opportunities for world-scale projects.We expect lower volumes from COVID-19 to continue into fiscal year 2021 with recovery in demand depending on the duration of COVID-19 and measures implemented by governments, public health authorities and businesses to mitigate its spread. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the future impact on our ongoing business, results of operations, and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated.Despite the uncertainty of the duration of COVID-19, we will continue to focus on pricing discipline in our merchant business and expect our onsite business model, which represents approximately half of our business, to continue generating stable cash flow. This will allow us to execute our strategic focus on our industrial gas business and the creation of long-term shareholder value, including the ongoing growth of our dividend, continued execution of projects in our backlog, and new investments in high-return industrial gas projects.A long-term onsite customer in Asia delayed restarting their plant following a planned major maintenance turnaround completed in September 2020. While we expect the plant to restart in fiscal year 2021, we are negotiating with the customer regarding contract terms that could impact sales in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment.The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDiscussion of Consolidated Results20202019$ ChangeChangeGAAP MeasuresSales$8,856.3 $8,918.9 ($62.6)(1)%Operating income2,237.6 2,144.4 93.2 4 %Operating margin25.3 %24.0 %130 bpEquity affiliates’ income$264.8 $215.4 49.4 23 %Net income1,931.1 1,809.4 121.7 7 %Net income margin21.8 %20.3 %150 bpNon-GAAP MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA$3,619.8 $3,468.0 151.8 4 %Adjusted EBITDA margin40.9 %38.9 %200 bp24Table of ContentsSalesSales % Change from Prior YearVolume2 %Price3 %Energy and natural gas cost pass-through(4)%Currency(1)%Other(A)(1)%Total Consolidated Sales Change(1)%(A)Includes the impact from the modification of a hydrogen supply contract to a tolling arrangement in India in December 2018 (the ""India contract modification"").Sales of $8,856.3 decreased 1%, or $62.6, as higher pricing of 3% and favorable volumes of 2% were more than offset by lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 4%, unfavorable currency of 1%, and the impact from the India contract modification of 1%. The pricing improvement was attributable to our merchant business across the regional segments. The volume growth exceeded the negative impacts from COVID-19 and was primarily driven by acquisitions, new plants, and higher sale of equipment project activity. We estimate that COVID-19 negatively impacted overall sales by approximately 4%, primarily driven by lower volumes in our merchant business across the regional segments as our onsite business remained stable. Unfavorable currency impacts were driven by the Chilean Peso, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, and South Korean Won.Cost of Sales and Gross MarginCost of sales of $5,858.1 decreased 2%, or $146.4, from total cost of sales of $6,004.5 in the prior year, which included the facility closure further discussed below. The decrease from the prior year was driven by lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of $314, positive currency impacts of $73, the favorable impact from the India contract modification of $41, and the prior year facility closure of $29, partially offset by higher costs attributable to sales volumes of $250 and higher other costs, including planned maintenance, of $61. Gross margin of 33.9% increased 120 bp from 32.7% in the prior year, primarily due to positive pricing, lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, and the prior year facility closure, partially offset by unfavorable volume mix and net operating costs.Facility ClosureIn fiscal year 2019, one of our customers was subject to a government enforced shutdown due to environmental reasons. As a result, we recognized a charge of $29.0 ($22.1 after-tax, or $0.10 per share) primarily related to the write-off of onsite assets. This charge was reflected as “Facility closure” on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019 and was not recorded in segment results.Selling and AdministrativeSelling and administrative expense of $775.9 increased 3%, or $25.9, due to higher business development costs to support our growth strategy and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by currency impacts and lower travel expenses. Selling and administrative expense, as a percentage of sales, increased from 8.4% to 8.8%.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense of $83.9 increased 15%, or $11.0, primarily due to higher product development costs. Research and development expense as a percentage of sales increased from 0.8% to 0.9%.Company Headquarters Relocation Income (Expense) During the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we sold property at our current corporate headquarters located in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, for net proceeds of $44.1. The sale was completed in anticipation of relocating our U.S. headquarters and resulted in a gain of $33.8 ($25.6 after-tax, or $0.12 per share). This gain is reflected on our consolidated income statements as ""Company headquarters relocation income (expense)"" for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020 and was not recorded in segment results.25Table of ContentsCost Reduction ActionsIn fiscal year 2019, we recognized an expense of $25.5 ($18.8 after-tax, or $0.08 per share) for severance and other benefits associated with position eliminations, primarily within the Industrial Gases – EMEA and the Industrial Gases – Americas segments. This expense was reflected as ""Cost reduction actions"" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019 and was not recorded in segment results. Refer to Note 5, Cost Reduction Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Gain on Exchange of Equity Affiliate InvestmentsIn fiscal year 2019, we recognized a net gain of $29.1 ($0.13 per share) resulting from the exchange of two 50%-owned industrial gas joint ventures in China. The net gain was reflected as ""Gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments"" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019 and was not recorded in segment results. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net of $65.4 increased 33%, or $16.1, primarily due to the adjustment of a benefit plan liability resulting from a change in plan terms.Operating Income and MarginOperating income of $2,237.6 increased 4%, or $93.2, due to positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $212, income associated with the company headquarters relocation of $34, and prior year charges for a facility closure of $29 and cost reduction actions of $26, partially offset by higher net operating costs of $104, including planned maintenance, unfavorable volume mix of $55, a gain on the exchange of equity affiliates of $29 in the prior year, and unfavorable currency of $20. Operating margin of 25.3% increased 130 bp, primarily due to positive pricing, lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, the impact of income associated with the company headquarters relocation, and prior year charges for a facility closure and cost reduction actions, partially offset by unfavorable volume mix, higher operating costs, and a gain on the exchange of two equity affiliates in the prior year.Equity Affiliates’ IncomeEquity affiliates' income of $264.8 increased 23%, or $49.4, primarily due to a current year benefit of $33.8 for the release of our share of accumulated dividend distribution taxes related to an Indian affiliate as a result of the enactment of a tax law in India. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The current year also includes higher income from affiliates in India, Italy, and Saudi Arabia, partially offset by negative impacts from COVID-19.Interest Expense20202019Interest incurred$125.2 $150.5 Less: Capitalized interest15.9 13.5 Interest expense$109.3 $137.0 Interest incurred decreased 17%, or $25.3. The prior year included an expense of $33.3 related to foreign currency forward points and currency swap basis differences (""excluded components"") of our cash flow hedges of intercompany loans. As discussed in Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements, we adopted new accounting guidance on hedging activities that changed the presentation of these items from ""Interest expense, net"" to “Other non-operating income (expense), net” in fiscal year 2020. In addition to this presentation change, interest incurred decreased due to lower expenses related to the Lu'An joint venture financing and a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio, partially offset by a higher debt balance due to the issuance of debt during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We expect interest expense to be higher in future periods due to this issuance. Capitalized interest increased 18%, or $2.4, due to an increase in the carrying value of projects under construction.26Table of ContentsOther Non-Operating Income (Expense), NetOther non-operating income of $30.7 decreased 54%, or $36.0, primarily due to an expense of $33.5 for the excluded components of cash flow hedges of intercompany loans. These components were historically recorded in ""Interest expense"" prior to the adoption of the guidance discussed above. The current year also included lower interest income on cash and cash items. These factors were partially offset by higher non-service pension income due to lower interest cost and higher expected asset returns, primarily for our U.S. pension plans. The prior year includes a settlement loss of $5.0 ($3.8 after-tax, or $0.02 per share) associated with the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan.Discontinued OperationsDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we recorded a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of $19.0 ($14.3 after-tax, or $0.06 per share) to increase our liability for retained environmental obligations associated with the sale of our former Amines business in September 2006. Refer to the Pace discussion within Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Net Income and Net Income MarginNet income of $1,931.1 increased 7%, or $121.7, primarily due to higher pricing and income from the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters. In addition, the prior year was negatively impacted by a facility closure, cost reduction actions, and the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These factors were partially offset by higher costs, including the after-tax loss from discontinued operations, unfavorable volume mix, and a gain on the exchange of two equity affiliates in the prior year. Net income margin of 21.8% increased 150 bp, primarily due to the factors noted above as well as lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginAdjusted EBITDA of $3,619.8 increased 4%, or $151.8, primarily due to higher pricing, partially offset by higher operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.9% increased 200 bp, primarily due to the higher pricing and lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, partially offset by unfavorable volume mix and higher operating costs.Effective Tax RateThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. The effective tax rate was 19.7% and 21.0% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2020 and 2019, respectively.The 2019 tax rate reflected a discrete net income tax expense of $43.8 related to impacts from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The net expense included the reversal of a non-recurring $56.2 ($0.26 per share) benefit recorded in 2018 related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends. This was partially offset by a benefit of $12.4 ($0.06 per share) to finalize our estimates of the impacts of the Tax Act and reduce the total expected costs of the deemed repatriation tax. In addition, the net expense from the Tax Act was partially offset by benefits from changes in valuation allowance recorded at various entities in 2019.The lower current year rate reflects favorable impacts from higher benefits on the revaluation of deferred tax accounts due to enacted changes in foreign tax law, changes in the tax profile of U.S. entities in various state jurisdictions, and higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. These items were partially offset by the enactment of the India Finance Act 2020 (the ""India Finance Act""), which increased income tax expense by $20.3. The enactment also increased equity affiliates' income by $33.8 for changes in the future tax costs of repatriated earnings. The overall impact to net income resulting from the India Finance Act was a benefit of $13.5 ($0.06 per share).The adjusted effective tax rate was 19.1% and 19.4% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2020 and 2019, respectively. The lower current year rate reflects favorable impacts from higher benefits on the revaluation of deferred tax accounts due to enacted changes in foreign tax law, changes in the tax profile of U.S. entities in various state jurisdictions, and higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. These items were partially offset by benefits from changes in valuation allowances recorded at various entities in 2019.Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.27Table of ContentsSegment AnalysisIndustrial Gases – AmericasYear Ended 30 September20202019$ ChangeChangeSales$3,630.7 $3,873.5 ($242.8)(6)%Operating income1,012.4 997.7 14.7 1 %Operating margin27.9 %25.8 %210 bpEquity affiliates’ income$84.3 $84.8 ($0.5)(1)%Adjusted EBITDA1,656.2 1,587.7 68.5 4 %Adjusted EBITDA margin45.6 %41.0 %460 bpSales % Change from Prior YearVolume(1)%Price3 %Energy and natural gas cost pass-through(6)%Currency(2)%Total Industrial Gases – Americas Sales Change(6)%Sales of $3,630.7 decreased 6%, or $242.8, as lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 6%, a negative impact from currency of 2%, and lower volumes of 1% were partially offset by positive pricing of 3%. The pricing improvement was driven by our merchant business. Lower volumes, particularly in our merchant business, were primarily driven by COVID-19, which began impacting this segment at the end of March 2020 and continued through the end of the fiscal year. The negative impact of COVID-19 was partially offset by positive contributions from the commencement of a long-term hydrogen supply agreement with PBF Energy Inc. from assets we acquired in April. The unfavorable currency impact was driven by the Chilean Peso.Operating income of $1,012.4 increased 1%, or $14.7, due to higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $95, partially offset by higher net operating costs of $40, lower volumes of $33, and unfavorable currency impacts of $7.

The pricing improvement was attributable to our merchant business. Volumes were flat versus the prior year as improvements from acquisitions and demand for hydrogen in our Rotterdam pipeline system were offset by lower volumes from COVID-19, particularly in our merchant business. COVID-19 began impacting this segment at the end of March 2020 and continued through the end of the fiscal year. The negative currency impact was mainly driven by the Euro.Operating income of $473.3 was flat as higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $71 was offset by higher costs of $41, unfavorable volume mix of $27, and unfavorable currency impacts of $3. Operating margin of 24.6% increased 100 bp, primarily due to favorable pricing, lower energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, and the India contract modification, partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable volume mix.Equity affiliates’ income of $74.8 increased 8%, or $5.8, primarily due to Jazan Gas Projects Company, which began to contribute in the second half of fiscal year 2019, and higher income from an affiliate in Italy.29Table of ContentsIndustrial Gases – Asia20202019$ ChangeChangeSales$2,716.5 $2,663.6 $52.9 2 %Operating income870.3 864.2 6.1 1 %Operating margin32.0 %32.4 %(40) bpEquity affiliates’ income$61.0 $58.4 $2.6 4 %Adjusted EBITDA1,330.7 1,284.1 46.6 4 %Adjusted EBITDA margin49.0 %48.2 %80 bpSales % Change from Prior YearVolume1 %Price2 %Energy and natural gas cost pass-through— %Currency(1)%Total Industrial Gases – Asia Sales Change2 %Sales of $2,716.5 increased 2%, or $52.9, as positive pricing of 2% and higher volumes of 1% were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 1%.

The negative impact from COVID-19 was primarily on our merchant volumes. Pricing improved across Asia, driven by our merchant business. The unfavorable currency impact was primarily attributable to the Chinese Renminbi and the South Korean Won. Energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers was flat versus the prior year.Operating income of $870.3 increased 1%, or $6.1, due to positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $46 and favorable net operating costs of $4, partially offset by unfavorable volume mix of $33 and currency impacts of $11.

On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and adjusted effective tax rate. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also include certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are presented below to help the reader understand the impact that our non-GAAP adjustments have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present below a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our business because such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude certain disclosed items, or “non-GAAP adjustments,” that we believe are not representative of underlying business performance. For example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. The tax impact on our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions. 31Table of ContentsADJUSTED DILUTED EPSThe table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. We believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of our non-GAAP adjustments as management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. The per share impact for each non-GAAP adjustment was calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.Year Ended 30 SeptemberOperating IncomeEquity Affiliates' IncomeIncome Tax ProvisionNet Income Attributable to Air ProductsDiluted EPS2020 GAAP$2,237.6 $264.8 $478.4 $1,901.0 $8.55 2019 GAAP2,144.4 215.4 480.1 1,760.0 7.94 Change GAAP$141.0 $0.61 % Change GAAP8 %8 %2020 GAAP$2,237.6 $264.8 $478.4 $1,901.0 $8.55 Company headquarters relocation (income) expense(33.8)— (8.2)(25.6)(0.12)India Finance Act 2020— (33.8)(20.3)(13.5)(0.06)2020 Non-GAAP Measure (""Adjusted"")$2,203.8 $231.0 $449.9 $1,861.9 $8.38 2019 GAAP$2,144.4 $215.4 $480.1 $1,760.0 $7.94 Facility closure29.0 — 6.9 22.1 0.10 Cost reduction actions25.5 — 6.7 18.8 0.08 Gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments(29.1)— — (29.1)(0.13)Pension settlement loss(A)— — 1.2 3.8 0.02 Tax reform repatriation— — 12.4 (12.4)(0.06)Tax reform adjustment related to deemed foreign dividends— — (56.2)56.2 0.26 2019 Non-GAAP Measure (""Adjusted"")$2,169.8 $215.4 $451.1 $1,819.4 $8.21 Change Non-GAAP Measure (""Adjusted"")$42.5 $0.17 % Change Non-GAAP Measure (""Adjusted"")2 %2 %(A)Before-tax impact of $5.0 is reflected on the consolidated income statements within “Other non-operating income (expense), net.”The table below provides a reconciliation of adjusted diluted EPS to GAAP diluted EPS for each fiscal year noted:Year Ended 30 September20202019201820172016Diluted EPS$8.55 $7.94 $6.59 $5.16 $5.04 Change in inventory valuation method— — (0.08)— — Facility closure— 0.10 — — — Business separation costs— — — 0.12 0.21 Tax (benefit) costs associated with business separation— — — (0.02)0.24 Cost reduction and asset actions— 0.08 — 0.49 0.11 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge— — — 0.70 — Gain on exchange of equity affiliate investments— (0.13)— — — Company headquarters relocation (income) expense(0.12)— — — — Gain on land sale— — — (0.03)— India Finance Act 2020(0.06)— — — — Equity method investment impairment charge— — — 0.36 — Pension settlement loss— 0.02 0.15 0.03 0.02 Loss on extinguishment of debt— — — — 0.02 Tax reform repatriation— (0.06)2.16 — — Tax reform adjustment related to deemed foreign dividends— 0.26 (0.25)— — Tax reform rate change and other— — (0.96)— — Tax restructuring— — (0.16)— — Tax election benefit— — — (0.50)— Adjusted Diluted EPS$8.38 $8.21 $7.45 $6.31 $5.64 32Table of ContentsADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGINWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance. Margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding.

In addition, we have the flexibility to access capital through a variety of financing activities, including accessing the capital markets, drawing upon our credit facility, or alternatively, accessing the commercial paper markets. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we issued U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes with aggregate principal amounts of $3.8 billion and €1.0 billion ($1.2 billion as of 30 September 2020), respectively. We intend to use the majority of the proceeds to fund growth projects and repay debt maturities through 2021, including a €350.0 million Eurobond due in June 2021. At this time, we have not utilized, nor do we expect to access, our credit facility for additional liquidity. In addition, we have considered the impacts of COVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources and do not expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs.As of 30 September 2020, we had $1,376.6 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of $5,253.0. Since the enactment of the Tax Act, we do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. Depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the U.S. 35Table of ContentsThe table below summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities as reflected on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended 30 September:Cash Provided by (Used for)20202019Operating activities$3,264.7 $2,969.9 Investing activities(3,560.0)(2,113.4)Financing activities3,284.7 (1,370.5)Operating ActivitiesFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $3,264.7. Income from continuing operations of $1,901.0 was adjusted for items including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, gain on sale of assets and investments, share-based compensation, noncurrent capital lease receivables, and certain other adjustments. We recorded a net benefit of $13.5 on our consolidated income statements related to a recently enacted tax law in India during the second quarter. This net benefit, which is further discussed in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements, increased ""Undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates"" by $33.8 and increased ""Deferred income taxes"" by $20.3. The ""Gain on sale of assets and investments"" of $45.8 includes a gain of $33.8 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters. Refer to Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $40.1, primarily driven by other working capital uses of $130.6, partially offset by a source of $84.4 from other receivables. The use of cash within ""Other working capital"" was primarily due to timing of tax payments and a tax benefit as a result of the assets acquired in April 2020 from PBF Energy Inc. The source of cash within ""Other receivables"" was primarily driven by maturities of forward exchange contracts.For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $2,969.9, including income from continuing operations of $1,760.0. The gain on sale of assets and investments included a gain of $14.1 recognized on the disposition of our interest in High-Tech Gases (Beijing) Co., Ltd., a previously held equity investment in our Industrial Gases - Asia segment. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $25.3, primarily driven by $69.0 from trade receivables and $41.8 from payables and accrued liabilities, partially offset by $79.8 from other receivables. The use of cash within ""Payables and accrued liabilities"" was primarily driven by a $48.9 decrease in accrued utilities and a $30.3 decrease in accrued interest, partially offset by a $51.6 increase in customer advances primarily related to sale of equipment activity. The decrease in accrued utilities was primarily driven by a contract modification to a tolling arrangement in India and lower utility costs in the Industrial Gases – Americas segment. The source of cash from other receivables of $79.8 was primarily due to the maturities of forward exchange contracts that hedged foreign currency exposures and the collection of value added taxes.Investing ActivitiesFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020, cash used for investing activities was $3,560.0. Payments for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,509.0. This includes the acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from PBF Energy Inc. in Delaware and California for approximately $580 during the third quarter. Additionally, acquisitions, less cash acquired, includes $183.3 for three businesses we acquired on 1 July 2020, the largest of which was a business in Israel that primarily offers merchant gas products. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Purchases of investments of $2,865.5 relate to time deposits and treasury securities with terms greater than three months and less than one year and exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,938.0. Proceeds from sale of assets and investments of $80.3 includes net proceeds of $44.1 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters in the second quarter.For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019, cash used for investing activities was $2,113.4. Payments for additions to plant and equipment totaled $1,989.7. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $123.2. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for further details. Proceeds from investments of $190.5 resulting from maturities of short-term instruments with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year exceeded purchases of $172.1.36Table of ContentsCapital ExpendituresCapital expenditures is a non-GAAP measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. A reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below:20202019Cash used for investing activities$3,560.0 $2,113.4 Proceeds from sale of assets and investments80.3 11.1 Purchases of investments(2,865.5)(172.1)Proceeds from investments1,938.0 190.5 Other investing activities3.9 (14.3)Capital Expenditures$2,716.7 $2,128.6 The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below:20202019Additions to plant and equipment$2,509.0 $1,989.7 Acquisitions, less cash acquired183.3 123.2 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates24.4 15.7 Capital Expenditures$2,716.7 $2,128.6 Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2020 totaled $2,716.7 compared to $2,128.6 in fiscal year 2019. The increase of $588.1 was primarily due to the acquisition of the hydrogen production plants from PBF Energy Inc., as noted above. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements.2021 Outlook for Investing ActivitiesDue to the significant uncertainty that remains regarding the duration of COVID-19, the pace of recovery, and its negative impact on the global economy, we are not providing capital expenditure guidance for fiscal year 2021. We are monitoring our projects to determine whether capital spending and project onstream timing may be delayed for those currently under construction.We anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate (1) acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; (2) purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and (3) investment in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.Financing ActivitiesIn fiscal year 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $3,284.7 as we successfully accessed the debt markets in April 2020 to support opportunities for growth projects and repay upcoming debt maturities. Long-term debt proceeds of $4,895.8, as further discussed below under ""Financing and Capital Structure,"" were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of $1,103.6 and payments on long-term debt of $406.6 primarily related to the repayment of a 2.0% Eurobond of €300.0 million ($353.9) that matured on 7 August 2020. Other financing activities were a use of cash of $80.1 and included financing charges associated with the third quarter debt issuance.For the fiscal year ended 2019, cash used for financing activities was $1,370.5. This use of cash was largely attributable to dividend payments to shareholders of $994.0 and payments on long-term debt of $428.6. Payments on long-term debt primarily related to the repayment of a 4.375% U.S. Senior Note of $400.0 that matured on 21 August 2019. 37Table of ContentsFinancing and Capital StructureCapital needs in fiscal year 2020 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. Total debt increased from $3,326.0 at 30 September 2019 to $7,907.8 at 30 September 2020 due to the issuance of U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes in the third quarter, partially offset by the repayment of a 2.0% Eurobond. For additional information, refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements. Similarly, cash and cash items and short-term investments increased from $2,248.7 and $166.0, respectively, at the end of 2019 to $5,253.0 and $1,104.9, respectively, at the end of 2020, primarily due to the issuance of the notes. The current year total debt balance includes $338.5 of related party debt associated with the Lu'An joint venture.We have a $2,300.0 five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the ""Credit Agreement”) maturing 31 March 2022. Under the Credit Agreement, senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement provides us a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. Our only financial covenant under the Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization, or total debt plus total equity, no greater than 70%. Total debt as of 30 September 2020 and 30 September 2019, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization was 38.9% and 22.6%, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2020.There were no commitments maintained by our foreign subsidiaries at 30 September 2020.As of 30 September 2020, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2020 or 2019. As of 30 September 2020, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.DividendsDividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. In 2020, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by over 15% from $1.16 to $1.34 per share, representing the largest dividend increase in our 80-year history. This is the 38th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.On 19 November 2020, the Board of Directors declared the first quarter 2021 dividend of $1.34 per share. The dividend is payable on 8 February 2021 to shareholders of record as of 4 January 2021.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSWe are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations on a continuing operations basis as of 30 September 2020:Total20212022202320242025ThereafterDebt maturities$7,950 $470 $442 $456 $456 $416 $5,710 Contractual interest on debt1,772 155 141 129 121 102 1,124 Operating leases475 79 56 47 37 30 226 Pension obligations598 51 45 42 42 28 390 Unconditional purchase obligations9,556 1,460 460 450 455 454 6,277 Deemed repatriation tax related to the Tax Act211 21 21 21 39 50 59 Obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate100 100 — — — — — Total Contractual Obligations$20,662 $2,336 $1,165 $1,145 $1,150 $1,080 $13,786 38Table of ContentsDebt ObligationsOur debt obligations include the maturity payments of the principal amount of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debt obligations.Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had approximately $632 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2020, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2020. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates and by interbank offer rates.LeasesWe are the lessee under various agreements for real estate, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment. Refer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Pension ObligationsThe amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that, in total, equal the recognized pension liabilities for our U.S. and international pension plans. For additional information, refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment.The total accrued liability for pension benefits may be impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions.Unconditional Purchase ObligationsWe are obligated to make future payments under unconditional purchase obligations, which primarily relate to helium and rare gases as well as commitments for purchases of plant and equipment. For additional information, refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.Income Tax LiabilitiesTax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2020 were $237.0. These tax liabilities are not included in the table above as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. However, the table above includes our accrued liability of approximately $211 for deemed repatriation tax that is payable through 2026 related to the Tax Act. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Obligation for Future Contribution to an Equity AffiliateOn 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. We guaranteed the repayment of our 25% share of an equity bridge loan that has been provided to fund equity commitments to the joint venture. In total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. As of 30 September 2020, our consolidated balance sheets included $94.4 reflected within ""Payables and accrued liabilities"" for our obligation to make future equity contributions in 2021 based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan.Future Investment in Jazan Gas and Power ProjectOn 12 August 2018, Air Products entered an agreement to form a gasification/power joint venture (""JV"") with Saudi Aramco and ACWA in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products expects to own 51% of the JV, with Saudi Aramco and ACWA Power owning the balance. In July 2020, we commenced the process to secure project financing with our partners for the JV, which will purchase the gasification assets, power block, and the associated utilities from Saudi Aramco for approximately $12 billion. Our future investment is not considered a contractual obligation until definitive agreements have been signed; therefore, it is not included in the contractual obligations table above.39Table of ContentsPENSION BENEFITSWe and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.The fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2020 measurement date increased to $4,775.1 from $4,504.8 at the end of fiscal year 2019. The projected benefit obligation for these plans was $5,373.5 and $5,145.6 at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The net unfunded liability decreased $42.4 from $640.8 to $598.4, primarily due to favorable asset experience. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits.Pension Expense20202019Pension expense, including special items noted below$7.0 $27.6 Settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments (""special items"")5.2 7.2 Weighted average discount rate – Service cost2.4 %3.4 %Weighted average discount rate – Interest cost 2.3 %3.4 %Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets6.3 %6.4 %Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase3.4 %3.5 %Pension expense decreased from the prior year due to lower interest cost and higher total assets, partially offset by higher actuarial loss amortization due to the impact of lower discount rates. Special items (settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments) decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses. In fiscal year 2020, special items of $5.2 included pension settlement losses of $5.0 related to lump sum payouts from the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan. These amounts are reflected within ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on the consolidated income statements. In fiscal year 2019, special items of $7.2 included pension settlement losses of $6.4 related to lump sum payouts from the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan and $0.8 of termination benefits.U.K. Lloyds Equalization Ruling On 26 October 2018, the United Kingdom High Court issued a ruling related to the equalization of pension plan participants’ benefits for the gender effects of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions. As a result of this ruling, we estimated the impact of retroactively increasing benefits in our U.K. plan in accordance with the High Court ruling. We treated the additional benefits as a prior service cost, which resulted in an increase to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive loss of $4.7 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. We are amortizing this cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the U.K. participants. 2021 OutlookIn fiscal year 2021, we expect pension income of approximately $25 to $35, which includes expected pension settlement losses of $0 to $5, depending on the timing of retirements. The expected income range reflects lower expected interest cost and higher total assets. In fiscal year 2021, we expect our net pension income to include approximately $100 for amortization of actuarial losses.In fiscal year 2020, pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $103.2. Net actuarial losses of $83.5 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2020. Actuarial (gains) losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial (gains) losses and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2021.Pension FundingPension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.40Table of ContentsIn addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2020 and 2019, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $37.5 and $40.2, respectively.For fiscal year 2021, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $45 to $55. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. We do not expect COVID-19 to impact our contribution forecast for fiscal year 2021. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 38 for a projection of future contributions.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSAs discussed above in Item 1, “Business–Environmental Regulation”, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations, which results in higher capital expenditures and costs. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $18.3 and $14.2 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet our internal standards. We estimate that we spent approximately $4 and $5, in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution. We expect that our capital expenditures to control pollution will be approximately $6 in both fiscal years 2021 and 2022.Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSWe have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSSee Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning activity with our related parties.INFLATIONWe operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis.41Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESNote 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee.Depreciable Lives of Plant and EquipmentNet plant and equipment at 30 September 2020 totaled $11,964.7, and depreciation expense totaled $1,150.5 during fiscal year 2020. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business circumstances change. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.The regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.Our regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. In addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. 42Table of ContentsImpairment of AssetsWhile our results of operations have been negatively affected by COVID-19 as of and for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020, there have been no triggering events that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups, reporting units that contain goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or equity method investments. As further discussed below, we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded there were no indications of impairment. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of COVID-19 impacts on our business and any impact they may have on management's estimates, particularly those for our Latin America business. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and its long-term impact on our business is uncertain.Impairment of Assets – Plant and EquipmentPlant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.In fiscal year 2020, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset groupings may not be recoverable.Impairment of Assets – GoodwillThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $891.5 as of 30 September 2020. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five reportable business segments, seven operating segments and ten reporting units, seven of which include a goodwill balance. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, for additional information. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional Industrial Gases segments.43Table of ContentsAs part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. However, we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test. We determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except for our Latin America reporting unit (LASA), which is further discussed below. Substantially all of the remaining goodwill balance related to reporting units in which the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 100%. The fair value of LASA exceeded its carrying value by 10%. Revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value. We determined that, with other assumptions held constant, a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 320 basis points or a decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 290 basis points would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being equal to its carrying value. As of 30 September 2020, the carrying value of LASA goodwill was $56.1, or less than 1% of consolidated total assets. The carrying value of LASA's other material assets at 30 September 2020 included: Plant and equipment, net of $309.2; customer relationships of $112.1; and trade names and trademarks of $38.2. The trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, changes in the strategy of the reporting unit, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.44Table of ContentsImpairment of Assets – Intangible AssetsIntangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 September 2020 totaled $394.8 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under ""Impairment of Assets – Plant and Equipment"" for a description of how impairment losses are determined.Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2020 totaled $41.0 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.Disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 11, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements.In the fourth quarter of 2020, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles which resulted in no impairment.Impairment of Assets – Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,432.2 at 30 September 2020. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.An impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. We utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach. For the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.In fiscal year 2020, there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment, as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.Revenue Recognition – Cost Incurred Input MethodRevenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule and technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.45Table of ContentsIn addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities, our sale of equipment projects within our Industrial Gases – Global segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method, including the Jazan project, favorably impacted operating income by approximately $7 and $37 in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years. We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.Revenue Recognition – On-site Customer ContractsFor customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities. Certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As of 30 September 2020, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded as noncurrent, was $296.7, and net deferred tax liabilities were $847.5. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2020 were $237.0, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020 was $478.4. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.A 1% increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of approximately $24.46Table of ContentsPension and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans.Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. We measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $26 per year.The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $22 per year.We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. For equities, this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $12 per year.Loss ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.47Table of ContentsContingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the liability increases. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCESee Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, and Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties; interest rate swaps; cross currency interest rate swaps; and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the ""net financial instrument position"" and is disclosed in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. Our net financial instrument position increased from a liability of $3,239.1 at 30 September 2019 to a liability of $8,220.7 at 30 September 2020 due to the issuance of the $3.8 billion U.S. Dollar-denominated notes and €1.0 billion Eurobonds in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. See Note 15, Debt, for additional information.The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date, such as interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities.Interest Rate RiskOur debt portfolio as of 30 September 2020, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 89% fixed-rate debt and 11% variable-rate debt. Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2019, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 74% fixed-rate debt and 26% variable-rate debt. The increase in fixed rate debt is the result of the U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated notes issued during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020.The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2020, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $711 and $75 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $846 and $80 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 48Table of ContentsSeptember 2020 and 2019, respectively. The longer maturities and increased principal associated with the U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated notes issued during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 created a higher sensitivity to market interest rates.Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $8 of interest incurred per year at 30 September 2020 and 2019. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $8 per year at 30 September 2020 and 2019.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2020 and 2019, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $360 and $326 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2020 and 2019, respectively.The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.The majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the United States. Therefore, financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $40 and $25, respectively.COVID-19 Risks and Uncertainties Refer to Item 1A.

Focused on serving energy, environment and emerging markets, we provide essential industrial gases, related equipment, and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. We are the world's largest supplier of hydrogen and have built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") process technology and equipment. We develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world's largest industrial gas projects, including gasification projects that sustainably convert abundant natural resources into syngas for the production of high-value power, fuels, and chemicals and are developing carbon capture projects and world-scale low carbon and carbon-free hydrogen projects that will support global transportation and the energy transition away from fossil fuels.22Table of ContentsWith operations in over 50 countries, in fiscal year 2021 we had sales of $10.3 billion and assets of $26.9 billion. Approximately 20,875 passionate, talented, and committed employees from diverse backgrounds are driven by our higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability, and address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world.As of 30 September 2021, our operations were organized into five reportable business segments under which we managed our operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings: •Industrial Gases – Americas;•Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa);•Industrial Gases – Asia;•Industrial Gases – Global; and•Corporate and otherThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis discusses our results based on these operations. Refer to Note 23, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.On 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments effective 1 October 2021. Refer to Note 24, Subsequent Events, for additional information.2021 IN SUMMARYIn fiscal year 2021, we continued to execute our growth strategy, including announcement of several new gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen projects that will drive the world’s energy transition from fossil fuels. At the same time, we remained focused on our base business, delivering consistent results despite external challenges globally and absorbing costs for additional resources needed to support growth. In the second half of the year, demand for most merchant products returned to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, we continued to create shareholder value by increasing the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.50 per share, representing a 12% increase from the previous dividend. This is the 39th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.Fiscal year 2021 results are summarized below:•Sales of $10.3 billion increased 17%, or $1.5 billion, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, higher volumes, favorable currency impacts, and positive pricing that more than offset power cost increases in the second half of the year.•Operating income of $2,281.4 increased 2%, or $43.8, and operating margin of 22.1% decreased 320 basis points (""bp""). •Net income of $2,114.9 increased 10%, or $183.8, and net income margin of 20.5% decreased 130 bp.•Adjusted EBITDA of $3,883.2 increased 7%, or $263.4, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.6% decreased 330 bp.•Diluted EPS of $9.12 increased 7%, or $0.57 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS of $9.02 increased 8%, or $0.64 per share.

Refer to the sales discussion below for additional detail. The volume impact from the Lu'An facility is partially offset by the positive impact of lower net income being attributed to our joint venture partner within ""Noncontrolling interests.""Fiscal Year Ended 30 September20212020Increase(Decrease)Diluted EPS From Continuing Operations$9.12 $8.55 $0.57 Facility closure0.08 — 0.08 Gain on exchange with joint venture partner(0.12)— (0.12)Company headquarters relocation income— (0.12)0.12 India Finance Act 2020— (0.06)0.06 Tax election benefit and other(0.05)— (0.05)Adjusted Diluted EPS From Continuing Operations$9.02 $8.38 $0.64 24Table of Contents2022 OUTLOOKThe guidance below should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We believe our achievements in 2021 are just the beginning of our journey providing gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen for mobility solutions to address the world’s most significant energy and environmental sustainability challenges. For example, we expect our world-scale Jazan gasification project with Aramco, ACWA Power, and Air Products Qudra to begin contributing to our results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We expect to continue to pursue new, high-return opportunities that are aligned with our growth strategy and to add the resources necessary for project development and execution. We remain committed to creating shareholder value through capital deployment and delivering increased dividends, as we have done for the past 39 consecutive years.The duration and extent of ongoing global challenges, such as rising energy costs, energy consumption curtailment, and supply chain disruptions, remain uncertain. For our merchant business, we plan to continue pricing actions to recover higher energy costs. We expect to add new projects to our onsite business model, which has contractual protection from energy cost fluctuations and generates stable cash flow. We expect higher costs from planned maintenance activities on our facilities in fiscal year 2022 and higher pension expense resulting from lower expected returns on assets.Additionally, we expect the Lu’An facility to continue operating under the interim agreement discussed below through fiscal year 2022.In fiscal year 2022, we will also continue to focus on our other sustainability goals, including our commitment to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions intensity and advance diversity and inclusion.On 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments, including the separation of our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment into two separate reporting segments: Industrial Gases – Europe and Industrial Gases – Middle East. The results of an affiliate formerly reflected in the Industrial Gases – Asia segment will now be reported in the Industrial Gases – Middle East segment. Additionally, the results of our Industrial Gases – Global operating segment will be reflected in the Corporate and other segment. Beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, segment results will be presented on a retrospective basis to reflect the reorganization.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDiscussion of Consolidated ResultsFiscal Year Ended 30 September20212020$ ChangeChangeGAAP MeasuresSales$10,323.0$8,856.3$1,466.7 17 %Operating income2,281.42,237.643.8 2 %Operating margin22.1 %25.3 %(320) bpEquity affiliates’ income$294.1$264.829.3 11 %Net income2,114.91,931.1183.8 10 %Net income margin20.5 %21.8 %(130) bpNon-GAAP MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA$3,883.2$3,619.8263.4 7 %Adjusted EBITDA margin37.6 %40.9 %(330) bpSales % Change from Prior YearVolume5 %Price2 %Energy and natural gas cost pass-through6 %Currency4 %Total Consolidated Sales Change17 %25Table of ContentsSales of $10,323.0 increased 17%, or $1,466.7, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 6%, higher volumes of 5%, favorable currency impacts of 4%, and positive pricing of 2%. We experienced significantly higher energy and natural gas costs in the second half of fiscal year 2021, particularly in North America and Europe. Contractual provisions associated with our on-site business, which represents approximately half our total company sales, allow us to pass these costs to our customers. Positive volumes from new assets, our sale of equipment businesses, and merchant demand recovery from COVID-19 were partially offset by reduced contributions from the Lu'An gasification project discussed below. Favorable currency was primarily driven by the appreciation of the British Pound Sterling, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, and South Korean Won against the U.S. Dollar. Continued focus on pricing actions, including energy cost recovery, in our merchant businesses resulted in price improvement in each of our three regional segments.Lu’An Clean Energy Company (“Lu’An”), a long-term onsite customer in Asia with which we have a consolidated joint venture, restarted its facility in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 following successful completion of major maintenance work in September 2020. Our facility resumed operations, and the joint venture is supplying product at reduced charges as agreed upon with Lu'An under a short-term agreement reached in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. As a result of this agreement, we recognized lower revenue in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment in each quarter of fiscal year 2021. We expect this short-term reduction in charges to extend through fiscal year 2022.Cost of Sales and Gross MarginTotal cost of sales of $7,209.3, including the facility closure discussed below, increased 23%, or $1,351.2. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of $479, higher costs associated with sales volumes of $433, unfavorable currency impacts of $233, and higher costs, including power and other cost inflation, of $183. Gross margin of 30.2% decreased 370 bp from 33.9% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, higher costs, and the reduced Lu'An contribution, partially offset by the positive impact of our pricing actions.Facility ClosureIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recorded a charge of $23.2 ($17.4 after-tax, or $0.08 per share) primarily for a noncash write-down of assets associated with a contract termination in the Industrial Gases – Americas segment. This charge is reflected as ""Facility closure"" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 and was not recorded in segment results.Selling and AdministrativeSelling and administrative expense of $828.4 increased 7%, or $52.5, primarily driven by higher spending for business development resources to support our growth strategy and unfavorable currency impacts. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 8.0% from 8.8% in the prior year.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense of $93.5 increased 11%, or $9.6, primarily due to higher product development costs in our Industrial Gases – Global segment. Research and development expense as a percentage of sales of 0.9% was flat versus the prior year.Gain on Exchange with Joint Venture PartnerIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recognized a gain of $36.8 ($27.3 after-tax, or $0.12 per share) on an exchange with the Tyczka Group, a former joint venture partner in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment. As part of the exchange, we separated our 50/50 joint venture in Germany into two separate businesses so each party could acquire a portion of the business on a 100% basis. The gain included $12.7 from the revaluation of our previously held equity interest in the portion of the business that we retained and $24.1 from the sale of our equity interest in the remaining business. The gain is reflected as ""Gain on exchange with joint venture partner"" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 and was not recorded in segment results. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Company Headquarters Relocation Income (Expense) In anticipation of relocating our U.S. headquarters, we sold property at our corporate headquarters located in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. We received net proceeds of $44.1 and recorded a gain of $33.8 ($25.6 after-tax, or $0.12 per share), which is reflected on our consolidated income statements as ""Company headquarters relocation income (expense)"" for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020. The gain was not recorded in the results of the Corporate and other segment.26Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), NetOther income of $52.8 decreased 19%, or $12.6. The prior year was favorably impacted by an adjustment for a benefit plan liability due to a change in plan terms. This impact was partially offset by the settlement of a supply contract in the current year.Operating Income and MarginOperating income of $2,281.4 increased 2%, or $43.8, as favorable currency of $96, positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $95, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner of $37 were partially offset by higher operating costs of $127, prior year income associated with the company headquarters relocation of $34, and a facility closure of $23. Despite higher sales volumes, the volume impact on operating income was minimal due to reduced contributions from Lu'An. Unfavorable operating costs were driven by the addition of resources to support our growth strategy and higher planned maintenance activities. Operating margin of 22.1% decreased 320 bp from 25.3% in the prior year, primarily due to the higher operating costs, higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which contributed to sales but not operating income, and reduced contributions from Lu'An, partially offset by positive pricing. The positive impact from a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner in the current year was offset by prior year income associated with the company headquarters relocation.Equity Affiliates’ IncomeEquity affiliates' income of $294.1 increased 11%, or $29.3. Higher income from affiliates in the regional segments was partially offset by a prior year benefit of $33.8 from the enactment of the India Finance Act 2020. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.We expect our equity affiliates' income to grow in future periods due to our investment in the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company joint venture.Interest ExpenseFiscal Year Ended 30 September20212020Interest incurred$170.1 $125.2 Less: Capitalized interest28.3 15.9 Interest expense$141.8 $109.3 Interest incurred increased 36%, or $44.9, primarily driven by a higher debt balance due to the issuance of U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Capitalized interest increased $12.4 due to a higher carrying value of projects under construction.Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), NetOther non-operating income of $73.7 increased $43.0. We recorded higher non-service pension income in 2021 due to lower interest costs and higher total assets, primarily for our U.S. pension plans. The current year also included favorable currency impacts. These factors were partially offset by lower interest income on cash and cash items due to lower interest rates.Discontinued OperationsIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $70.3 ($0.32 per share) for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021. This included net tax benefits of $60.0 recorded for the release of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, of which $51.8 ($0.23 per share) was recorded in the fourth quarter for liabilities associated with the 2017 sale of our former Performance Materials Division (""PMD"") and $8.2 was recorded in the third quarter for liabilities associated with our former Energy-from-Waste business. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit from discontinued operations of $10.3 in the first quarter, primarily from the settlement of a state tax appeal related to the gain on the sale of PMD.In fiscal year 2020, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $14.3 ($0.06 per share). This resulted from a pre-tax loss of $19.0 recorded in the second quarter to increase our existing liability for retained environmental obligations associated with the sale of our former Amines business in September 2006. Refer to the Pace discussion within Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information.27Table of ContentsNet Income and Net Income MarginNet income of $2,114.9, including income from discontinued operations discussed above, increased 10%, or $183.8. On a continuing operations basis, the increase was primarily driven by positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, favorable currency impacts, higher equity affiliates' income, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner, partially offset by unfavorable operating costs and a loss from a facility closure. In addition, less net income was attributable to noncontrolling interests, including our Lu'An joint venture partner, in the current year. The prior year included income associated with the company headquarters relocation and a net benefit from the India Finance Act 2020.Net income margin of 20.5% decreased 130 bp from 21.8% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which decreased margin by approximately 100 bp, and unfavorable net operating costs, partially offset by the impact from our pricing actions.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginAdjusted EBITDA of $3,883.2 increased 7%, or $263.4, primarily due to favorable currency impacts, positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, and higher equity affiliates' income, partially offset by unfavorable operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.6% decreased 330 bp from 40.9% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which decreased margin by approximately 200 bp, and the unfavorable net operating costs.Effective Tax RateOur effective tax rate was 18.5% and 19.7% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. The current year rate was lower primarily due to income tax benefits of $21.5 recorded upon expiration of the statute of limitations for tax reserves previously established for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years. This included a benefit of $12.2 ($0.05 per share) for release of reserves established in 2017 for a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary and other previously disclosed items (""tax election benefit and other""). Refer to Note 21 Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Additionally, the fiscal year 2020 effective tax rate reflected the unfavorable impact of India Finance Act 2020, which resulted in additional net income of $13.5 ($0.06 per share). This included an increase to equity affiliates' income of $33.8, partially offset by an increase to our income tax provision of $20.3 for changes in the future tax costs of repatriated earnings.The adjusted effective tax rate was 18.9% and 19.1% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Energy and natural gas cost pass through to customers was higher in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to natural gas prices, which rose significantly in the second quarter and remained elevated throughout the year. The pricing improvement was attributable to continued focus on pricing actions in our merchant business. Volumes were flat as positive contributions from new assets, including hydrogen assets we acquired in April 2020, were offset by lower hydrogen and merchant demand. Demand for most merchant products returned to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2021.Operating income of $1,065.5 increased 5%, or $53.1, due to higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $79 and favorable currency of $10, partially offset by higher operating costs, including planned maintenance, of $36. Operating margin of 25.6% decreased 230 bp from 27.9% in the prior year primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which negatively impacted margin by approximately 250 bp, and higher operating costs, partially offset by the impact of our pricing actions.Equity affiliates’ income of $112.5 increased 33%, or $28.2, primarily driven by higher income from affiliates in Mexico.Industrial Gases – EMEAFiscal Year Ended 30 September20212020$ ChangeChangeSales$2,444.9$1,926.3$518.6 27 %Operating income557.4473.384.1 18 %Operating margin22.8 %24.6 %(180) bpEquity affiliates’ income$93.7$74.818.9 25 %Adjusted EBITDA880.9744.0136.9 18 %Adjusted EBITDA margin36.0 %38.6 %(260) bpSales % Change from Prior YearVolume12 %Price3 %Energy and natural gas cost pass-through5 %Currency7 %Total Industrial Gases – EMEA Sales Change27 %Sales of $2,444.9 increased 27%, or $518.6, due to higher volumes of 12%, favorable currency impacts of 7%, higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 5%, and positive pricing of 3%. The volume improvement was primarily driven by our base merchant business and new assets, including those from a business in Israel that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020. While our liquid bulk business has largely recovered from COVID-19, demand for packaged gases and hydrogen continues to be lower than pre-pandemic levels. Favorable currency impacts were primarily driven by the appreciation of the British Pound Sterling and Euro against the U.S. Dollar. Energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers was higher primarily in the second half of the year as we experienced significantly higher natural gas and electricity costs in Europe. The pricing improvement was primarily attributable to our merchant business.Operating income of $557.4 increased 18%, or $84.1, due to higher volumes of $59, favorable currency impacts of $31, and positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $11, partially offset by unfavorable costs of $17. Operating margin of 22.8% decreased 180 bp from 24.6% in the prior year, primarily due to impacts from higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which negatively impacted margin by approximately 100 bp, and unfavorable operating costs.Equity affiliates’ income of $93.7 increased 25%, or $18.9, primarily due to higher income from affiliates in Italy, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.29Table of ContentsIndustrial Gases – AsiaFiscal Year Ended 30 September20212020$ ChangeChangeSales$2,920.8$2,716.5$204.3 8 %Operating income838.3870.3(32.0)(4 %)Operating margin28.7 %32.0 %(330) bpEquity affiliates’ income$81.4$61.020.4 33 %Adjusted EBITDA1,364.11,330.733.4 3 %Adjusted EBITDA margin46.7 %49.0 %(230) bpSales % Change from Prior YearVolume— %Price1 %Energy and natural gas cost pass-through— %Currency7 %Total Industrial Gases – Asia Sales Change8 %Sales of $2,920.8 increased 8%, or $204.3, due to favorable currency of 7% and positive pricing of 1%, as both volumes and energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers were flat.

On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or ""non-GAAP adjustments,"" have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our business because such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.31Table of ContentsAdjusted Diluted EPSThe table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. The per share impact for each non-GAAP adjustment was calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.Fiscal Year Ended 30 SeptemberOperating IncomeEquity Affiliates' IncomeIncome Tax ProvisionNet Income Attributable to Air ProductsDiluted EPS2021 GAAP$2,281.4 $294.1 $462.8 $2,028.8 $9.12 2020 GAAP2,237.6 264.8 478.4 1,901.0 8.55 Change GAAP$0.57 % Change GAAP7 %2021 GAAP$2,281.4 $294.1 $462.8 $2,028.8 $9.12 Facility closure23.2 — 5.8 17.4 0.08 Gain on exchange with joint venture partner(36.8)— (9.5)(27.3)(0.12)Tax election benefit and other— — 12.2 (12.2)(0.05)2021 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$2,267.8 $294.1 $471.3 $2,006.7 $9.02 2020 GAAP$2,237.6 $264.8 $478.4 $1,901.0 $8.55 Company headquarters relocation (income) expense(33.8)— (8.2)(25.6)(0.12)India Finance Act 2020— (33.8)(20.3)(13.5)(0.06)2020 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$2,203.8 $231.0 $449.9 $1,861.9 $8.38 Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$0.64 % Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")8 %32Table of ContentsAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance. Margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding.

In addition, we have the flexibility to access capital through a variety of financing activities, including accessing the capital markets, drawing upon our credit facility, or alternatively, accessing the commercial paper markets. At this time, we have not utilized, nor do we expect to access, our credit facility for additional liquidity. In addition, we have considered the impacts of COVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources and do not expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs.As of 30 September 2021, we had $1,590.4 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of $4,468.9. We do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. Depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the U.S.Cash Flows From OperationsFiscal Year Ended 30 September20212020Income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products$2,028.8 $1,901.0 Adjustments to reconcile income to cash provided by operating activities:Depreciation and amortization1,321.3 1,185.0 Deferred income taxes94.0 165.0 Facility closure23.2 — Undistributed earnings of equity method investments(138.2)(161.9)Gain on sale of assets and investments(37.2)(45.8)Share-based compensation44.5 53.5 Noncurrent lease receivables98.8 91.6 Other adjustments(116.7)116.4 Changes in working capital accounts16.7 (40.1)Cash Provided by Operating Activities$3,335.2 $3,264.7 For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $3,335.2. Other adjustments of $116.7 included pension plan contributions of $44.6 and pension income of $38.9 that did not have a cash impact. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $16.7, primarily driven by a $187.9 source of cash from payables and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $130.5 use of cash from trade receivables, less allowances. The source of cash within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs, which also drove the use of cash within trade receivables as we contractually passed through these higher costs to customers.36Table of ContentsFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $3,264.7. We recorded a net benefit of $13.5 on our consolidated income statements related to a recently enacted tax law in India during the second quarter. This net benefit, which is further discussed in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements, increased ""Undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates"" by $33.8 and increased ""Deferred income taxes"" by $20.3. The ""Gain on sale of assets and investments"" of $45.8 includes a gain of $33.8 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters. Refer to Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $40.1, primarily driven by other working capital uses of $130.6, partially offset by a source of $84.4 from other receivables. The use of cash within ""Other working capital"" was primarily due to timing of tax payments and a tax benefit as a result of the assets acquired in April 2020 from PBF Energy Inc. The source of cash within ""Other receivables"" was primarily driven by maturities of forward exchange contracts.Cash Flows From Investing ActivitiesFiscal Year Ended 30 September20212020Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits($2,464.2)($2,509.0)Acquisitions, less cash acquired(10.5)(183.3)Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates(76.0)(24.4)Proceeds from sale of assets and investments37.5 80.3 Purchases of investments(2,100.7)(2,865.5)Proceeds from investments1,875.2 1,938.0 Other investing activities5.8 3.9 Cash Used for Investing Activities($2,732.9)($3,560.0)For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, cash used for investing activities was $2,732.9. Capital expenditures for plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,464.2. Purchases of investments with terms greater than three months but less than one year of $2,100.7 exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,875.2, which resulted from maturities of time deposits and treasury securities.For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020, cash used for investing activities was $3,560.0. Payments for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,509.0. This includes the acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from PBF Energy Inc. in Delaware and California for approximately $580. Additionally, acquisitions, less cash acquired, includes $183.3 for three businesses we acquired on 1 July 2020, the largest of which was a business in Israel that primarily offers merchant gas products. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Purchases of investments of $2,865.5 related to time deposits and treasury securities with terms greater than three months and less than one year and exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,938.0. Proceeds from sale of assets and investments of $80.3 included net proceeds of $44.1 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below. We present a reconciliation of our capital expenditures to cash used for investing activities on page 36.Fiscal Year Ended 30 September20212020Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits$2,464.2 $2,509.0 Acquisitions, less cash acquired10.5 183.3 Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates76.0 24.4 Capital Expenditures$2,550.7 $2,716.7 Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2021 totaled $2,550.7 compared to $2,716.7 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease of $166.0 was primarily driven by the prior year acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from PBF, partially offset by lower spending for acquisitions. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements.37Table of ContentsOutlook for Investing ActivitiesWe expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 to be approximately $4.5 to $5 billion. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we paid $1.6 billion, including approximately $130 from a non-controlling partner in one of our subsidiaries, for the initial investment in the Jazan gasification and power project. We expect to make an additional investment of approximately $1 billion, which includes contribution from our non-controlling partner, for phase II of the project in 2023. Refer to Note 24, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.We anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate (1) acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; (2) purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and (3) investment in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.Cash Flows From Financing ActivitiesFiscal Year Ended 30 September20212020Long-term debt proceeds$178.9 $4,895.8 Payments on long-term debt(462.9)(406.6)Net increase (decrease) in commercial paper and short-term borrowings1.0 (54.9)Dividends paid to shareholders(1,256.7)(1,103.6)Proceeds from stock option exercises 10.6 34.1 Investments by noncontrolling interests136.6 17.1 Other financing activities(28.4)(97.2)Cash (Used for) Provided by Financing Activities($1,420.9)$3,284.7 In fiscal year 2021, cash used for financing activities was $1,420.9 and primarily included dividend payments to shareholders of $1,256.7 and payments on long-term debt of $462.9, partially offset by long-term debt proceeds of $178.9 and investments by noncontrolling interests of $136.6. The payments on long-term debt included the repayment of a €350.0 million Eurobond ($428) in June 2021.In November 2021, we repaid our 3.0% Senior Note of $400, plus interest, on its maturity date.In fiscal year 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $3,284.7 as we successfully accessed the debt markets in April 2020 to support opportunities for growth projects and repay upcoming debt maturities. Long-term debt proceeds of $4,895.8 were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of $1,103.6 and payments on long-term debt of $406.6 primarily related to the repayment of a 2.0% Eurobond of €300.0 million ($353.9) that matured on 7 August 2020. Other financing activities were a use of cash of $97.2 and included financing charges associated with the third quarter debt issuance.Financing and Capital StructureCapital needs in fiscal year 2021 were satisfied with cash from operations. Total debt decreased from $7,907.8 as of 30 September 2020 to $7,637.2 as of 30 September 2021, primarily due to repayment of the €350 million Eurobond, partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings on our foreign commitments. Total debt includes related party debt of $358.4 and $338.5 as of 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020, respectively, primarily associated with the Lu'An joint venture. For additional detail, refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements. 38Table of ContentsOn 31 March 2021, we entered into a five-year $2,500 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “2021 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. The only financial covenant in the 2021 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to capitalization (equal to total debt plus total equity) not to exceed 70%. Total debt as of 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization, was 35.2% and 38.9%, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2021.The 2021 Credit Agreement replaced our previous five-year $2,300.0 revolving credit agreement, which was to have matured on 31 March 2022. No borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement as of 30 September 2020 or at the time of its termination. No early termination penalties were incurred.Commitments of $296.7 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, $176.2 of which was borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2021.As of 30 September 2021, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares in fiscal years 2021 or 2020. As of 30 September 2021, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.DividendsCash dividends on our common stock are paid quarterly, usually during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future at comparable or increased levels.The Board of Directors determines whether to declare dividends and the timing and amount based on financial condition and other factors it deems relevant. In 2021, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.50 per share, representing a 12% increase from the previous dividend of $1.34 per share. This is the 39th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.On 18 November 2021, the Board of Directors declared the first quarter 2022 dividend of $1.50 per share. The dividend is payable on 14 February 2022 to shareholders of record as of 3 January 2022.Discontinued OperationsIn fiscal year 2021, cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of $6.7 resulted from cash received as part of a state tax settlement related to the sale of PMD in fiscal year 2017.PENSION BENEFITSWe and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.The fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2021 measurement date increased to $5,248.7 from $4,775.1 at the end of fiscal year 2020. The projected benefit obligation for these plans was $5,304.9 and $5,373.5 at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net unfunded liability decreased $542.2 from $598.4 to $56.2, primarily due to favorable asset experience. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits.39Table of ContentsPension Expense20212020Pension (income)/expense, including special items noted below($37.3)$7.0 Settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments (""special items"")1.8 5.2 Weighted average discount rate – Service cost2.3 %2.4 %Weighted average discount rate – Interest cost 1.8 %2.3 %Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets6.0 %6.3 %Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase3.4 %3.4 %We recognized pension income of $37.3 in fiscal year 2021 versus expense of $7.0 in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to lower interest cost and higher total assets. Special items decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses.2022 OutlookIn fiscal year 2022, we expect pension impacts to range from $5 million of income to $5 million of expense, which includes potential settlement losses of $5 to $10 million, depending on the timing of retirements. This forecast reflects a lower expected estimated return on assets due to the increased percentage of fixed income investments within the plan asset portfolios and higher interest cost, partially offset by lower forecasted actuarial loss amortization. In fiscal year 2022, our expected range of pension impacts includes approximately $80 for amortization of actuarial losses.In fiscal year 2021, pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $97.8. Net actuarial gains of $360.8 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2021. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets could impact the actuarial gain or loss and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2022.Pension FundingPension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2021 and 2020, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $44.6 and $37.5, respectively.For fiscal year 2022, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $40 to $50. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. We do not expect COVID-19 to impact our contribution forecast for fiscal year 2022.40Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESRefer to Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.The accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current and/or future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. If conditions change, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors.Depreciable Lives of Plant and EquipmentPlant and equipment, net at 30 September 2021 totaled $13,254.6, and depreciation expense totaled $1,284.1 during fiscal year 2021. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business circumstances change. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.The regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.Our regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. In addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. 41Table of ContentsImpairment of AssetsAs discussed below, there were no triggering events in fiscal year 2021 that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups, reporting units that contain goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles assets, or equity method investments. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment.Impairment of Assets – Plant and EquipmentPlant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include: (1) a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping; (2) a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition; (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset; (4) a reduction in revenues that is other than temporary; (5) a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping; or (6) changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.In fiscal year 2021, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of our asset groupings may not be recoverable.Impairment of Assets – GoodwillThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $911.5 as of 30 September 2021. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 9, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five reportable business segments, seven operating segments and ten reporting units, seven of which include a goodwill balance. Refer to Note 23, Business Segment and Geographic Information, for additional information. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional Industrial Gases segments.As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. However, we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 42Table of ContentsTo determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test, noting no indications of impairment. The fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.Due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 October 2021, we conducted an additional impairment test on our existing reporting units as of 30 September 2021. The fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 September 2021.Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, changes in the strategy of the reporting unit, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.Impairment of Assets – Intangible AssetsIntangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 September 2021 totaled $380.4 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under ""Impairment of Assets – Plant and Equipment"" for a description of how impairment losses are determined.Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2021 totaled $40.3 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.Disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 10, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements.In the fourth quarter of 2021, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles which resulted in no impairment.43Table of ContentsImpairment of Assets – Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,649.3 at 30 September 2021. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 7, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.An impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. We utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach. For the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.In fiscal year 2021, there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment, as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.Revenue Recognition – Cost Incurred Input MethodRevenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule delays, technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.In addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities, our sale of equipment projects within our Industrial Gases – Global segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $19 in fiscal year 2021 as compared to a favorable impact of $7 in fiscal year 2020. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years. We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.Revenue Recognition – On-site Customer ContractsFor customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities. Certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition. 44Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As of 30 September 2021, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded as noncurrent, was $251.0, and net deferred tax liabilities were $1,080.7. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2021 were $140.3, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 was $462.8. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.A 1% increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of approximately $25.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions, expense, and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans.Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. We measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $20 per year.45Table of ContentsThe expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $23 per year.We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $7 per year.Loss ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the liability increases. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties; interest rate swaps; cross currency interest rate swaps; and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the ""net financial instrument position"" and is disclosed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. 46Table of ContentsOur net financial instrument position decreased from a liability of $8,220.7 at 30 September 2020 to a liability of $7,850.3 at 30 September 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of a €350.0 million Eurobond ($428) on its maturity date in June 2021. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date, such as interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities.Interest Rate RiskOur debt portfolio as of 30 September 2021 and 2020, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 89% fixed-rate debt and 11% variable-rate debt.The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2021, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $587 and $711 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $692 and $846 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $8 of interest incurred per year at 30 September 2021 and 2020. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $8 per year at 30 September 2021 and 2020.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2021 and 2020, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $343 and $360 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.The majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the United States. Therefore, financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $45 and $25, respectively.47Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:11.307222

Our ability to complete the project and recover the carrying value of the assets, which was approximately $45 as of 30 September 2022, could be impacted by future events. Annual sales generated from our business in Ukraine were less than $5 in our Europe segment.21Table of ContentsBUSINESS OVERVIEWAir Products and Chemicals, Inc., a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1940, has built a reputation for its innovative culture, operational excellence, and commitment to safety and the environment. Our passionate, talented, and committed employees are from diverse backgrounds, but are driven by our higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability, and address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world.We offer a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, equipment, and related services. Focused on energy, environmental, and emerging markets, we serve customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, medical, and food. Our gases, equipment, and applications expertise enable our customers to improve their sustainability performance by increasing productivity, producing better quality products, reducing energy use, and lowering emissions. We also develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world's largest industrial gas and carbon-capture projects, supplying clean hydrogen that will support global transportation, industrial markets, and the broader energy transition away from fossil fuels. We have built leading positions in several growth markets, such as hydrogen, helium, and liquefied natural gas (""LNG"") process technology and equipment, and provide turbomachinery, membrane systems, and cryogenic containers globally.With operations in over 50 countries, in fiscal year 2022 we had sales of $12.7 billion and assets of $27.2 billion. During the fiscal year ended 30 September 2022, we managed our operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings under the following five reporting segments: •Americas;•Asia;•Europe;•Middle East and India; and•Corporate and otherThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis discusses our results based on these operations. Refer to Note 23, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.2022 IN SUMMARYOur fiscal year 2022 results demonstrate our employees' commitment to excellence and service to our customers as our earnings grew despite economic headwinds. Our on-site business continued to provide stable cash flow due to the structure of our contracts, which generally contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements. These contracts also protected us from energy price fluctuations, particularly in Europe, due to pass-through provisions that allow us to recover the cost of energy. Our merchant business also successfully implemented pricing actions to recover higher costs, including soaring energy prices, in our three largest regional segments and across most major product lines. We also made progress on our growth strategy, including completion of an initial investment in the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company (""JIGPC"") joint venture. JIGPC acquired the first phase of assets for the gasification and power project and began contributing to our results through equity affiliates' income in late October 2021.We shared the cash flows generated during fiscal year 2022 with our investors by increasing the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.62 per share, representing an 8% increase, or $0.12 per share, from the previous dividend of $1.50 per share. This is the 40th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend.22Table of ContentsFiscal Year 2022 Highlights•Sales of $12,698.6 increased 23%, or $2,375.6, due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 13%, higher volumes of 8%, and higher pricing of 6%, partially offset by unfavorable currency of 4% due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar. Volume growth was driven by recovery in hydrogen, new assets, better merchant demand, and higher sale of equipment project activity. In our merchant business, we successfully implemented pricing actions across the regional segments, particularly in Europe, to offset unprecedented power and fuel costs. •Operating income of $2,338.8 increased 3%, or $57.4, as our pricing actions and higher volumes overcame unfavorable costs, including the loss on the divestiture of our Russia business, and currency. Operating margin of 18.4% decreased 370 basis points (bp) from the prior year, primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers and unfavorable costs.•Equity affiliates' income of $481.5 increased 64%, or $187.4, driven by the JIGPC joint venture. JIGPC began contributing to our results in the Middle East and India segment in late October 2021.•Net income of $2,266.5 increased 7%, or $151.6, primarily due to higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, higher volumes, and higher equity affiliates' income driven by JIGPC, partially offset by higher costs. Net income margin of 17.8% decreased 270 bp, primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers, as unfavorable costs offset the impact of higher equity affiliates' income.•Adjusted EBITDA of $4,247.0 increased 9%, or $363.8, while adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.4% decreased 420 bp.•Diluted EPS of $10.08 increased 11%, or $0.96 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS of $10.41 increased 15%, or $1.39 per share.

While global economic challenges are likely to continue in fiscal year 2023, we remain focused on pricing actions to recover higher energy costs in our merchant business, pursuing additional volume opportunities, and closely monitoring our costs. We expect our onsite business model, which has contractual protection from energy cost fluctuations, to continue providing stable cash flow. This business consistently generates approximately half our total company sales. Further, we expect several new projects to contribute to our results in 2023, including the second phase of JIGPC's gasification and power project that we expect to commence in the second quarter.Sustainability is our growth strategy at Air Products, and we have the financial capacity to support our zero- and low-carbon hydrogen projects. We believe there will be additional opportunities for clean hydrogen and carbon capture technologies, which are further supported by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that was enacted in August. We anticipate benefits from tax incentives for carbon sequestration and clean hydrogen production in future years once our new projects in these areas come on-stream in the U.S. We continue to evaluate the impact this act could have on our business.

Energy costs were significantly higher versus the prior year, particularly in Europe and the Americas. Contractual provisions associated with our on-site business, which generates approximately half our total company sales, allow us to pass the higher energy costs through to our customers. Volume growth was driven by recovery in hydrogen, new assets, better merchant demand, and higher sale of equipment project activity. Continued focus on pricing actions in our merchant businesses, including those intended to recover escalating power and fuel costs, resulted in price improvement in our three largest segments. Currency was unfavorable as the U.S. Dollar strengthened against most major currencies.2021 vs. 2020Sales of $10,323.0 increased 17%, or $1,466.7, due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 6%, higher volumes of 5%, favorable currency impacts of 4%, and positive pricing of 2%. We experienced significantly higher energy costs in the second half of fiscal year 2021, particularly in North America and Europe, which were passed to our on-site customers. Positive volumes from new assets, our sale of equipment businesses, and merchant demand recovery from COVID-19 were partially offset by reduced contributions from our gasification joint venture with Lu'An Clean Energy Company. Favorable currency was driven by the appreciation of the British Pound Sterling, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, and South Korean Won against the U.S. Dollar. Continued focus on pricing actions, including energy cost recovery, in our merchant businesses resulted in price improvement in the Americas, Asia, and Europe segments.Cost of Sales and Gross Margin2022 vs. 2021Cost of sales of $9,338.5 increased 30%, or $2,129.2, from total cost of sales of $7,209.3 in the prior year, which included a charge of $23.2 for a facility closure as discussed below. The increase was due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers of $1,263, unfavorable costs of $617, and higher costs associated with sales volumes of $575, partially offset by favorable currency impacts of $302. The unfavorable cost impact was driven by power for our merchant business, higher planned maintenance, inflation, and supply chain challenges. Additionally, we also incurred higher costs to support long-term growth, such as costs for resources needed to bring projects on-stream as well as costs for a helium storage cavern to support reliable helium supply to our customers globally. Gross margin of 26.5% decreased 370 bp from 30.2% in the prior year, primarily due to the unfavorable costs and higher energy cost pass-through to customers, partially offset by the positive impact of our pricing actions.2021 vs. 2020Total cost of sales of $7,209.3, including the facility closure discussed below, increased 23%, or $1,351.2. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers of $479, higher costs associated with sales volumes of $433, unfavorable currency impacts of $233, and higher costs, including power and other cost inflation, of $183. Gross margin of 30.2% decreased 370 bp from 33.9% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers, higher costs, and a reduced contribution from our Lu'An joint venture, partially offset by the positive impact of our pricing actions.Facility ClosureDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recorded a charge of $23.2 ($17.4 after-tax, or $0.08 per share) primarily for a noncash write-down of assets associated with a contract termination in the Americas segment. This charge is reflected as ""Facility closure"" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 and was not recorded in segment results.26Table of ContentsSelling and Administrative2022 vs. 2021Selling and administrative expense of $900.6 increased 9%, or $72.2, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, depreciation expense associated with our new global headquarters, inflation, and increased headcount to support our growth strategy, partially offset by a favorable currency impact from the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 7.1% from 8.0% in the prior year.2021 vs. 2020Selling and administrative expense of $828.4 increased 7%, or $52.5, primarily due to higher spending for business development resources to support our growth strategy and unfavorable currency impacts. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 8.0% in fiscal year 2021 from 8.8% in fiscal year 2020.Research and Development2022 vs. 2021Research and development expense of $102.9 increased 10%, or $9.4. Research and development expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 0.8% from 0.9% in the prior year.2021 vs. 2020Research and development expense of $93.5 increased 11%, or $9.6. Research and development expense as a percentage of sales of 0.9% was flat versus fiscal year 2020.Business and Asset ActionsDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we divested our small industrial gas business in Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a result, we recorded a noncash charge of $73.7 ($61.0 after tax, or $0.27 per share), which included transaction costs and cumulative currency translation losses. This charge is reflected as ""Business and asset actions"" on our consolidated income statement for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2022 and was not recorded in segment results.Gain On Exchange With Joint Venture PartnerIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recognized a gain of $36.8 ($27.3 after-tax, or $0.12 per share) on an exchange with the Tyczka Group, a former joint venture partner. As part of the exchange, we separated our 50/50 joint venture in Germany into two separate businesses so each party could acquire a portion of the business on a 100% basis. The gain included $12.7 from the revaluation of our previously held equity interest in the portion of the business that we retained and $24.1 from the sale of our interest in the remaining business. The gain is reflected as ""Gain on exchange with joint venture partner"" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 and was not recorded in segment results. Refer to Note 3, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Company Headquarters Relocation Income In 2020, we sold property at our former corporate headquarters located in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania. We received net proceeds of $44.1 and recorded a gain of $33.8 ($25.6 after-tax, or $0.12 per share), which is reflected on our consolidated income statements as ""Company headquarters relocation income (expense)"" for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020. The gain was not recorded in segment results.Other Income (Expense), Net2022 vs. 2021Other income of $55.9 increased 6%, or $3.1, as higher income from the sale of assets in fiscal year 2022 was partially offset by a prior year settlement of a supply contract.2021 vs. 2020Other income of $52.8 decreased 19%, or $12.6. Fiscal year 2020 was favorably impacted by an adjustment for a benefit plan liability due to a change in plan terms. This impact was partially offset by the settlement of a supply contract in fiscal year 2021.27Table of ContentsOperating Income and Margin2022 vs. 2021Operating income of $2,338.8 increased 3%, or $57.4, as positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $222 and higher volumes of $218 were partially offset by higher costs of $229 and an unfavorable currency impact of $66. Higher costs were primarily attributable to operating and distribution costs driven by higher planned maintenance and various external factors, including inflation and supply chain challenges, as well as higher incentive compensation. Additionally, we incurred higher costs in the current year to support long-term growth, such as costs for resources needed to bring projects on-stream. In fiscal year 2022, we also recorded a charge of $74 for business and asset actions associated with the divestiture of our Russia business. The prior year included a gain of $37 on an exchange with a joint venture partner and a charge of $23 associated with a facility closure.Operating margin of 18.4% decreased 370 bp from 22.1% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers and unfavorable costs.2021 vs. 2020Operating income of $2,281.4 increased 2%, or $43.8, as favorable currency of $96, positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $95, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner of $37 were partially offset by higher operating costs of $127 and a facility closure of $23. Additionally, fiscal year 2020 included income of $34 associated with our company headquarters relocation. Despite higher sales volumes, the volume impact on operating income was minimal due to a reduced contribution from our Lu'An joint venture in fiscal year 2021. Unfavorable operating costs were driven by the addition of resources to support our growth strategy and higher planned maintenance activities.Operating margin of 22.1% decreased 320 bp from 25.3% in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to the higher operating costs, higher energy cost pass-through to customers and the reduced contribution from our Lu'An joint venture, partially offset by positive pricing. The positive impact from a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner in 2021 was offset by income in fiscal year 2020 associated with the company headquarters relocation.Equity Affiliates’ Income2022 vs. 2021Equity affiliates' income of $481.5 increased 64%, or $187.4, driven by the JIGPC joint venture, which began contributing to our results in the Middle East and India segment in late October 2021. In the first quarter, we also recognized the remaining deferred profit associated with air separation units previously sold to Jazan Gas Project Company, net of other project finalization costs. These factors were partially offset by an impairment charge of $14.8 ($11.1 after tax, or $0.05 per share) related to two small affiliates in the Asia segment and lower contributions from several affiliates in our regional segments.For additional information on our equity affiliates, refer to Note 7, Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements.2021 vs. 2020Equity affiliates' income of $294.1 increased 11%, or $29.3. Higher income from affiliates in the regional segments was partially offset by a benefit of $33.8 in fiscal year 2020 from the enactment of the India Finance Act 2020. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.28Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseFiscal Year Ended 30 September202220212020Interest incurred$169.0 $170.1 $125.2 Less: Capitalized interest41.0 28.3 15.9 Interest expense$128.0 $141.8 $109.3 2022 vs. 2021Interest incurred decreased 1%, or $1.1, as the impacts of a lower debt balance and currency were mostly offset by a higher average interest rate on the debt portfolio. Capitalized interest increased 45%, or $12.7, due to a higher carrying value of projects under construction.2021 vs. 2020Interest incurred increased 36%, or $44.9, driven by a higher debt balance due to the issuance of U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Capitalized interest increased $12.4 due to a higher carrying value of projects under construction.Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net2022 vs. 2021Other non-operating income of $62.4 decreased 15%, or $11.3. Non-service pension income decreased $38 primarily due to lower expected returns on plan assets for the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. This impact was partially offset by higher interest income on cash and cash items due to higher interest rates and lower expense for excluded components of cash flow hedges of intercompany loans.2021 vs. 2020Other non-operating income of $73.7 increased $43.0. We recorded higher non-service pension income in 2021 due to lower interest costs and higher total assets, primarily for our U.S. pension plans. Fiscal year 2021 also included favorable currency impacts. These factors were partially offset by lower interest income on cash and cash items due to lower interest rates.Discontinued OperationsIn fiscal year 2022, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $12.6 ($0.06 per share). This primarily resulted from a net tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter upon release of tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions associated with our former Performance Materials Division (""PMD"") for which the statute of limitations expired. In fiscal year 2021, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $70.3 ($0.32 per share). This included net tax benefits of $60.0 recorded for the release of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, of which $51.8 ($0.23 per share) was recorded in the fourth quarter for liabilities associated with the 2017 sale of PMD and $8.2 was recorded in the third quarter for liabilities associated with our former Energy-from-Waste business. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit from discontinued operations of $10.3 in the first quarter, primarily from the settlement of a state tax appeal related to the gain on the sale of PMD.In fiscal year 2020, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $14.3 ($0.06 per share). This resulted from a pre-tax loss of $19.0 recorded in the second quarter to increase our existing liability for retained environmental obligations associated with the sale of our former Amines business in September 2006. Refer to the Pace discussion within Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information.29Table of ContentsNet Income and Net Income Margin2022 vs. 2021Net income of $2,266.5 increased 7%, or $151.6, primarily due to higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, higher volumes, and higher equity affiliates' income driven by JIGPC, partially offset by higher costs, including charges for business and asset actions and the equity affiliate impairment, and unfavorable currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the prior year included higher net income from discontinued operations.Net income margin of 17.8% decreased 270 bp from 20.5% in the prior year primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers as the impact of higher equity affiliates' income was offset by unfavorable costs. Higher energy cost pass-through to customers accounted for approximately 200 bp of the decline.2021 vs. 2020Net income of $2,114.9 increased 10%, or $183.8. As discussed above, fiscal year 2021 included higher net income from discontinued operations. On a continuing operations basis, the increase was driven by positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, favorable currency impacts, higher equity affiliates' income, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner, partially offset by unfavorable operating costs and a loss from a facility closure. Additionally, less net income was attributable to noncontrolling interests, including our Lu'An joint venture partner. Fiscal year 2020 also included income associated with the company headquarters relocation and a net benefit from the India Finance Act 2020.Net income margin of 20.5% decreased 130 bp from 21.8% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which decreased margin by approximately 100 bp, and unfavorable net operating costs, partially offset by the impact from our pricing actions.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin2022 vs. 2021Adjusted EBITDA of $4,247.0 increased 9%, or $363.8, primarily due to higher volumes, higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, and higher equity affiliates' income, partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable currency. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.4% decreased 420 bp from 37.6% in the prior year primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers as the impact of higher equity affiliates' income was offset by unfavorable costs. Higher energy cost pass-through to customers accounted for approximately 400 bp of the decline.2021 vs. 2020Adjusted EBITDA of $3,883.2 increased 7%, or $263.4, primarily due to favorable currency impacts, positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, and higher equity affiliates' income, partially offset by unfavorable operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.6% decreased 330 bp from 40.9% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which decreased margin by approximately 200 bp, and the unfavorable net operating costs.Effective Tax RateThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate.2022 vs. 2021Our effective tax rate was 18.2% and 18.5% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2022 and 2021, respectively. The current year reflects a favorable effective tax rate impact from higher equity affiliates' income, which is primarily presented net of income taxes within income from continuing operations on our consolidated income statements. The higher equity affiliates' income was driven by the JIGPC joint venture, which began contributing to our results in late October 2021. The prior year included a tax benefit of $21.5 from the release of tax reserves established for uncertain tax positions. This included a benefit of $12.2 ($0.05 per share) for the release of reserves established in 2017 for a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary and other previously disclosed items (""tax election benefit and other"").Our adjusted effective tax rate was 18.2% and 18.9% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2022 and 2021, respectively. 30Table of Contents2021 vs. 2020Our effective tax rate was 18.5% and 19.7% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fiscal year 2021 rate was lower primarily due to income tax benefits of $21.5 recorded upon expiration of the statute of limitations for tax reserves previously established for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years. This included a benefit of $12.2 ($0.05 per share) for release of reserves established in 2017 for a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary and other previously disclosed items (""tax election benefit and other"").Additionally, the fiscal year 2020 effective tax rate reflected the unfavorable impact of India Finance Act 2020, which resulted in additional net income of $13.5 ($0.06 per share). This included an increase to equity affiliates' income of $33.8, partially offset by an increase to our income tax provision of $20.3 for changes in the future tax costs of repatriated earnings.Our adjusted effective tax rate was 18.9% and 19.1% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.DISCUSSION OF RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENTPrior year segment information presented below has been updated to reflect the reorganization of our reporting segments effective 1 October 2021. The reorganization included the separation of our former Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) segment into two separate reporting segments: (1) Europe and (2) Middle East and India. The results of an affiliate formerly reflected in the Asia segment are now reported in the Middle East and India segment. Additionally, the results of our Industrial Gases – Global operating segment are reflected in the Corporate and other segment. The reorganization did not impact the Americas segment.AmericasFiscal Year Ended 30 September2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020202220212020$%/bp$%/bpSales$5,368.9$4,167.6$3,630.7$1,201.3 29 %$536.9 15 %Operating income1,174.41,065.51,012.4108.9 10 %53.1 5 %Operating margin21.9 %25.6 %27.9 %(370) bp(230) bpEquity affiliates’ income$98.2$112.5$84.3(14.3)(13 %)28.2 33 %Adjusted EBITDA1,902.11,789.91,656.2112.2 6 %133.7 8 %Adjusted EBITDA margin35.4 %42.9 %45.6 %(750) bp(270) bpThe table below summarizes the major factors that impacted sales in the Americas segment for the periods presented:2022vs. 20212021vs. 2020Volume8 %— %Price6 %4 %Energy cost pass-through to customers16 %11 %Currency(1 %)— %Total Americas Sales Change29 %15 %2022 vs. 2021 (Americas)Sales of $5,368.9 increased 29%, or $1,201.3, due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 16%, higher volumes of 8%, and positive pricing of 6%, partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 1%. Significantly higher energy costs increased contractual cost pass-through to our on-site customers. In our merchant business, we successfully implemented pricing actions across all major product lines. The volume improvement was driven by a recovery in hydrogen and better demand for merchant products in North America. The unfavorable currency impact was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Chilean Peso.31Table of ContentsOperating income of $1,174.4 increased 10%, or $108.9, primarily from pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $146 and favorable volumes of $68, partially offset by higher costs of $100. Higher costs were driven by supply chain challenges, including driver shortages that continue to impact the industry broadly, inflation, higher planned maintenance, and higher incentive compensation. Operating margin of 21.9% decreased 370 bp from 25.6% in the prior year, as higher energy cost pass-through to customers and higher costs were only partially offset by higher pricing. The higher energy cost pass-through to customers accounted for approximately 300 bp of the decline.Equity affiliates’ income of $98.2 decreased 13%, or $14.3, driven by our Mexico affiliate.2021 vs. 2020 (Americas)Sales of $4,167.6 increased 15%, or $536.9, due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 11% and positive pricing of 4%, as volumes and currency were flat versus the prior year. Energy cost pass-through to customers was higher in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to natural gas prices, which rose significantly in the second quarter and remained elevated throughout the year. The pricing improvement was attributable to continued focus on pricing actions in our merchant business. Volumes were flat as positive contributions from new assets, including hydrogen assets we acquired in April 2020, were offset by lower hydrogen and merchant demand. Operating income of $1,065.5 increased 5%, or $53.1, due to higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $79 and favorable currency of $10, partially offset by higher operating costs, including planned maintenance, of $36. Operating margin of 25.6% decreased 230 bp from 27.9% in 2020 primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers, which negatively impacted margin by approximately 250 bp, and higher operating costs, partially offset by the impact of our pricing actions.Equity affiliates’ income of $112.5 increased 33%, or $28.2, driven by higher income from our Mexico affiliate.AsiaFiscal Year Ended 30 September2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020202220212020$%/bp$%/bpSales$3,143.3$2,920.8$2,716.5$222.5 8 %$204.3 8 %Operating income898.3838.3870.360.0 7 %(32.0)(4 %)Operating margin28.6 %28.7 %32.0 %(10) bp(330) bpEquity affiliates’ income$22.1$35.9$32.1(13.8)(38 %)3.8 12 %Adjusted EBITDA1,356.91,318.61,301.838.3 3 %16.8 1 %Adjusted EBITDA margin43.2 %45.1 %47.9 %(190) bp(280) bpThe table below summarizes the major factors that impacted sales in the Asia segment for the periods presented:2022vs. 20212021vs. 2020Volume7 %— %Price3 %1 %Energy cost pass-through to customers1 %— %Currency(3 %)7 %Total Asia Sales Change8 %8 %32Table of Contents2022 vs. 2021 (Asia)Sales of $3,143.3 increased 8%, or $222.5, due to higher volumes of 7%, positive pricing of 3%, and higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 1%, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 3%. Volumes improved overall despite COVID-19 restrictions in certain parts of China and included contributions from several traditional industrial gas plants that were brought on-stream in our on-site business across the region. Pricing improved across all key countries and most major merchant product lines. The unfavorable currency impact was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Chinese Renminbi and the South Korean Won. Operating income of $898.3 increased 7%, or $60.0, as higher volumes of $104 and positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $22 were partially offset by higher operating costs of $43 and an unfavorable currency impact of $23. Higher costs were driven by higher distribution and product sourcing costs, including those related to supply chain inefficiencies, inflation, higher incentive compensation, and resources needed to support new project start-ups. Operating margin of 28.6% decreased 10 bp from 28.7% in the prior year as the positive impact of our volume growth was mostly offset by the higher costs.Equity affiliates’ income of $22.1 decreased 38%, or $13.8, driven by an affiliate in Thailand.2021 vs. 2020 (Asia)Sales of $2,920.8 increased 8%, or $204.3, due to favorable currency of 7% and positive pricing of 1%, as both volumes and energy cost pass-through to customers were flat versus 2020. Positive volume contributions from our base merchant business and new plants were offset by a reduced contribution from our Lu'An joint venture. The favorable currency impact was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Chinese Renminbi and South Korean Won against the U.S. Dollar.Operating income of $838.3 decreased 4%, or $32.0, primarily due to unfavorable volume mix of $62 and higher operating costs, including inflation and product sourcing costs, of $32, partially offset by favorable currency of $59.

Significantly higher energy costs across the region increased contractual cost pass-through to our on-site customers. In our merchant business, we successfully implemented pricing actions in all major product lines. While we experienced better demand for merchant products, volumes were relatively flat due to lower hydrogen demand. Additionally, sales in this region were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.Operating income of $503.4 decreased 5%, or $26.0, due to unfavorable currency impacts of $37, higher costs of $31, and unfavorable volume mix of $19, partially offset by higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $61. Higher costs were primarily attributable to inflation and distribution and sourcing costs. Operating margin of 16.3% decreased 630 bp from 22.6% in the prior year primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers, which accounted for approximately 450 bp of the margin decline, and higher costs.Equity affiliates’ income of $78.2 increased 25%, or $15.4, driven by an affiliate in Italy.2021 vs. 2020 (Europe)Sales of $2,345.6 increased 27%, or $498.6, due to higher volumes of 11%, favorable currency impacts of 7%, higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 6%, and positive pricing of 3%. The volume improvement was driven by our base merchant business and new assets, including those from a business in Israel that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020. While our liquid bulk business largely recovered from COVID-19 in fiscal year 2021, demand for packaged gases and hydrogen continued to be lower than pre-pandemic levels. Favorable currency impacts were primarily attributable to the appreciation of the British Pound Sterling and Euro against the U.S. Dollar. Energy cost pass-through to customers was higher primarily in the second half of the year as we had experienced significantly higher natural gas and electricity costs in Europe. The pricing improvement was primarily attributable to our merchant business.Operating income of $529.4 increased 16%, or $74.6, due to higher volumes of $47, favorable currency impacts of $31, and positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $13, partially offset by unfavorable costs of $16.

On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or ""non-GAAP adjustments,"" have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance, or ""non-GAAP adjustments."" For example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. 35Table of ContentsAdjusted Diluted EPSThe table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. Per share impacts are calculated independently and may not sum to total diluted EPS and total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.Fiscal Year Ended 30 SeptemberOperating IncomeEquity Affiliates' IncomeIncome Tax ProvisionNet Income Attributable to Air ProductsDiluted EPS2022 GAAP$2,338.8 $481.5 $500.8 $2,243.5 $10.08 2021 GAAP2,281.4 294.1 462.8 2,028.8 9.12 Change GAAP$0.96 % Change GAAP11 %2022 GAAP$2,338.8 $481.5 $500.8 $2,243.5 $10.08 Business and asset actions73.7 — 12.7 61.0 0.27 Equity method investment impairment charge— 14.8 3.7 11.1 0.05 2022 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$2,412.5 $496.3 $517.2 $2,315.6 $10.41 2021 GAAP$2,281.4 $294.1 $462.8 $2,028.8 $9.12 Facility closure23.2 — 5.8 17.4 0.08 Gain on exchange with joint venture partner(36.8)— (9.5)(27.3)(0.12)Tax election benefit and other— — 12.2 (12.2)(0.05)2021 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$2,267.8 $294.1 $471.3 $2,006.7 $9.02 Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$1.39 % Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")15 %Fiscal Year Ended 30 SeptemberOperatingIncomeEquity Affiliates' IncomeIncome Tax ProvisionNet Income Attributable to Air ProductsDiluted EPS2021 GAAP$2,281.4 $294.1 $462.8 $2,028.8 $9.12 2020 GAAP2,237.6 264.8 478.4 1,901.0 8.55 Change GAAP$0.57 % Change GAAP7 %2021 GAAP$2,281.4 $294.1 $462.8 $2,028.8 $9.12 Facility closure23.2 — 5.8 17.4 0.08 Gain on exchange with joint venture partner(36.8)— (9.5)(27.3)(0.12)Tax election benefit and other— — 12.2 (12.2)(0.05)2021 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$2,267.8 $294.1 $471.3 $2,006.7 $9.02 2020 GAAP$2,237.6 $264.8 $478.4 $1,901.0 $8.55 Company headquarters relocation (income) expense(33.8)— (8.2)(25.6)(0.12)India Finance Act 2020— (33.8)(20.3)(13.5)(0.06)2020 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$2,203.8 $231.0 $449.9 $1,861.9 $8.38 Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$0.64 % Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")8 %36Table of ContentsAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding certain items that we do not believe are indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense.

We do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. Depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the U.S.Cash Flows From OperationsFiscal Year Ended 30 September20222021Net income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products$2,243.5 $2,028.8 Adjustments to reconcile income to cash provided by operating activities:Depreciation and amortization1,338.2 1,321.3 Deferred income taxes32.3 94.0 Facility closure— 23.2 Business and asset actions73.7 — Undistributed earnings of equity method investments(214.7)(138.2)Gain on sale of assets and investments(24.1)(37.2)Share-based compensation48.4 44.5 Noncurrent lease receivables94.0 98.8 Other adjustments(304.9)(116.7)Changes in working capital accounts(115.8)16.7 Cash Provided by Operating Activities$3,170.6 $3,335.2 For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $3,170.6. Undistributed earnings of equity method investments reflects activity from the JIGPC joint venture, which began contributing to our results in late October 2021. We received cash distributions of approximately $155 from this joint venture during the fiscal year. Other adjustments of $304.9 included adjustments for noncash currency impacts of intercompany balances, deferred costs associated with new projects, contributions to pension plans, and payments made for leasing activities. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $115.8, primarily driven by a use of cash of $475.2 from trade receivables, less allowances, $94.3 from inventory and $77.0 from other working capital, partially offset by a source of cash of $532.5 from payables and accrued liabilities. The use of cash within trade receivables includes the impacts of higher natural gas costs contractually passed through to customers and higher underlying sales. The source of cash within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs and customer advances for sale of equipment projects. The use of cash within other working capital primarily relates to contract fulfillment costs and the timing of income tax payments.For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $3,335.2. Other adjustments of $116.7 included pension plan contributions of $44.6 and pension income of $38.9 that did not have a cash impact. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $16.7, primarily driven by a $187.9 source of cash from payables and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $130.5 use of cash from trade receivables, less allowances. The source of cash within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs, which also drove the use of cash within trade receivables as we contractually passed through these higher costs to customers.41Table of ContentsCash Flows From Investing ActivitiesFiscal Year Ended 30 September20222021Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits($2,926.5)($2,464.2)Acquisitions, less cash acquired(65.1)(10.5)Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates(1,658.4)(76.0)Proceeds from sale of assets and investments46.2 37.5 Purchases of investments(1,637.8)(2,100.7)Proceeds from investments2,377.4 1,875.2 Other investing activities7.0 5.8 Cash Used for Investing Activities($3,857.2)($2,732.9)For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2022, cash used for investing activities was $3,857.2. Capital expenditures primarily included $2,926.5 for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits and $1,658.4 for investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section below for further detail. Proceeds from investments of $2,377.4 resulted from maturities of time deposits and treasury securities with terms greater than three months but less than one year and exceeded purchases of investments of $1,637.8.For the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, cash used for investing activities was $2,732.9. Capital expenditures for plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,464.2. Purchases of investments with terms greater than three months but less than one year of $2,100.7 exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,875.2, which resulted from maturities of time deposits and treasury securities.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below. We also present a reconciliation of our capital expenditures to cash used for investing activities on page 40.Fiscal Year Ended 30 September20222021Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits$2,926.5 $2,464.2 Acquisitions, less cash acquired65.1 10.5 Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates(A)1,658.4 76.0 Capital Expenditures$4,650.0 $2,550.7 (A)Includes contributions from noncontrolling partners in consolidated subsidiaries as discussed below.Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 totaled $4,650.0 compared to $2,550.7 in fiscal year 2021. The increase of $2,099.3 was primarily driven by our initial investment of $1.6 billion in the new JIGPC joint venture, which included approximately $130 from a non-controlling partner in one of our subsidiaries. We expect to make an additional investment of approximately $1 billion, which will also include a contribution from our non-controlling partner, for the second phase of the project, which we expect to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Refer to Note 7, Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Outlook for Investing ActivitiesWe expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 to be approximately $5 to $5.5 billion. It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.42Table of ContentsWe anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance, cash generated from continuing operations, and financing activities as needed. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate (1) investments in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth; (2) purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and (3) acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies.Cash Flows From Financing ActivitiesFiscal Year Ended 30 September20222021Long-term debt proceeds$766.2 $178.9 Payments on long-term debt(400.0)(462.9)Net increase in commercial paper and short-term borrowings17.9 1.0 Dividends paid to shareholders(1,383.3)(1,256.7)Proceeds from stock option exercises 19.3 10.6 Investments by noncontrolling interests21.0 136.6 Other financing activities(41.7)(28.4)Cash Used for Financing Activities($1,000.6)($1,420.9)In fiscal year 2022, cash used for financing activities was $1,000.6. The use of cash was primarily driven by dividend payments to shareholders of $1,383.3 and payments on long-term debt of $400.0 for the repayment of a 3.0% Senior Note at maturity. These uses of cash were partially offset by long-term debt proceeds of $766.2.In fiscal year 2021, cash used for financing activities was $1,420.9 and primarily included dividend payments to shareholders of $1,256.7 and payments on long-term debt of $462.9, partially offset by long-term debt proceeds of $178.9 and investments by noncontrolling interests of $136.6. The payments on long-term debt included the repayment of a 0.375% €350.0 million Eurobond ($428) in June 2021.Financing and Capital StructureCapital needs in fiscal year 2022 were satisfied with our cash balance and cash from operations. Total debt increased from $7,637.2 as of 30 September 2021 to $7,644.8 as of 30 September 2022. Total debt includes related party debt of $781.0 and $358.4 as of 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2021, respectively. Various debt agreements to which we are a party include financial covenants and other restrictions, including restrictions pertaining to the ability to create property liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. As of 30 September 2022, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.Credit FacilitiesOn 31 March 2021, we entered into a five-year $2,500 revolving credit agreement maturing 31 March 2026 with a syndicate of banks (the “2021 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On 31 March 2022, we amended the 2021 Credit Agreement to exercise our option to increase the maximum borrowing capacity to $2,750 and transition the benchmark rate from the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""). All other terms remain unchanged from the original agreement.The only financial covenant in the 2021 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (equal to total debt plus total equity) not to exceed 70%. Total debt as of 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2021, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization, was 35.8% and 35.2%, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2022.We also have credit facilities available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries totaling $749.0, of which $457.5 was borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2022. The amount borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2021 was $176.2.43Table of ContentsEquity SecuritiesOn 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares in fiscal years 2022 or 2021. As of 30 September 2022, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remained.DividendsThe Board of Directors determines whether to declare cash dividends on our common stock and the timing and amount based on financial condition and other factors it deems relevant. Dividends are paid quarterly, usually during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. In fiscal year 2022, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.62 per share, representing an 8% increase, or $0.12 per share, from the previous dividend of $1.50 per share. This is the 40th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future at comparable or increased levels.On 22 November 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share that is payable on 13 February 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 3 January 2023.Discontinued OperationsIn fiscal year 2022, cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of $59.6 resulted from cash received as part of a state tax refund related to the sale of our former Performance Materials Division in fiscal year 2017.In fiscal year 2021, cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of $6.7 resulted from cash received as part of a state tax settlement related to the sale of our former Performance Materials Division in fiscal year 2017.PENSION BENEFITSWe and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits.Net Periodic BenefitThe table below summarizes the components of net periodic benefit for our U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans for the fiscal years ended 30 September:20222021Service cost$39.8 $44.7 Non-service related benefits(44.7)(83.0)Other1.3 1.0 Net periodic benefit($3.6)($37.3)Net periodic benefit of $3.6 decreased from $37.3 in the prior year, primarily due to lower non-service related benefits. We increased the percentage of fixed income investments within the plan asset portfolios, which resulted in lower expected returns on plan assets for both the U.S. salaried and the U.K. pension plans. Additionally, a higher discount rate resulted in higher interest costs. These two reductions in non-service related benefits were only partially offset by lower actuarial loss amortization. Our non-service related benefits are reflected within ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on our consolidated income statements.Service costs result from benefits earned by active employees and are reflected as operating expenses primarily within ""Cost of sales"" and ""Selling and administrative"" on our consolidated income statements. The amount of service costs capitalized in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was not material.44Table of ContentsThe table below summarizes the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit for the fiscal years ended 30 September:20222021Weighted average discount rate – Service cost2.4 %2.3 %Weighted average discount rate – Interest cost 2.0 %1.8 %Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets5.1 %6.0 %Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase3.4 %3.4 %2023 OutlookIn fiscal year 2023, we expect to recognize pension expense of approximately $110 to $120 primarily driven by non-service related costs, including higher interest cost and lower estimated expected returns on plan assets due to a smaller beginning balance of plan assets.In fiscal year 2022, we recognized net actuarial losses of $143.5 in other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets could impact the actuarial gain or loss and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2023.Effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, management will review and disclose our adjusted results excluding the impact of non-service related costs as they are not indicative of the plans’ future contribution needs due to the funded status of the plans. Non-service related costs are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as recent changes to the allocation of our pension plan assets associated with de-risking as well as volatility in equity and debt markets.Pension FundingFunded StatusThe projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future salary increases. The plan funded status is calculated as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at the end of the period.The table below summarizes the project benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status for our U.S. and international plans as of 30 September:20222021Projected benefit obligation$3,588.3 $5,304.9 Fair value of plan assets at end of year3,526.0 5,248.7 Plan funded status($62.3)($56.2)The net unfunded liability of $62.3 as of 30 September 2022 increased $6.1 from $56.2 as of 30 September 2021, primarily due to unfavorable asset experience, partially offset by a lower liability due to increased discount rates. Company ContributionsPension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2022 and 2021, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $44.7 and $44.6, respectively.Funding OutlookFor fiscal year 2023, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $25 to $35. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors.45Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESRefer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies, and Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.The accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current and/or future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. If conditions change, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors.Depreciable Lives of Plant and EquipmentPlant and equipment, net at 30 September 2022 totaled $14,160.5, and depreciation expense totaled $1,302.7 during fiscal year 2022. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business circumstances change. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.Our regional segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.Our regional segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. In addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. Impairment of AssetsThere were no triggering events in fiscal year 2022 that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups, reporting units that contain goodwill, or indefinite-lived intangibles assets. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment.In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we recorded a noncash charge of $14.8 for the other-than-temporary impairment of two small equity method investments in our Asia segment. Refer to the “Impairment of Assets” subsections below for additional detail. 46Table of ContentsImpairment of Assets – Plant and EquipmentPlant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include:•a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping;•a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition;•an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset;•a reduction in revenues that is other than temporary;•a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping; or•changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.In fiscal year 2022, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of our asset groupings may not be recoverable.Impairment of Assets – GoodwillThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $823.0 as of 30 September 2022. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 9, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five reportable business segments, seven operating segments and 11 reporting units, eight of which include a goodwill balance. Refer to Note 23, Business Segment and Geographic Information, for additional information. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments.As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. However, we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 47Table of ContentsTo determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test, noting no indications of impairment. The fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, changes in the strategy of the reporting unit, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.Impairment of Assets – Intangible AssetsIntangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 September 2022 totaled $314.4 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under ""Impairment of Assets – Plant and Equipment"" for a description of how impairment losses are determined.Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2022 totaled $33.1 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.Disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 10, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements.In the fourth quarter of 2022, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles which resulted in no impairment.Impairment of Assets – Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $3,353.8 at 30 September 2022. The majority of our investments are ventures with other industrial gas companies. Summarized financial information of our equity affiliates is included in Note 7, Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. 48Table of ContentsAn impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs. We estimate the fair value of our investments under the income approach, which considers the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee, and/or the market approach, which considers market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gas companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment of our investments in two small equity affiliates in the Asia segment. As a result, we recorded a noncash charge of $14.8 ($11.1 after-tax, or $0.05 per share) to write down the full carrying value of the investments. This charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements within “Equity affiliates' income” and was not recorded in segment results. There were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of our other investments may not be recoverable.Revenue Recognition – Cost Incurred Input MethodRevenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule delays, technical issues, cost inflation, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.In addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities, our sale of equipment projects within our Corporate and other segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $30 in fiscal year 2022 and $19 in fiscal year 2021. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years. We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.Revenue Recognition – On-site Customer ContractsFor customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities. Certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As of 30 September 2022, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded as noncurrent, was $269.8, and net deferred tax liabilities were $1,111.7. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2022 were $103.5, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2022 was $500.8. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.49Table of ContentsManagement judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in income tax expense.A 1% increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of approximately $28.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions, expense, and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans.Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. We measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. With respect to impacts on pension benefit obligations, a 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase, respectively, to pension expense of approximately $20 per year.The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase, respectively, to pension expense of approximately $23 per year.50Table of ContentsWe use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $7 per year.Loss ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the liability increases. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties; interest rate swaps; cross currency interest rate swaps; and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the ""net financial instrument position"" and is disclosed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. Our net financial instrument position decreased from a liability of $7,850.3 at 30 September 2021 to a liability of $6,898.6 at 30 September 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the effect of higher interest rates on the fair value of U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate debt and the effect of a stronger U.S Dollar on foreign currency-denominated debt. 51Table of ContentsThe analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date, such as interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatility.Interest Rate RiskOur debt portfolio as of 30 September 2022, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 79% fixed-rate debt and 21% variable-rate debt. Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2021, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 89% fixed-rate debt and 11% variable-rate debt. The increase in variable-rate debt is primarily the result of a $600 million increase in the outstanding notional of fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps. The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2022, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $364 and $587 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2022 and 2021, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $425 and $692 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2022 and 2021, respectively.Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $16 and $8 of interest incurred per year at 30 September 2022 and 2021, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $16 and $8 per year at 30 September 2022 and 2021, respectively.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2022 and 2021, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $165 and $343 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2022 and 2021, respectively. The lower decrease or increase from a 10% strengthening or weakening, respectively, was primarily due to the origination of project cost hedges that generate losses and increase the net liability position when the functional currency strengthens or generate gains and decrease the net liability position when the functional currency weakens.The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.The majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the United States. Therefore, financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $45 and $25, respectively.52Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:15.267370

Approximately 23,000 passionate, talented, and committed employees from diverse backgrounds together are driven by Air Products’ higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability, and reimagine what is possible to address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world. Our products and services enable our customers to improve their environmental performance, product quality, and productivity. Our core business provides essential gases, related equipment, and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, medical, and food. We also develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world’s largest clean hydrogen projects that will support the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy in the heavy-duty transportation and industrial sectors. Additionally, we are the world leader in the supply of LNG process technology and equipment and provide turbomachinery, membrane systems, and cryogenic containers globally. For additional information on our product and service offerings, including production, distribution, and end use, refer to Item 1, Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Air Products conducts business in approximately 50 countries and regions throughout the world. Our industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East and India segments and generates the majority of our sales via our on-site and merchant supply modes. Approximately half our total revenue is generated through the on-site supply mode, which is governed by contracts that are generally long-term in nature with provisions that allow us to pass through changes in energy costs to our customers. Our Corporate and other segment includes the results of our sale of equipment businesses, costs for corporate support functions and global management activities, and other income and expenses not directly associated with the regional segments, such as foreign exchange gains and losses. For additional information regarding our supply modes and business segments, refer to Note 6, Revenue Recognition, and Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements.2023 IN SUMMARYIn fiscal year 2023, we achieved earnings growth through pricing discipline in our merchant business as well as improved on-site volumes, including higher demand for hydrogen, despite inflation, higher maintenance activities, and higher costs to support our long-term strategy. Due to the structure of our contracts, which generally contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements, our on-site business generates stable cash flow and consistently contributes about half our total sales, regardless of the economic environment. We also recognized higher income from our equity affiliates due to the contribution of the second phase of the Jazan gasification and power project and positive results from other unconsolidated joint ventures across the regions.Additionally, we successfully secured capital to fund low- and zero-carbon hydrogen growth projects. In March, we issued our inaugural green bonds in concurrent $600 and €700 million debt offerings, making Air Products the first U.S. chemical company to qualify green and blue hydrogen projects as an eligible expenditure category. Additionally, in May, our NEOM Green Hydrogen Company joint venture completed financial close on the world’s largest green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility, securing $6.1 billion of non-recourse financing from local, regional, and international banks and financial institutions. This funding is an important strategic milestone that will allow us to continue executing projects that will accelerate the energy transition while creating long-term value for our shareholders.In addition to investing in high return projects, we believe creating shareholder value includes paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, which we have increased for 41 consecutive years. In fiscal year 2023, we increased our dividend to $1.75 per share, representing an 8% increase, or $0.13 per share, from the previous dividend of $1.62 per share.23Table of ContentsFiscal Year 2023 Highlights•Sales of $12.6 billion decreased 1%, or $98.6, as lower energy cost pass-through to customers of 6% and unfavorable currency of 3% were mostly offset by higher pricing of 5% and higher volumes of 3%.•Operating income of $2.5 billion increased 7%, or $155.8, as our pricing actions and higher volumes were partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable currency. Additionally, we recorded higher charges for business and asset actions in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. Operating margin of 19.8% increased 140 basis points (""bp"") from 18.4% in the prior year, which included a positive impact from lower energy cost pass-through to customers in 2023.•Equity affiliates' income of $604.3 increased 26%, or $122.8, primarily due to a higher contribution from the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company (""JIGPC"") joint venture, which completed the second phase of the asset purchase associated with the Jazan gasification and power project in January 2023, as well as higher income from our affiliates in Italy and Mexico. The prior year included recognition of the remaining deferred profit associated with air separation units previously sold to Jazan Gas Project Company, which was partially offset by an impairment charge related to two small affiliates in our Asia segment. •Net income of $2.3 billion increased 3%, or $72.1, primarily due to favorable pricing, net of power and fuel costs, partially offset by a charge for business and asset actions, higher non-service pension costs, and higher other costs. Net income margin of 18.6% increased 80 bp from 17.8% in the prior year, which included a positive impact from lower energy cost pass-through.•Adjusted EBITDA of $4.7 billion increased 11%, or $454.8, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.3% increased 390 bp from 33.4% in the prior year.•Diluted EPS of $10.30 increased 2%, or $0.22 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS of $11.51 increased 12%, or $1.26 per share. A summary table of changes in diluted EPS is presented below.24Table of ContentsChanges in Diluted EPS Attributable to Air ProductsThe per share impacts presented in the table below were calculated independently and may not sum to the total change in diluted EPS due to rounding.Fiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022Increase (Decrease)Total Diluted EPS$10.33 $10.14 $0.19 Less: Diluted EPS from income from discontinued operations0.03 0.06 (0.03)Diluted EPS From Continuing Operations$10.30 $10.08 $0.22 % Change from prior year2 %Operating ImpactsUnderlying businessVolume$0.22 Price, net of variable costs2.39 Other costs(1.11)Currency(0.29)Business and asset actions(0.65)Total Operating Impacts$0.56 Other ImpactsEquity affiliates' income$0.40 Equity method investment impairment charge0.05 Interest expense(0.18)Other non-operating income/expense, net, excluding discrete item below0.11 Non-service pension cost/benefit, net(0.44)Change in effective tax rate(0.12)Noncontrolling interests(0.15)Weighted average diluted shares(0.01)Total Other Impacts($0.34)Total Change in Diluted EPS From Continuing Operations$0.22 % Change from prior year2 %The table below summarizes the diluted per share impact of our non-GAAP adjustments in fiscal years 2023 and 2022:Fiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022Increase (Decrease)Diluted EPS From Continuing Operations$10.30 $10.08 $0.22 Business and asset actions0.92 0.27 0.65 Equity method investment impairment charge— 0.05 (0.05)Non-service pension cost (benefit), net0.29 (0.15)0.44 Adjusted Diluted EPS From Continuing Operations$11.51 $10.25 $1.26 % Change from prior year12 %25Table of ContentsOUTLOOKThe guidance below should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The first pillar of our two-pillar growth strategy is our core industrial gas business, which is supported by a consistent stream of revenue due to the structure of our on-site contracts. We expect new on-site projects, including the natural gas-to-syngas processing facility in Uzbekistan, as well as several new LNG sale of equipment projects to contribute to our results in 2024. To mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures, we are focused on actions we can control, such as maintaining pricing discipline in our merchant business. Additionally, we expect to see cost improvement in certain areas of our organization as a result of strategic business actions taken earlier in 2023.The second pillar of our strategy is our blue and green hydrogen projects, many of which are already under execution. We anticipate benefits from tax incentives created by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for carbon sequestration and clean hydrogen production in future years once our projects in these areas come on-stream, such as our blue hydrogen and blue ammonia clean energy complex in Louisiana. We are also gaining support from foreign regulators for our projects outside the U.S., including the recently announced blue hydrogen project in the Netherlands. We believe the infrastructure readiness we are preparing now will continue to be a competitive advantage for Air Products, allowing us to create sustainable growth opportunities that deliver value to our shareholders, customers, employees, and communities around the world.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTSChange vs. Prior YearFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022$%/bpGAAP MeasuresSales$12,600.0$12,698.6($98.6)(1 %)Operating income2,494.62,338.8155.8 7 %Operating margin19.8 %18.4 %140 bpEquity affiliates’ income$604.3$481.5$122.8 26 %Net income2,338.62,266.572.1 3 %Net income margin18.6 %17.8 %80 bpNon-GAAP MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA$4,701.8$4,247.0$454.8 11 %Adjusted EBITDA margin37.3 %33.4 %390 bpSalesThe table below summarizes the major factors that impacted consolidated sales for the periods presented:Volume3 %Price5 %Energy cost pass-through to customers(6 %)Currency(3 %)Total Consolidated Sales Change(1 %)Sales of $12.6 billion decreased 1%, or $98.6, as lower energy cost pass-through to customers of 6% and unfavorable currency of 3% were mostly offset by higher pricing of 5% and higher volumes of 3%. Lower natural gas prices in the Americas and Europe segments drove the lower energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers. Unfavorable currency was primarily attributable to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Chinese Renminbi. Pricing actions in our merchant business improved sales across each of our regional segments, while the volume improvement was primarily attributable to our on-site business in the Americas and Asia segments.26Table of ContentsCost of Sales and Gross MarginCost of sales of $8.8 billion decreased 5%, or $505.5, due to lower energy cost pass-through to customers of $791 and a favorable impact from currency of $213, partially offset by higher costs associated with sales volumes of $311 and unfavorable other costs of $188. The unfavorable costs were driven by inflation, project development activities, and planned maintenance. Gross margin of 29.9% increased 340 bp from 26.5% in the prior year primarily due to favorable pricing and lower energy cost pass-through to customers, partially offset by the impact of higher costs. The favorable impact from lower energy cost pass-through to customers was about 200 bp. Selling and Administrative ExpenseSelling and administrative expense of $957.0 increased 6%, or $56.4, primarily due to higher employee compensation, inflation, and additional costs to support growth, partially offset by a favorable impact from currency. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased to 7.6% from 7.1% in the prior year.Research and Development ExpenseResearch and development expense of $105.6 increased 3%, or $2.7. Research and development expense as a percentage of sales of 0.8% was flat versus the prior year.Business and Asset ActionsIn fiscal year 2023, we recorded a charge of $244.6 ($204.9 attributable to Air Products after tax, or $0.92 per share) for strategic actions intended to optimize costs and focus resources on our growth projects. Of the expense, $217.6 resulted from noncash charges to write off assets associated with exited projects that were previously under construction. The remaining expense included $27.0 for severance and other benefits associated with position eliminations and restructuring of certain organizations globally. Refer to Note 4, Business and Asset Actions, for additional information.In fiscal year 2022, we divested our small industrial gas business in Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a result, we recorded a noncash charge of $73.7 ($61.0 after tax, or $0.27 per share), which included transaction costs and cumulative currency translation losses.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income of $34.8 decreased 38%, or $21.1, primarily due to lower income from the sale of assets and fees charged to our equity affiliates for use of patents and technology as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.Operating Income and MarginOperating income of $2.5 billion increased 7%, or $155.8. Positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $649 and higher volumes of $58 were partially offset by higher costs of $302 and an unfavorable currency impact of $78. The higher costs were driven by inflation, planned maintenance, and incentive compensation, as well as project development and other costs related to the execution of our growth strategy. Additionally, as discussed above, we recorded higher charges for business and asset actions in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022. Operating margin of 19.8% increased 140 bp from 18.4% in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of pricing as well as lower energy cost pass-through to customers, which positively impacted margin by about 100 basis points, partially offset by higher charges for business and asset actions and higher other costs.Equity Affiliates’ IncomeEquity affiliates' income of $604.3 increased 26%, or $122.8, primarily due to a higher contribution from the JIGPC joint venture, which completed the second phase of the asset purchase associated with the Jazan gasification and power project in January 2023, as well as higher income from our affiliates in Italy and Mexico. Additionally, the prior year included an impairment charge of $14.8 ($11.1 after tax, or $0.05 per share) related to two small affiliates in the Asia segment. These impacts were partially offset by the prior year recognition of the remaining deferred profit associated with air separation units previously sold to Jazan Gas Project Company, net of other project finalization costs.For additional information on our equity affiliates, refer to Note 9, Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements.27Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022Interest incurred$292.9 $169.0 Less: Capitalized interest115.4 41.0 Interest expense$177.5 $128.0 Interest incurred increased 73%, or $123.9, driven by a higher average interest rate on variable-rate instruments in our debt portfolio as well as a higher debt balance, which is largely attributable to the U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes issued in March 2023 under our new Green Finance Framework as well as borrowings on our foreign credit facilities. Capitalized interest increased $74.4 due to a higher carrying value of projects under construction.Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), NetOther non-operating expense was $39.0 versus income of $62.4 in the prior year primarily due to higher non-service pension costs in 2023, which were driven by higher interest cost and lower expected returns on plan assets for the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. This impact was partially offset by higher interest income on cash and cash items due to higher interest rates.Discontinued OperationsIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $7.4 ($0.03 per share) and $12.6 ($0.06 per share) in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. This primarily resulted from the release of unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions taken with respect to the sale of our former Performance Materials Division for which the statute of limitations expired. Net Income and Net Income MarginNet income of $2.3 billion increased 3%, or $72.1, primarily due to favorable pricing, net of power and fuel costs, partially offset by the charge for business and asset actions, higher non-service pension costs, and higher other costs. Net income margin of 18.6% increased 80 bp from 17.8% in the prior year due to the factors noted above as well as lower energy cost pass-through to customers, which positively impacted margin by about 100 bp.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginAdjusted EBITDA of $4.7 billion increased 11%, or $454.8, primarily due to higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, partially offset by higher costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.3% increased 390 bp from 33.4% in the prior year due to the factors noted above as well as lower energy cost pass-through to customers, which positively impacted margin by about 200 bp.Effective Tax RateThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate.Our effective tax rate was 19.1% and 18.2% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. During fiscal year 2023, we recorded a charge for business and asset actions of $244.6 ($204.9 attributable to Air Products after tax). Refer to Note 4, Business and Asset Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The charge included certain losses for which we could not recognize an income tax benefit and were subject to a valuation allowance of $36.0. Partially offsetting the valuation allowance cost was a $15.9 income tax benefit from a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary.Our effective tax rate for the current year was higher due to lower excess tax benefits on share-based compensation and the discrete tax impact of our business and asset actions discussed above. In addition, certain recurring income tax benefits had less of an impact on our effective tax rate in the current year as they did not increase in proportion to the increase in income. Our current rate is also higher due to nonrecurring benefits in several foreign jurisdictions due to the impact of tax rate changes and productivity credit claims in the prior year.Our adjusted effective tax rate, which does not include the impact of our business and asset actions discussed above, was 18.9% and 18.1% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. 28Table of ContentsDISCUSSION OF RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENTAmericasChange vs. Prior YearFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022$%/bpSales$5,369.3$5,368.9$0.4 —%Operating income1,439.71,174.4265.3 23%Operating margin26.8 %21.9 %490 bpEquity affiliates’ income$109.2$98.2$11.011%Adjusted EBITDA2,198.21,902.1296.1 16%Adjusted EBITDA margin40.9 %35.4 %550 bpThe table below summarizes the major factors that impacted sales in the Americas segment for the periods presented:Volume6 %Price6 %Energy cost pass-through to customers(11 %)Currency(1 %)Total Americas Sales Change— %Sales of $5.4 billion were flat as higher volumes of 6% and higher pricing of 6% were offset by lower energy cost pass-through to customers of 11% and an unfavorable currency impact of 1%. The volume improvement was primarily attributable to our on-site business, including better demand for hydrogen. Additionally, we recovered higher costs in our merchant business through continued focus on pricing actions. Energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers was lower due to lower natural gas prices.Operating income of $1.4 billion increased 23%, or $265.3, due to positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $306 and favorable volumes of $78, partially offset by higher costs of $112 and an unfavorable currency impact of $7. Higher costs were driven by inflation, planned maintenance, and higher incentive compensation. Operating margin of 26.8% increased 490 bp from 21.9% in the prior year primarily due to favorable pricing and lower energy cost pass-through to customers, partially offset by higher costs. The favorable impact from lower energy cost pass-through to customers was about 250 bp.Equity affiliates’ income of $109.2 increased 11%, or $11.0, driven by an affiliate in Mexico.29Table of ContentsAsiaChange vs. Prior YearFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022$%/bpSales$3,216.1$3,143.3$72.8 2%Operating income906.5898.38.2 1%Operating margin28.2 %28.6 %(40 bp)Equity affiliates’ income$29.7$22.1$7.634%Adjusted EBITDA1,369.71,356.912.8 1%Adjusted EBITDA margin42.6 %43.2 %(60 bp)The table below summarizes the major factors that impacted sales in the Asia segment for the periods presented:Volume3 %Price3 %Energy cost pass-through to customers2 %Currency(6 %)Total Asia Sales Change2 %Sales of $3.2 billion increased 2%, or $72.8, due to higher volumes of 3%, positive pricing of 3%, and higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 2%, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 6%. Positive volume contributions from several new traditional industrial gas plants in our on-site business were partially offset by weak economic growth in China and lower activity in the electronics manufacturing industry. Higher power costs across the region were recovered by our merchant pricing actions. In our on-site business, the higher power costs increased energy cost pass-through to our customers. The unfavorable currency impact was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Chinese Renminbi.Operating income of $906.5 increased 1%, or $8.2, due to positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $59 and higher volumes of $31, partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of $56 and higher costs of $26. The higher costs were driven by project development, higher planned maintenance, and inflation. Operating margin of 28.2% decreased 40 bp from 28.6% in the prior year as higher costs were partially offset by our pricing actions.Equity affiliates’ income of $29.7 increased 34%, or $7.6, driven by an affiliate in Thailand.30Table of ContentsEuropeChange vs. Prior YearFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022$%/bpSales$2,963.1$3,086.1($123.0)(4%)Operating income663.4503.4160.0 32%Operating margin22.4 %16.3 %610 bpEquity affiliates’ income$102.5$78.2$24.331%Adjusted EBITDA962.1776.8185.3 24%Adjusted EBITDA margin32.5 %25.2 %730 bpThe table below summarizes the major factors that impacted sales in the Europe segment for the periods presented:Volume— %Price7 %Energy cost pass-through to customers(9 %)Currency(2 %)Total Europe Sales Change(4 %)Sales of $3.0 billion decreased 4%, or $123.0, due to lower energy cost pass-through to customers of 9% and an unfavorable currency impact of 2%, partially offset by higher pricing of 7%. Energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers was lower, reflecting lower natural gas prices across the region. Currency negatively impacted sales due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. The pricing improvement was attributable to our merchant business. Volumes were flat as improvement in hydrogen in our on-site business was offset by lower demand for merchant products. Operating income of $663.4 increased 32%, or $160.0, as higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $275 was partially offset by higher costs of $100 driven by inflation, higher incentive compensation, and planned maintenance, unfavorable business mix of $8, and an unfavorable currency impact of $7. Operating margin of 22.4% increased 610 bp from 16.3% in the prior year due to the factors noted above as well as lower energy cost pass-through to customers, which positively impacted margin by about 100 bp.Equity affiliates’ income of $102.5 increased 31%, or $24.3, driven by an affiliate in Italy.31Table of ContentsMiddle East and IndiaChange vs. Prior YearFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022$%Sales$162.5 $129.5 $33.0 25 %Operating income16.9 21.1 (4.2)(20 %)Equity affiliates’ income349.8 293.9 55.9 19 %Adjusted EBITDA394.2 341.9 52.3 15 %Sales of $162.5 increased 25%, or $33.0, driven by higher merchant volumes.

In January 2023, we made an additional investment in the JIGPC joint venture, which completed the second phase of the asset purchase associated with the Jazan gasification and power project. The resulting higher contribution from JIGPC was partially offset by a prior year net benefit recognized for the remaining deferred profit associated with air separation units previously sold to Jazan Gas Project Company, net of other project finalization costs.Corporate and otherChange vs. Prior YearFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022$%Sales$889.0 $970.8($81.8)(8 %)Operating loss(287.3)(184.7)(102.6)(56 %)Adjusted EBITDA(222.4)(130.7)(91.7)(70 %)Sales of $889.0 decreased 8%, or $81.8, and operating loss of $287.3 increased $102.6, primarily due to lower contributions from our sale of equipment businesses.

On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, the adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or ""non-GAAP adjustments,"" have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we exclude the impact of the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans as further discussed below. Additionally, we may exclude certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENT FOR NON-SERVICE PENSION COST (BENEFIT), NETOur adjusted EPS and the adjusted effective tax rate exclude the impact of non-service related components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans. The prior year non-GAAP financial measures presented above and reconciled below have been recast accordingly to conform to the fiscal year 2023 presentation. Non-service related components are recurring, non-operating items that include interest cost, expected returns on plan assets, prior service cost amortization, actuarial loss amortization, as well as special termination benefits, curtailments, and settlements. The net impact of non-service related components is reflected within “Other non-operating income (expense), net” on our consolidated income statements. Adjusting for the impact of non-service pension components provides management and users of our financial statements with a more accurate representation of our underlying business performance because these components are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as recent changes to the allocation of our pension plan assets associated with de-risking as well as volatility in equity and debt markets. Further, non-service related components are not indicative of our defined benefit plans’ future contribution needs due to the funded status of the plans. 33Table of ContentsADJUSTED DILUTED EPSThe table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. Per share impacts are calculated independently and may not sum to total diluted EPS and total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.2023 vs. 2022Operating IncomeEquity Affiliates' IncomeOther Non-Operating Income/Expense, NetIncome Tax ProvisionNet Income Attributable to Air ProductsDiluted EPS2023 GAAP$2,494.6 $604.3 ($39.0)$551.2 $2,292.8 $10.30 2022 GAAP2,338.8 481.5 62.4 500.8 2,243.5 10.08 $ Change GAAP$0.22 % Change GAAP2 %2023 GAAP$2,494.6 $604.3 ($39.0)$551.2 $2,292.8 $10.30 Business and asset actions(A)244.6 — — 34.7 204.9 0.92 Non-service pension cost, net— — 86.8 21.6 65.2 0.29 2023 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$2,739.2 $604.3 $47.8 $607.5 $2,562.9 $11.51 2022 GAAP$2,338.8 $481.5 $62.4 $500.8 $2,243.5 $10.08 Business and asset actions73.7 — — 12.7 61.0 0.27 Equity method investment impairment charge— 14.8 — 3.7 11.1 0.05 Non-service pension benefit, net— — (44.7)(10.8)(33.9)(0.15)2022 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$2,412.5 $496.3 $17.7 $506.4 $2,281.7 $10.25 $ Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$1.26 % Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")12 %(A ) Charge includes $5.0 attributable to noncontrolling interests.34Table of ContentsADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGINWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance. Margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding.

Additionally, we adjust additions to plant and equipment to exclude NEOM Green Hydrogen Company (“NGHC”) expenditures funded by the joint venture's non-recourse project financing as well as our partners’ equity contributions to arrive at a measure that we believe is more representative of our investment activities. Substantially all the funding we provide to NGHC is limited for use by the venture for capital expenditures.

As further discussed in the ""Cash Flows From Financing Activities"" section below, we have the ability to raise capital through a variety of financing activities, including accessing capital or commercial paper markets or drawing upon our credit facilities.As of 30 September 2023, we had $1,497.1 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of $1,617.0. We do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. Depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the U.S.Cash Flows From OperationsFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022Net income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products$2,292.8 $2,243.5 Adjustments to reconcile income to cash provided by operating activities:Depreciation and amortization1,358.3 1,338.2 Deferred income taxes(24.7)32.3 Business and asset actions244.6 73.7 Undistributed earnings of equity method investments(261.2)(214.7)Gain on sale of assets and investments(15.8)(24.1)Share-based compensation59.9 48.4 Noncurrent lease receivables79.6 94.0 Other adjustments(103.0)(304.9)Working capital changes that provided (used) cash, excluding effects of acquisitions:Trade receivables130.7 (475.2)Inventories(129.4)(94.3)Other receivables(93.8)(1.8)Payables and accrued liabilities(213.3)532.5 Other working capital(119.0)(77.0)Cash Provided by Operating Activities$3,205.7 $3,170.6 In fiscal year 2023, cash provided by operating activities was $3,205.7. Business and asset actions of $244.6 included noncash charges to write off assets related to our exit from certain projects previously under construction as well as an expense for severance and other benefits. Refer to Note 4, Business and Asset Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The impacts associated with our operating leases are reflected within ""Other adjustments,"" which included a lump-sum payment of $209 for a land lease associated with the NGHC joint venture. Working capital accounts resulted in a net use of cash of $424.8. The use of cash of $213.3 within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from lower prices for the purchase of natural gas, a decrease in value of derivatives that hedge intercompany loans, and payments for incentive compensation under the fiscal year 2022 plan. Inventories resulted in a use of cash of $129.4 primarily due to additional packaged gases inventory, including helium. The use of cash of $119.0 within other working capital was primarily driven by the timing of income tax payments. The source of cash of $130.7 from trade receivables was primarily attributable to collection of higher natural gas costs contractually passed through to on-site customers in fiscal year 2023.39Table of ContentsIn fiscal year 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $3,170.6. Undistributed earnings of equity method investments of $214.7 reflects activity from the JIGPC joint venture, which began contributing to our results in late October 2021. We received cash distributions of approximately $155 from this joint venture during fiscal year 2022. Other adjustments of $304.9 included adjustments for noncash currency impacts of intercompany balances, deferred costs associated with new projects, contributions to pension plans, and payments made for leasing activities. Working capital accounts resulted in a net use of cash of $115.8. The use of cash of $475.2 within trade receivables included the impacts of higher underlying sales and higher natural gas costs passed through to our on-site customers. The source of cash of $532.5 within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs and customer advances for sale of equipment projects. Other working capital accounts resulted in a use of cash of $77.0 primarily due to contract fulfillment costs and the timing of income tax payments.Cash Flows From Investing ActivitiesFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits($4,626.4)($2,926.5)Acquisitions, less cash acquired— (65.1)Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates(912.0)(1,658.4)Investment in financing receivables(665.1)— Proceeds from sale of assets and investments25.4 46.2 Purchases of investments(640.1)(1,637.8)Proceeds from investments897.0 2,377.4 Other investing activities4.8 7.0 Cash Used for Investing Activities($5,916.4)($3,857.2)In fiscal year 2023, cash used for investing activities was $5,916.4. The use of cash primarily resulted from capital expenditures of $4,626.4 for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates of $912.0, and investments in financing receivables of $665.1. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section below for further detail. Maturities of time deposits and short-term treasury securities provided cash of $897.0, which exceeded purchases of investments of $640.1.In fiscal year 2022, cash used for investing activities was $3,857.2. Capital expenditures primarily included $2,926.5 for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, and $1,658.4 for investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. Proceeds from investments of $2,377.4 resulted from maturities of time deposits and short-term treasury securities and exceeded purchases of investments of $1,637.8.Capital ExpendituresThe components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below.

The increase of $574.4 was driven by spending for plant and equipment, which was largely attributable to purchases associated with our low- and zero-carbon hydrogen projects, as well as ongoing maintenance capital spending. Higher spending for plant and equipment was partially offset by lower investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, as the second phase of our investment in JIGPC of $908 in fiscal year 2023 was lower than the initial investment of $1.6 billion completed in fiscal year 2022. These investments included approximately $130 and $73 in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, received from a noncontrolling partner in one of our subsidiaries. We expect to complete a remaining investment of approximately $115. Refer to Note 9, Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Fiscal year 2023 also included an investment in financing receivables of $665.1, primarily for progress payments towards the purchase of a natural gas-to-syngas processing facility in Uzbekistan. Refer to Note 5, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Outlook for Investing ActivitiesIt is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 to be approximately $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion, which is driven by clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel projects such as those being executed in California and Louisiana, United States, as well as Alberta, Canada. We anticipate capital expenditures to be funded with our current cash balance, cash generated from continuing operations, and additional financing activities.As of the end of fiscal year 2023, we have committed capital of approximately $15 billion to projects intended to accelerate the energy transition. These low- and zero-carbon hydrogen and other first mover projects demonstrate our commitment to making investments that will make a meaningful difference on climate issues, allowing us to support our customers’ sustainability journeys, conserve resources, and care for our employees and communities.Cash Flows From Financing ActivitiesFiscal Year Ended 30 September20232022Long-term debt proceeds$3,516.2 $766.2 Payments on long-term debt(615.4)(400.0)Net increase in commercial paper and short-term borrowings268.2 17.9 Dividends paid to shareholders(1,496.6)(1,383.3)Proceeds from stock option exercises 24.0 19.3 Investments by noncontrolling interests234.9 21.0 Distributions to noncontrolling interests(115.9)(4.8)Other financing activities(205.8)(36.9)Cash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities$1,609.6 ($1,000.6)In fiscal year 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $1,609.6. As further discussed below, the source of cash was primarily attributable to long-term debt proceeds of $3,516.2 as well as an increase in commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $268.2. These cash inflows were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of $1,496.6 and payments on long-term debt of $615.4.The long-term debt proceeds included proceeds from our inaugural multi-currency green bonds that were issued during the second quarter in concurrent U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate note offerings with aggregate principal amounts of $600 and €700 million, respectively. Consistent with our Green Finance Framework, we have allocated the net proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, existing or future projects that are expected to have environmental benefits, including those related to pollution prevention and control, renewable energy generation and procurement, and sustainable aviation fuel. We expect to issue our first allocation report in 2024. Additionally, as further discussed below, the NGHC joint venture borrowed approximately $1.4 billion. These proceeds were partially offset by financing fees of approximately $150, which are reflected within ""Other financing activities"". Refer to the Credit Facilities section below as well as Note 16, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.41Table of ContentsIn fiscal year 2022, cash used for financing activities was $1,000.6. The use of cash was primarily driven by dividend payments to shareholders of $1,383.3 and payments on long-term debt of $400.0 for the repayment of a 3.0% Senior Note. These uses of cash were partially offset by long-term debt proceeds and short-term borrowings of $766.2 and $17.9, respectively. Financing and Capital StructureTotal debt increased from $7,644.8 as of 30 September 2022 to $10,305.8 as of 30 September 2023, primarily due to non-recourse project financing secured by the NGHC joint venture for construction of the NEOM Green Hydrogen project, issuance of our inaugural green U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes, and an increase in outstanding commercial paper. Total debt includes related party debt of $328.3 and $781.0 as of 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022, respectively. Various debt agreements to which we are a party include financial covenants and other restrictions, including restrictions pertaining to the ability to create property liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. As of 30 September 2023, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.2021 Credit AgreementWe have a five-year $2.75 billion revolving credit agreement maturing 31 March 2026 with a syndicate of banks (the “2021 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2023. At this time, we do not expect to access the facility for additional liquidity.The only financial covenant in the 2021 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (equal to total debt plus total equity) not to exceed 70%. The 2021 Credit Agreement defines total debt as the aggregate principal amount of all indebtedness, excluding limited recourse debt of any project finance subsidiary. Accordingly, this calculation does not consider borrowings associated with NGHC. Total debt to total capitalization was 36.6% and 35.8% as of 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022, respectively. Foreign Credit FacilitiesWe also have credit facilities available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries totaling $1,596.8, of which $1,041.4 was borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2023. The amount borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2022 was $457.5. The increase from 30 September 2022 was driven by borrowings on a new variable-rate Saudi Riyal loan facility that matures in October 2026. The interest rate on the facility is based on the Saudi Arabian Interbank Offered Rate plus an annual margin of 1.35%. We entered into this facility in October 2022 and utilized a portion of the proceeds to repay a variable-rate 4.10% Saudi Riyal Loan Facility of $195.6, which was presented within long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet as of 30 September 2022.NEOM Green Hydrogen Project FinancingIn May 2023, NGHC secured non-recourse project financing of approximately $6.1 billion, which is expected to fund approximately 73% of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project and will be drawn over the construction period. At the same time, NGHC secured additional non-recourse credit facilities totaling approximately $500 primarily for working capital needs. As of 30 September 2023, the joint venture had borrowed $1.4 billion of the available financing. Refer to Note 3, Variable Interest Entities, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. DividendsThe Board of Directors determines whether to declare cash dividends on our common stock and the timing and amount based on financial condition and other factors it deems relevant. In fiscal year 2023, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $1.75 per share, representing an 8% increase, or $0.13 per share, from the previous dividend of $1.62 per share. We expect to continue increasing our quarterly dividend as we have done for the last 41 consecutive years.Dividends are paid quarterly, usually during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. On 21 July 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per share that was payable on 13 November 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 2 October 2023. On 15 November 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per share that is payable on 12 February 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 2 January 2024.Discontinued OperationsIn fiscal years 2023 and 2022, cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of $0.6 and $59.6, respectively, resulted from cash received as part of state tax refunds related to the sale of our former Performance Materials Division in fiscal year 2017.42Table of ContentsPENSION BENEFITSWe and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. For additional information, refer to Note 17, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements.Net Periodic Cost (Benefit)The table below summarizes the components of net periodic cost/benefit for our U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans for the fiscal years ended 30 September:20232022Service cost$23.2 $39.8 Non-service related costs (benefits)86.8 (44.7)Other0.9 1.3 Net Periodic Cost (Benefit)$110.9 ($3.6)Net periodic cost was $110.9 in fiscal year 2023 versus a benefit of $3.6 in the prior year. The increased costs from the prior year were primarily attributable to higher non-service costs, which were driven by higher interest cost and lower expected returns on plan assets due to a smaller beginning balance of plan assets. The net impact of non-service related items are reflected within ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on our consolidated income statements.Service costs result from benefits earned by active employees and are reflected as operating expenses primarily within ""Cost of sales"" and ""Selling and administrative expense"" on our consolidated income statements. The amount of service costs capitalized in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was not material.The table below summarizes the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic cost/benefit for the fiscal years ended 30 September:20232022Weighted average discount rate – Service cost5.1 %2.4 %Weighted average discount rate – Interest cost 5.3 %2.0 %Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets5.3 %5.1 %Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase3.5 %3.4 %2024 OutlookIn fiscal year 2024, we expect to recognize pension expense of approximately $120 to $130 primarily driven by approximately $100 to $110 of non-service related costs, including lower estimated expected returns on plan assets due to a smaller beginning balance of plan assets and higher interest cost, partially offset by a decrease in actuarial loss amortization.In fiscal year 2023, we recognized net actuarial losses of $4.4 in other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets could impact the actuarial gain or loss and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2024.43Table of ContentsPension FundingFunded StatusThe projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future salary increases. The plan funded status is calculated as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at the end of the period.The table below summarizes the projected benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status for our U.S. and international plans as of 30 September:20232022Projected benefit obligation$3,511.2 $3,588.3 Fair value of plan assets at end of year3,433.0 3,526.0 Plan Funded Status($78.2)($62.3)The net unfunded liability of $78.2 as of 30 September 2023 increased $15.9 from $62.3 as of 30 September 2022, as increases to the projected benefit obligation from the service and interest cost components of net period pension cost were greater than actuarial gains from higher discount rates. Company ContributionsPension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2023 and 2022, our cash contributions to funded pension plans and benefit payments for unfunded pension plans were $32.6 and $44.7, respectively.For fiscal year 2024, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $35 to $45. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESRefer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies, and Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.The accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current and/or future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. If conditions change, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors.Depreciable Lives of Plant and EquipmentPlant and equipment, net at 30 September 2023 totaled $17,472.1, and depreciation expense totaled $1,325.8 during fiscal year 2023. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.44Table of ContentsThe estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business circumstances change. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.Our regional segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.Our regional segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. In addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. Impairment of AssetsThere were no triggering events in fiscal year 2023 that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups, reporting units that contain goodwill, or indefinite-lived intangibles assets. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment. Refer to the “Impairment of Assets” subsections below for additional detail. Impairment of Assets: Plant and EquipmentPlant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include:•a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping;•a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition;•an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset;•a reduction in revenues that is other than temporary;•a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping; or•changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.45Table of ContentsThe assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.In fiscal year 2023, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of our asset groupings may not be recoverable.Impairment of Assets: GoodwillThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $861.7 as of 30 September 2023. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 11, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five reportable business segments, seven operating segments and 11 reporting units, eight of which include a goodwill balance. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, for additional information. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments.As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. However, we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test, noting no indications of impairment. The fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.46Table of ContentsFuture events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, changes in the strategy of the reporting unit, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.Impairment of Assets: Intangible AssetsIntangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 September 2023 totaled $297.5 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under ""Impairment of Assets – Plant and Equipment"" for a description of how impairment losses are determined.Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2023 totaled $37.1 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.Disclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 12, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements.In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles, noting no indications of impairment.Impairment of Assets: Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $4,617.8 at 30 September 2023. The majority of our equity method investments are ventures with other industrial gas companies. Summarized financial information of our equity affiliates is included in Note 9, Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. We review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs. We estimate the fair value of our investments under the income approach, which considers the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee, and/or the market approach, which considers market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gas companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.In fiscal year 2023, there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.Revenue Recognition: Cost Incurred Input MethodRevenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule delays, technical issues, cost inflation, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.47Table of ContentsIn addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of engineering, project procurement, and construction activities, our sale of equipment projects within our Corporate and other segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $115 in fiscal year 2023 and $30 in fiscal year 2022. We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our contractual revenues and cost forecasts on these projects.Revenue Recognition: On-site Customer ContractsFor customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own, and operate on or near the customer’s facilities. Certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions regarding tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components, pricing provisions, and amendments, which require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As of 30 September 2023, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded as noncurrent, was $240.6, and net deferred tax liabilities were $1,106.4. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2023 were $96.5, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2023 was $551.2.Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in income tax expense.A 1% increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of approximately $29.Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.48Table of ContentsPension and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions, expense, and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans.Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 17, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. We measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. With respect to impacts on pension benefit obligations, a 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase, respectively, to pension expense of approximately $15 per year.The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase, respectively, to pension expense of approximately $17 per year.We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $4 per year.49Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the liability increases. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies, and Note 14, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties; interest rate swaps; cross currency interest rate swaps; and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the ""net financial instrument position"" and is disclosed in Note 15, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. Our net financial instrument position increased from a liability of $6,898.6 at 30 September 2022 to a liability of $8,990.8 at 30 September 2023. The increase was primarily due to NEOM Green Hydrogen Project financing and the issuance of U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes during the fiscal year.The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date, such as interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatility.50Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur debt portfolio as of 30 September 2023, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 80% fixed-rate debt and 20% variable-rate debt. Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2022, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 79% fixed-rate debt and 21% variable-rate debt.The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2023, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $728 and $364 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $845 and $425 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively.Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $21 and $16 of interest incurred per year at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $21 and $16 per year at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2023 and 2022, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $308 and $165 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in sensitivity is primarily due to the issuance of Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes during the fiscal year.The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.The majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the United States. Therefore, financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $55 and $20, respectively.51Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:14.875196

BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) serve customers in industrial, energy, technology, and healthcare markets. The Company offers a broad portfolio of atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, and equipment and services. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 40 countries, the Company has sales of $8.3 billion, assets of $13.0 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 18,900 employees. The Company organizes its operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. 2009 IN SUMMARY The beginning of fiscal 2009 coincided with the start of the global financial crisis, driving the recession that led to unprecedented declines in demand for the Company’s products worldwide. The downturn in the economy affected customers’ operating rates across most of our end markets. Globally, manufacturing declined 11%, and in Electronics, silicon processed decreased by about 35%. In response to these rapidly declining economic conditions around the world and to drive to a sustainable, low-cost structure, the Company implemented a global cost reduction plan. Impacted by these factors, the Company’s sales and operating income declined 21% and 43%, respectively. Additionally, unfavorable currency impacts, due to a stronger U.S. dollar contributed to the decline. The 2009 global cost reduction plan included the elimination of about 12% of the global workforce along with business exits and asset management actions. These initiatives lowered the Company’s cost structure, especially in the second half of the year. The planned actions are expected to be completed in fiscal 2010. Also, the Company implemented price increases and executed its initiatives for cost improvement by lowering discretionary spending. Sales were sequentially higher in the fourth quarter, and there was a greater than 200 basis point increase in the Company’s operating margin in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Overall, fiscal 2009 was a challenging year due to the impact of the global recession, but the actions taken by the Company helped to mitigate the adverse impact. 17 Table of Contents Highlights for 2009 • The Company implemented a global cost reduction plan designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses with the contracting global economy. Results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after-tax, or $.94 per share) for this plan. • The Company completed the divestiture of the U.S. Healthcare business. • The Company maintained a solid financial position throughout 2009. The current credit environment did not have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity. • Sales of $8,256.2 declined 21%. Underlying business declined 8% from lower volumes. Lower energy and raw material cost pass-through to customers and unfavorable currency negatively impacted sales by 7% and 6%, respectively. • Operating income of $846.3 declined $649.5, principally from lower volumes, the global cost reduction plan charge, and unfavorable currency impacts. • Income from continuing operations was $639.9 as compared to $1,090.5. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $3.00 as compared to $4.97. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented below. • Loss from discontinued operations was $8.6 as compared to $180.8. The prior year included an after-tax impairment charge of $246.2 related to the U.S. Healthcare business and an after-tax gain of $76.2 from the sale of the Polymer Emulsions business. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to the Company’s 2010 Outlook discussions provided throughout the Management’s Discussion and Analysis that follows.

The Company anticipates global manufacturing growth of 1%—2% in 2010. In the U.S., growth is expected to be flat to slightly positive by 1%. Europe is expected to be flat. Asia, led by China, is expected to be the strongest region, growing at a projected 6%—7%. Looking forward, the Company will continue to focus on improving its operating margin and return on capital through volume growth, effective cost management, and implementation of price increases. Capacity utilization rates in 2010 should improve as the economy recovers and through expansion of technology applications. Earnings should benefit from new plant startups in 2009 and 2010 along with a full-year impact of the 2009 global cost reduction plan. The Company will also remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs, and staffing. However, pension expense will be higher next year as a result of a decline in the discount rates used to determine the 2010 expense. Outlook by Segment • The Company is projecting Merchant Gases results to be higher based on a modest recovery in global manufacturing. Margins should improve based on higher volumes and cost reduction efforts. In 2009, the segment took steps to restructure the organization and to reduce costs in order to drive productivity and growth. • Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from new contracts and plants coming on-stream, and increased capacity utilization as chemical and steel markets continue to recover. • In Electronics, the Company projects silicon growth of 10%—15%, higher demand from flat panel producers, and accelerated growth in thin film photovoltaic. The business repositioning efforts should result in additional ongoing restructuring costs, while price pressure for certain electronics materials is expected to remain until capacity utilization improves. Growth is anticipated in Performance Materials as the Company should continue to benefit from new market and application successes, regional investment, and new product introductions. • Equipment and Energy results are expected to be comparable to 2009 levels. Two to three LNG orders are expected to be signed in fiscal 2010. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 8,256.2 $ 10,414.5 $ 9,148.2 Operating income 846.3 1,495.8 1,375.6 Equity affiliates’ income 112.2 145.0 114.4 Sales % Change from Prior Year 2009 2008 Underlying business Volume (9 )% 2 % Price 1 % 2 % Acquisitions/divestitures — 1 % Currency (6 )% 4 % Energy and raw material cost pass-through (7 )% 5 % Total Consolidated Sales Change (21 )% 14 % 2009 vs. 2008 Sales of $8,256.2 decreased 21%, or $2,158.3. Underlying business declined 8%, due to lower volumes primarily in Electronics and Performance Materials, Merchant Gases, and Tonnage Gases. Volumes were impacted by the severity of the worldwide manufacturing downturn and a significant decline in silicon processed. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 6%, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers reduced sales by 7%. 19 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Sales of $10,414.5 increased 14%, or $1,266.3. Underlying base business growth accounted for 4% of the increase. Sales increased 2% as higher volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials, Merchant Gases, and Tonnage Gases were partially offset by lower Equipment and Energy activity. Improved pricing, principally in Merchant Gases, increased sales by 2%. Sales improved 4% from favorable currency effects, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 5%. Operating Income 2009 vs. 2008 Operating income of $846.3 decreased 43%, or $649.5. • The global cost reduction plan charge reduced operating income by $298. • Underlying business declined $254, due primarily to lower volumes in the Merchant Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Tonnage Gases segments. The volume declines of $490 were partially offset by favorable cost performance of $157 and improved pricing of $79. • Unfavorable currency impacts lowered operating income by $113, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. • The write-off of certain receivables due to a customer bankruptcy and asset actions reduced operating income by $32. • Lower pension settlement charges favorably impacted operating income by $20. • Prior year operating income included unfavorable impacts of $28 due to hurricanes and a fire at a production facility. 2008 vs. 2007 Operating income of $1,495.8 increased 9%, or $120.2. • Higher volumes in the Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, and Electronics and Performance Materials segments, partially offset by a decrease in Equipment and Energy activity, increased operating income by $82. • Improved pricing, net of variable costs, increased operating income by $21, as pricing increases in Merchant Gases were partially offset by lower pricing in electronics specialty materials. • Favorable currency effects, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, increased operating income by $80. • 2007 included a gain of $37 from a settlement of a supply contract termination. • Higher pension settlement charges negatively impacted operating income by $20. • Unfavorable impacts caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, and the fire at an Electronics production facility in Korea, decreased operating income by $28. Equity Affiliates’ Income 2009 vs. 2008 Income from equity affiliates of $112.2 decreased $32.8, or 23%, primarily as a result of lower overall volumes and unfavorable currency. Additionally, prior year results included favorable adjustments made to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. 2008 vs. 2007 Income from equity affiliates of $145.0 increased $30.6, or 27%. This increase resulted from solid underlying growth, increased nitrogen injection volumes in Mexico, the benefit of adjustments to certain affiliates, and the reversal of an antitrust fine. 20 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expense (S&A) 2009 vs. 2008 S&A expense of $943.4 decreased $147.0, or 13%. Underlying costs decreased 8%, primarily due to improved productivity as well as the impact of the global cost reduction plan, lower incentive compensation costs, and lower discretionary spending. This decrease was partially offset by inflation and higher bad debt expense. Favorable currency impacts, primarily the strengthening of the dollar against the Euro and Pound Sterling, decreased S&A by 6%. The acquisition of CryoService Limited in the third quarter of 2008 increased S&A by 1%. S&A as a percent of sales, increased to 11.4% from 10.5%, due principally to the impact of lower energy and raw material cost pass-through on sales. 2008 vs. 2007 S&A expense of $1,090.4 increased 9%, or $90.6. S&A increased 2% from the acquisition of the Polish industrial gas business of BOC Gazy Sp z o.o. (BOC Gazy) in the third quarter of 2007. Currency effects, driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, increased S&A by 4%. Underlying costs increased S&A by 3%, as productivity gains were more than offset by inflation and higher costs to support growth. S&A as a percent of sales declined to 10.5% from 10.9%. 2010 Outlook S&A expense for 2010 will reflect higher pension expense and modest cost inflation. These increases should be offset by cost savings arising from the benefits of the global cost reduction plan initiated in 2009 and ongoing productivity initiatives. Research and Development (R&D) 2009 vs. 2008 R&D expense of $116.3 decreased $14.4, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. R&D increased as a percent of sales to 1.4% from 1.3%. 2008 vs. 2007 R&D expense of $130.7 increased $1.7. R&D decreased as a percent of sales to 1.3% from 1.4%. 2010 Outlook R&D expense is expected to be moderately higher in 2010. Global Cost Reduction Plan 2009 The 2009 results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after-tax, or $.94 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company announced the global cost reduction plan, designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. In the third quarter of 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, the Company committed to additional actions associated with its global cost reduction plan. The 2009 charge included $210.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension-related costs, associated with the elimination of approximately 2,550 positions from the Company’s global workforce. The remainder of this charge, $88.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. Cost savings of approximately $50 were realized in 2009, and cost savings of approximately $155 are expected for 2010. Beyond 2010, the Company expects annualized savings of approximately $180, of which the majority is related to personnel costs. 2007 The 2007 results from continuing operations included a charge of $13.7 ($8.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share) for a global cost reduction plan. The charge included $6.5 for severance and pension-related costs for the elimination of approximately 125 positions and $7.2 for the write-down of certain investments. As of 30 September 2008, the actions associated with the 2007 charge were complete. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these charges. 21 Table of Contents 2007 Customer Contract Settlement In 2007, the Company entered into a settlement with a customer to resolve a dispute related to a dinitrotoluene (DNT) supply agreement. As part of the settlement agreement, the DNT supply agreement was terminated, and certain other agreements between the companies were amended. As a result, the Company recognized a before-tax gain of $36.8 ($23.6 after-tax, or $.11 per share). 2009 Customer Bankruptcy and Asset Actions In 2009, the Company recognized charges totaling $32.1 ($21.0 after-tax, or $.10 per share) related to a customer bankruptcy and asset actions for the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. Refer to Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension Settlement The Company’s supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the participant’s retirement date. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. Based on the timing of when cash payments were made, the Company recognized $10.7, $30.3, and $10.3 of settlement charges in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Income, Net Items recorded to other income arise from transactions and events not directly related to the principal income earning activities of the Company. The detail of other income is presented in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2009 vs. 2008 Other income of $23.0 decreased by $2.8. Other income declined due to losses from asset sales in the current year and unfavorable foreign exchange. Other income in 2008 included a loss related to fire damage at a production facility. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. 2008 vs. 2007 Other income of $25.8 decreased by $16.5. Other income in 2008 included a loss of $14.7 related to fire damage at an Electronics production facility in Korea, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange of $8.1. Other income in 2007 included a gain of $23.7 on the sale of assets. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. Interest Expense 2009 2008 2007 Interest incurred $ 143.8 $ 184.1 $ 175.3 Less: Capitalized interest 21.9 22.1 12.9 Interest Expense $ 121.9 $ 162.0 $ 162.4 2009 vs. 2008 Interest incurred decreased by $40.3. This decrease was primarily driven by lower average interest rates on variable rate debt. The impact of a stronger dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest was offset by a higher average debt balance. Capitalized interest was comparable to the prior year due to slightly higher project levels offset by lower average interest rates. 2008 vs. 2007 Interest incurred increased by $8.8. The increase resulted from a higher average debt balance, excluding currency effects, and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest, partially offset by lower average interest rates. Capitalized interest increased by $9.2, primarily due to increased project levels in the Tonnage Gases segment. 2010 Outlook The Company expects interest incurred to be modestly higher. This increase is expected to result from a higher average debt balance and higher expected average interest rates. 22 Table of Contents Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes, less minority interest. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2009 vs. 2008 The effective tax rate was 22.5% and 25.1% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate declined, as tax credits had a higher relative impact due to lower book taxable income. 2008 vs. 2007 The effective tax rate was 25.1% and 22.0% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. A tax benefit associated with foreign operations and other higher credits and adjustments from the Company’s ongoing tax planning process were included in the 2008 effective rate. The 2007 tax rate included the settlement of tax audits and related interest income, combined with the donation of a portion of a cost-based investment. The net impact was a 3.1% higher tax rate in 2008. 2010 Outlook The Company expects the effective tax rate in 2010 to be approximately 25.5% to 26.0%. Discontinued Operations The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. U.S. Healthcare In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of the U.S. Healthcare business. In the first half of 2009, based on additional facts, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share), reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the business. Also, tax benefits of $25.5, or $.12 per share, were recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit associated with the total impairment charges recorded. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company sold more than half of its remaining U.S. Healthcare business to OptionCare Enterprises, Inc., a subsidiary of Walgreen Co., and Landauer-Metropolitan, Inc. (LMI) for combined cash proceeds of $38.1. The Company recognized an after-tax gain of $.3 resulting from these sales combined with adjustments to the net realizable value of the remaining businesses. During the fourth quarter of 2009, through a series of transactions with Rotech Healthcare, Inc. and with LMI, the Company sold its remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $12.1. A net after-tax loss of $.7 was recognized. These transactions completed the disposal of the U.S. Healthcare business. The U.S. Healthcare business generated sales of $125.2, $239.8, and $271.1, and a loss from operations, net of tax, of $3.4, $259.4, and $15.2 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The loss from operations in 2008 included an after-tax impairment charge of $237.0. Polymer Emulsions Business On 31 January 2008, the Company closed on the sale of its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. As part of that agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AG’s interest in the Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $89.5 ($57.7 after-tax, or $.26 per share). On 30 June 2008, the Company sold its Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses to Ashland, Inc. The Company recorded a gain of $30.5 ($18.5 after-tax, or $.08 per share) in connection with the sale, which included the recording of a retained environmental obligation associated with the Piedmont site. The sale of the Elkton and Piedmont facilities completed the disposal of the Company’s Polymer Emulsions business. 23 Table of Contents The Polymer Emulsion business generated sales of $261.4 and $618.6, and income from operations, net of tax, of $11.3 and $38.3 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. HPPC Business In 2008, the Company sold its HPPC business to KMG Chemicals, Inc. The Company wrote down the assets of the business to net realizable value as of 30 September 2007, resulting in a loss of $15.3 ($9.3 after-tax, or $.04 per share). The sale closed on 31 December 2007, and an additional loss on the sale was recorded of $.5 ($.3 after-tax) in 2008. The HPPC business generated sales of $22.9 and $87.2 and income from operations, net of tax, of $.1 and $2.2 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net Income 2009 vs. 2008 Net income was $631.3, compared to $909.7 in 2008. Diluted earnings per share was $2.96 compared to $4.15 in 2008. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented on page 18. 2008 vs. 2007 Net income was $909.7, compared to $1,035.6 in 2007. Diluted earnings per share was $4.15, compared to $4.64 in 2007. Segment Analysis Merchant Gases 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 3,610.6 $ 4,192.7 $ 3,556.9 Operating income 661.2 789.5 656.4 Equity affiliates’ income 98.3 131.8 97.8 Merchant Gases Sales % Change from Prior Year 2009 2008 Underlying business Volume (9 )% 4 % Price 4 % 4 % Acquisitions/divestitures — 3 % Currency (9 )% 7 % Total Merchant Gases Sales Change (14 )% 18 % 2009 vs. 2008 Merchant Gases Sales Sales of $3,610.6 decreased by 14%, or $582.1. Sales decreased 9% from unfavorable currency effects, driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. Underlying sales declined 5%, with volumes down 9% and pricing up 4%. Volumes were weak across manufacturing end markets globally. Price increases implemented early in the year were effective, partially offsetting the decline in volume. The global recession significantly impacted manufacturing-related demand for Merchant industrial gases in every region. In North America, sales decreased 10%, with volumes down 14%. Higher pricing of 4% partially offset the decline in volumes. In Europe, sales decreased 17%, primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts of 13%. Underlying sales declined 4%, with volumes down 8% and pricing adding 4%. Stronger healthcare volumes partially offset the total volume decline. In Asia, sales declined 13%. Underlying sales were lower by 6%, with volumes declining 8% and pricing adding 2%. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 7%. 24 Table of Contents Merchant Gases Operating Income Operating income of $661.2 decreased 16%, or $128.3. The decline was due to reduced volumes of $234 and unfavorable currency impacts of $74. These declines were partially offset by improved pricing, net of variable costs, of $102 and improved cost performance of $78, primarily due to cost reduction efforts. Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates’ Income Merchant Gases equity affiliates’ income of $98.3 decreased 25%, or $33.5. The decline was a result of lower overall volumes and unfavorable currency. Additionally, prior year results included favorable adjustments made to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. 2008 vs. 2007 Merchant Gases Sales Sales of $4,192.7 increased 18%, or $635.8. Higher volumes across all regions increased sales by 4%. Volumes increased in North America due to record new signings in 2008 and continued strong demand for liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid nitrogen (LIN). Volume gains in Europe were primarily due to a higher number of Healthcare patients served. In Asia, volumes were higher in generated gases, liquid argon, and liquid helium. Higher prices increased sales by 4% as a result of actions taken to recover higher power, distribution, and other manufacturing costs in North America and Europe. Sales increased by 3% from the full-year impact of the acquisition of BOC Gazy in 2007. In addition, sales increased 7% due to favorable currency impacts, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Merchant Gases Operating Income Operating income of $789.5 increased by 20%, or $133.1. Favorable operating income variances resulted from improved pricing of $75, higher volumes of $60, and currency effects of $51. Operating income declined by $49 from higher distribution costs and inflation. Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates’ Income Equity affiliates’ income of $131.8 increased 35%, or $34.0, reflecting higher income in all regions. The increases were due to solid underlying growth, increased nitrogen injection volumes in Mexico, and the benefit of adjustments to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. Tonnage Gases 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 2,573.6 $ 3,574.4 $ 2,936.7 Operating income 399.6 482.6 426.4 Tonnage Gases Sales % Change from Prior Year 2009 2008 Underlying business Volume (5 )% 2 % Acquisitions/divestitures — 1 % Currency (4 )% 3 % Energy and raw material cost pass-through (19 )% 16 % Total Tonnage Gases Sales Change (28 )% 22 % 2009 vs. 2008 Tonnage Gases Sales Sales of $2,573.6 decreased 28%, or $1,000.8. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers reduced sales by 19%. Volumes were down 5%. While refinery hydrogen volumes were higher, overall volumes declined from reduced demand from steel and chemical customers. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 4%. 25 Table of Contents Tonnage Gases Operating Income Operating income of $399.6 decreased 17%, or $83.0. Underlying business declined $70, primarily from decreased volumes and lower operating efficiencies. Currency unfavorably impacted operating income by $24. Prior year included unfavorable hurricane related impacts of $11. 2008 vs. 2007 Tonnage Gases Sales Sales of $3,574.4 increased 22%, or $637.7. Higher energy and raw material cost pass-through accounted for 16% of sales growth in 2008. Volume growth in the underlying business increased sales by 4%, primarily due to new plant start-ups in Asia and Canada, offset by a decline of 2% due to the impacts from hurricane-related business interruption. The acquisition of BOC Gazy in the third quarter of 2007 improved sales by 1%. Sales increased 3% from favorable currency effects, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Tonnage Gases Operating Income Operating income of $482.6 increased 13%, or $56.2. Operating income increased by $20 from higher volumes, $9 from favorable currency effects, and $30 from lower operating costs. Operating income decreased by $11 as a result of hurricane-related impacts. Electronics and Performance Materials 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 1,582.2 $ 2,209.3 $ 2,068.7 Operating income 101.6 245.9 229.2 Electronics and Performance Materials Sales % Change from Prior Year 2009 2008 Underlying business Volume (25 )% 5 % Price (2 )% — Acquisition/divestiture 1 % — Currency (2 )% 2 % Total Electronics and Performance Materials Sales Change (28 )% 7 % 2009 vs. 2008 Electronics and Performance Materials Sales Sales of $1,582.2 declined 28%, or $627.1, as volumes declined 25%. Sales volumes declined significantly in the first half of 2009 and recovered sequentially in the second half. In Electronics, sales were down 35%, reflecting a significant global downturn in semiconductor and flat panel capacity utilization and capital investment. In Performance Materials, sales were down 19% due to weaker demand across all end markets, partially offset by improved pricing. Electronics and Performance Materials Operating Income Operating income of $101.6 declined by 59%, or $144.3. Operating income declined from lower volumes of $202 as well as unfavorable pricing of $37. Lower pricing in Electronics was partially offset by higher pricing in Performance Materials. Favorable cost performance added $82, primarily due to cost reduction efforts. Results in 2008 included $15 of unfavorable impacts associated with a fire at a production facility. 2008 vs. 2007 Electronics and Performance Materials Sales Sales of $2,209.3 increased 7%, or $140.6. Underlying base business growth increased sales by 5%. In Electronics, higher volumes in specialty materials and tonnage gases were partially offset by lower equipment sales and softer volumes due to product rationalization. Higher volumes across Asia and in some key market segments in North America increased sales in Performance Materials. Pricing was flat, as improvements in Performance Materials were offset by lower pricing in electronic specialty materials. Favorable currency effects, primarily the weakening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies, improved sales by 2%. 26 Table of Contents Electronics and Performance Materials Operating Income Operating income of $245.9 increased 7%, or $16.7. Operating income increased $48 from higher volumes, $19 from lower operating costs, and $18 from favorable currency effects, partially offset by property damage of $15 caused by a fire at an Electronics production facility in Korea. Operating income also declined by $51 from lower electronic specialty materials pricing, net of variable costs. Equipment and Energy 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 489.8 $ 438.1 $ 585.9 Operating income 42.2 38.9 76.8 2009 vs. 2008 Sales of $489.8 increased by 12%, or $51.7, due to higher air separation unit (ASU) activity. Operating income improved $3.3 from favorable cost performance and higher ASU sales, partially offset by lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchanger activity and unfavorable currency. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2009 was $239, compared to $399 at 30 September 2008. It is expected that approximately $203 of the backlog will be completed during 2010. 2008 vs. 2007 Sales of $438.1 decreased by 25%, or $147.8, primarily from lower LNG activity and a one-time energy-related equipment sale that occurred in 2007. Operating income of $38.9 decreased by $37.9, primarily from lower LNG heat exchanger activity. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2008 was $399, compared to $258 at 30 September 2007. Other Other operating income (loss) includes expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income, and costs previously allocated to businesses now reported as discontinued operations. Also included are LIFO inventory adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO and the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate general and administrative costs and research and development costs are fully allocated to the business segments. 2009 2008 2007 Operating (loss) $ (17.3 ) $ (30.8 ) $ (26.0 ) 2009 vs. 2008 Operating loss of $17.3 decreased by $13.5. The decrease is primarily due to favorable LIFO inventory adjustments versus the prior year. Unfavorable currency partially offset this decline. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. 2008 vs. 2007 Operating loss of $30.8 increased by $4.8. No items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. 27 Table of Contents PENSION BENEFITS The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans—the U.S. Salaried Pension Plan and the U.K. Pension Plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. The move to defined contribution plans has not had a material impact on retirement program cost levels or funding. Over the long run, however, the new defined contribution plans are expected to reduce volatility of both expense and contributions. For 2009, the fair market value of pension plan assets for the Company’s defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $2,251.0 from $2,218.2 in 2008. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $3,386.0 and $2,731.7 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the obligation was due principally to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to measure future benefit obligations to 5.6% from 7.1%. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on the Company’s postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2009 2008 2007 Pension expense $ 110.0 $ 127.0 $ 138.5 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 43.8 31.5 12.3 Weighted average discount rate 7.1 % 6.1 % 5.7 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 8.3 % 8.8 % 8.8 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 4.3 % 4.2 % 4.1 % 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in pension expense was primarily attributable to the 100 basis point increase in the weighted average discount rate. Expense in 2009 included $43.8 of special termination, settlement, and curtailment charges, of which $32.3 was related to the global cost reduction plan. 2008 vs. 2007 The decrease in pension expense was primarily attributable to the 40 basis point increase in the weighted average discount rate. Expense included $31.5 in 2008 and $12.3 in 2007 for special termination, settlement, and curtailment charges. 2010 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $125 in 2010, an increase of $15. Expense in 2009 included $43.8 of special termination, settlement, and curtailment charges. In 2010, pension expense will include approximately $64 for amortization of actuarial losses versus $17 in 2009. Actuarial losses of $739.2 were incurred in 2009, resulting primarily from a lower discount rate used to determine the 2010 expense and actual asset returns below expected returns. Actuarial gains/losses, in excess of certain thresholds, are amortized into pension expense over the average remaining service lives of the employees to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2010. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans. With respect to funded plans, the Company’s funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, the Company makes contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing its capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. The Company analyzes the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2009 and 2008, the Company’s cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans were $184.8 and $234.0, respectively. The majority of the cash contributions were voluntary. Cash contributions and benefit payments for defined benefit plans are estimated to be approximately $360 in 2010. Of this amount, $200 has been contributed in October 2009. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 33 for a projection of future contributions. 28 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, the Company is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. The Company’s accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations on an after-tax basis related to environmental matters totaled $32.6, $31.0, and $25.1 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, the Company estimates that in 2009, it spent approximately $6 on capital projects to control pollution versus $7 in 2008. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $7 in both 2010 and 2011. The Company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $95 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $109. The balance sheet at 30 September 2009 and 2008 included an accrual of $95.0 and $82.9, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and the Paulsboro, New Jersey facilities is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of the Company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in California and Ontario. In the U.S., regional initiatives have been implemented that will regulate GHG emissions from fossil fuel-driven power plants, and some federal legislative proposals also focus on such power plants. As a large consumer of electric power, the Company could be impacted by increased costs that may arise from such regulatory controls. In addition, federal legislation has been introduced in the U.S. that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions from the Company’s hydrogen facilities and other operations, such as production of fluorinated gases manufactured by the Company. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHGs. The Company may incur costs related to GHG emissions from its hydrogen facilities and other operations such as fluorinated gases production. The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through its contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from Company facilities could impact the Company’s growth by increasing its operating costs or reducing demand for certain of its products. Regulation of GHGs may also produce new opportunities for the Company. The Company continues to develop technologies to help its facilities and its customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. The Company is also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and the Company’s carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of the Company’s main products, and the Company’s proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. 29 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company maintained a solid financial position throughout 2009. Cash flow from operations, supplemented with proceeds from borrowings, provided funding for the Company’s capital spending and dividend payments. The Company continues to maintain debt ratings of A/A2 (long-term) and A-1/P-1 (short-term), by Standard & Poor’s/Moody’s and retained consistent access to commercial paper markets throughout the year. The Company’s cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table: 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 1,322.9 $ 1,679.6 $ 1,499.9 Investing activities (1,040.4 ) (919.8 ) (1,483.1 ) Financing activities 101.5 (698.5 ) (14.9 ) Operating Activities 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $356.7, or 21%. The decrease resulted from the reduction in net income of $278.4 combined with the unfavorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $170.7, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of $92.4. Noncash adjustments include depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, and share-based compensation cost. These adjustments also include changes in operating assets, such as noncurrent capital lease receivables, and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt or disbursement of cash and their recognition in earnings. Net income in 2009 included noncash impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, U.S. Healthcare noncash impairment charges totaling $314.8 were partially offset by gains of $105.9 on the sale of discontinued operations. Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses are reflected as an investing activity. Changes in working capital decreased cash used (positive cash flow variance) by $92.4 and included: • A $256.4 positive cash flow variance due to lower trade receivables as a result of lower sales. • A $108.7 positive cash flow variance from other receivables due primarily to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 2008 related to the U.S. Healthcare impairment charge. The recognition of this asset represented a use of cash in 2008. • A $319.0 negative cash flow variance due to a higher use of cash for payables and accrued liabilities. This variance was due to a lower level of activity and the timing of payments. 2008 vs. 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $179.7, or 12%. The increase resulted principally from a decrease in the use of cash for working capital of $218.1. The decline in net income of $125.9 was offset by the favorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $87.5. Net income in 2008 included a noncash impairment charge of $314.8 related to the U.S. Healthcare business. Net income in 2008 also included a gain of $105.9 related to the sale of discontinued operations, and adjustments to income included an increase in noncurrent capital lease receivables of $121.8. Changes in working capital decreased cash used (positive cash flow variance) by $218.1 and included: • A $255.7 positive cash flow variance for payables and accrued liabilities due mainly to an increase in customer advances related to equipment sales, lower pension plan contributions, and the timing of payments. • A $156.5 positive cash flow variance due to a reduction in contracts in progress resulting from lower equipment activity. • A $97.2 negative cash flow variance from higher trade receivables due primarily to higher sales, offset partially by increased collections. • A $77.5 negative cash flow variance from other receivables resulting from the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the U.S. Healthcare impairment charge. 30 Table of Contents Investing Activities 2009 vs. 2008 Cash used for investing increased $120.6, primarily from lower proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $372.0, partially offset by changes in restricted cash of $270.6. • During 2009, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. Healthcare business, which generated proceeds of $51.0. Prior year proceeds of $423.0 included the sales of the Polymer Emulsions and HPPC businesses. • Decreases in the restricted cash balances, caused by project spending exceeding new bond proceeds, resulted in a source of cash of $87.0 in 2009. Prior year activity resulted in a use of cash of $183.6. The proceeds from the issuance of certain Industrial Revenue Bonds must be held in escrow until related project spending occurs and are classified as noncurrent assets in the balance sheet. 2008 vs. 2007 Cash used for investing decreased $563.3, principally from lower acquisitions of $467.1 and proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $423.0, partially offset by changes in restricted cash of $183.6. Additionally, the proceeds from asset sales declined $77.6. • In 2007, the Company acquired BOC Gazy from The Linde Group for €380 million, or $518.4. • During 2008, the Company sold its Polymer Emulsions and HPPC businesses. • Additions to restricted cash, from the proceeds of bonds held in escrow, resulted in a use of cash of $183.6. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2009 2008 2007 Additions to plant and equipment $ 1,179.1 $ 1,085.1 $ 1,013.2 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 32.7 72.0 539.1 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 24.5 2.2 .2 Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis $ 1,236.3 $ 1,159.3 $ 1,552.5 Capital lease expenditures (A) 238.6 195.7 82.8 Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis $ 1,474.9 $ 1,355.0 $ 1,635.3 (A) The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which the Company’s management uses internally to evaluate and manage the Company’s expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2009 totaled $1,236.3, compared to $1,159.3 in 2008. Additions to plant and equipment in 2009 increased by $94.0 compared to 2008. Additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses during both 2009 and 2008. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2009 totaled $1,474.9, compared to $1,355.0 in 2008. Capital lease expenditures of $238.6 increased by $42.9, reflecting increased expenditures primarily in North America Tonnage Gases. In 2008, capital lease expenditures of $195.7 increased $112.9 from 2007, reflecting higher project spending, primarily in Europe and Asia. 2010 Outlook Capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2010 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,000 and $1,200, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,300 and $1,500. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with approximately $1,000 associated with new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, the Company intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. 31 Table of Contents Financing Activities 2009 vs. 2008 Cash provided by financing activities increased $800.0, primarily as a result of share repurchases of $793.4 in 2008. In 2009, the Company did not purchase any of its outstanding shares. 2008 vs. 2007 Cash used for financing activities increased $683.6, primarily due to: • A net decrease in borrowings of $299.5. Company borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) totaled $305.5 as compared to $605.0. • An increase in cash used for the purchase of treasury stock of $218.2. • Lower proceeds of $115.4 from stock option exercises. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2009 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2009, total debt outstanding was $4.5 billion compared to $4.0 billion, and cash and cash items were $.5 billion compared to $.1 billion. Total debt at 30 September 2009 and 2008, expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt, shareholders’ equity, and minority interest, was 47.7% and 43.4%, respectively. Long-term debt proceeds of $610.5 included $400.0 from the issuance of a fixed-rate 4.375% 10-year senior note and $158.8 from Industrial Revenue Bonds. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In September 2008, the Company increased the size of its multicurrency committed revolving credit facility, maturing May 2011, from $1,200 to $1,450. Fifteen major global banks provide commitments under this facility, and the Company is confident that funding would be available from these banks if it were necessary to draw on the facility. As of 30 September 2009, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility. Additional commitments of $396.6 are maintained by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, of which $294.8 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2009. There was no commercial paper outstanding at 30 September 2009. On 20 September 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding common stock. During 2009, the Company did not purchase any shares under this authorization. At 30 September 2009, $649.2 in share repurchase authorization remained. 2010 Outlook The Company projects a limited need to access the long-term debt markets in 2010 due to its projected operating cash flows and its available cash balance at the end of 2009. The Company expects that it will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. Dividends On 19 March 2009, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.44 per share to $.45 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. 32 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes these obligations of the Company as of 30 September 2009: Payments Due By Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $ 4,159 $ 452 $ 193 $ 455 $ 310 $ 469 $ 2,280 Contractual interest 765 128 122 108 88 69 250 Capital leases 11 3 2 1 1 1 3 Operating leases 227 58 45 32 26 22 44 Pension obligations 1,144 360 145 75 80 150 334 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,785 611 120 112 115 120 707 Total Contractual Obligations $ 8,091 $ 1,612 $ 627 $ 783 $ 620 $ 831 $ 3,618 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest the Company is contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. The Company had $1,413 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2009, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2009. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Most of the Company’s long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, the Company does not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. The above unconditional purchase obligations include other product supply commitments and also electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $369 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2010. The Company also purchases materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. In total, purchases by the Company approximate $6.4 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above. 33 Table of Contents Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2009 were $357.9. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2009 were $194.9. These tax liabilities were not included in the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. The Company does not have any derivative instruments indexed to its own stock. The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company’s principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. The Company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company’s earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is the Company’s policy to minimize its cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. The Company mitigates adverse energy price impacts through its cost pass-through contracts with customers, as well as price increases. The Company has entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oil-based feedstocks. The Company addresses these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company’s derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange-forward contracts, foreign exchange-option contracts, and commodity swaps. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position. The net financial instrument position does not include other investments of $19.4 at 30 September 2009 and $15.6 at 30 September 2008 as disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At 30 September 2009 and 2008, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $4,510 and $3,629, respectively. The increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the issuance of new long-term debt and the impact of lower interest rates on the market value of long-term debt. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Company’s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects the Company’s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by the Company using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date. 34 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The Company’s debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of 30 September 2009 primarily comprised debt denominated in Euros (49%) and U.S. dollars (37%), including the effect of currency swaps. This debt portfolio is composed of 55% fixed-rate debt and 45% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of the Company’s debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position. The sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the Company’s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2009, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $92 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2009. Based on the variable-rate debt included in the Company’s debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, as of 30 September 2009, a 100 basis point increase or decline in interest rates would result in an additional $20 of interest incurred or lower interest incurred by $20, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2009, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $369 in the net liability position of financial instruments. The primary currencies for which the Company has exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the U.S. dollar versus the Pound Sterling. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where the Company does business, thereby reducing its net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts are also used to hedge the Company’s firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows, along with foreign exchange-option contracts. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal (or more favorable in the case of purchased foreign exchange-option contracts) to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. Commodity Price Risk The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 50% change in the price of natural gas and oil-based feedstocks, at 30 September 2009, with all other variables held constant. The impact of a 50% change in these prices would not have a significant impact on the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2009. INFLATION The financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years’ inflation. While the U.S. inflation rate has been modest for several years, the Company operates in many countries with both inflation and currency issues. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing the Company’s plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the Company’s major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the Company’s accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. The Company’s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with its audit committee. 35 Table of Contents Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2009 totaled $6,859.6, and depreciation expense totaled $815.9 during 2009. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. The Company has numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease Life Increase Life By 1 Year By 1 Year Merchant Gases $ 20 $ (16 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $ 15 $ (13 ) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2009 totaled $6,859.6. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. 36 Table of Contents The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill The purchase method of accounting for business combinations currently requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $56.1, was $972.1 as of 30 September 2009. The majority of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company performs an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires the Company to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. The Company has designated its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, the Company has four business segments and fifteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. There were no indications of impairment. The Company primarily uses an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows, to determine fair value of a reporting unit. The Company’s valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by the Company’s reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in the Company’s income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in the Company’s operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. Intangible Assets Intangible assets at 30 September 2009 totaled $262.6 and consisted primarily of customer relationships that were acquired as part of business combinations. The Company has no acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $868.1 at 30 September 2009. The majority of the Company’s investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. 37 Table of Contents In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2009, accrued income taxes and deferred tax liabilities amounted to $42.9 and $357.9, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2009 were $194.9. Current and noncurrent deferred tax assets equaled $278.1 at 30 September 2009. Income tax expense was $185.3 for the year ended 30 September 2009. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in the Company’s effective tax rate would have decreased/increased net income by approximately $8. Pension Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. The Company determines assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. The Company believes the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. For the U.S. Plans, the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched with an interest rate curve applicable to the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate. In making this determination, the Company considers the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve, the general movement of interest rates, and the changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond 38 Table of Contents yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $20 per year. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on an estimated weighted average of long-term returns of major asset classes. In determining asset class returns, the Company takes into account long-term returns of major asset classes, historical performance of plan assets, and related value-added of active management, as well as the current interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined by an asset/ liability study that takes into account plan demographics, asset returns, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $12 per year. The Company uses a market-related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets. This method recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. The Company determines this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $12 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business the Company encounters contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the Company. The Company accrues a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which the Company’s accounting policy is discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and particulars are provided in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or the Company’s proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on the Company’s net income in the period in which it is recorded. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the Company’s implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. 39 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This document contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

All comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as noted. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for share data, unless otherwise indicated. Captions such as income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products and net income attributable to Air Products are simply referred to as “income from continuing operations” and “net income” throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise stated. The discussion of results that follows includes non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures exclude acquisition-related costs in 2010. For 2009, the non-GAAP measures exclude the global cost reduction plan charge, costs related to customer bankruptcy and asset actions and third quarter 2009 pension settlement costs. For 2008, the non-GAAP measures exclude pension settlement costs. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that the Company’s management uses internally to evaluate the Company’s baseline performance on a comparable basis. The reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures is presented on pages 28—29. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company or Air Products) serves technology, energy, industrial, and healthcare customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, equipment, and services. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 40 countries, the Company has sales of $9.0 billion, assets of $13.5 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 18,300 employees. The Company organizes its operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. 2010 IN SUMMARY In 2010, the Company emerged from the recession and delivered strong growth and productivity. Sales increased 9% and underlying sales increased 8%, due to strong volume growth as the economic environment improved. These results were driven by a significant recovery in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment and new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases segment. Operating income increased due to improved performance across all business segments. The Company delivered significant improvements in 2010 as a result of actions taken to lower costs and position the Company for success coming out of the global recession. These actions included the completion of the Company’s global cost reduction plans and Electronics business restructuring. Additionally, the Company repositioned its manufacturing centers, continued to leverage the SAP system, and further utilized its shared service centers. These actions contributed to increased productivity and improved operating results. 18 Table of Contents In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas). Airgas is the largest packaged industrial gases distributor in the U.S. Its fiscal year 2010 annual revenues were $3.9 and its total assets as of 31 March 2010 were $4.5. The current offer price is $65.50 per share. At this price, the total value of the transaction would be approximately $7.4 billion, including $5.7 billion of equity and $1.7 billon of assumed debt. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire on 3 December 2010, unless further extended. Highlights for 2010 • Sales of $9,026.0 increased 9%, or $769.8. Underlying business increased 8%, primarily due to higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. • Operating income of $1,389.0 increased 64%, or $542.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,485.0 increased 25%, or $300.4, primarily due to higher volumes, lower costs, and favorable currency and foreign exchange, partially offset by reduced pricing. • Income from continuing operations of $1,029.1 increased 61%, or $389.2, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.74 increased 58%, or $1.74. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,089.2 increased 26%, or $223.0, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.02 increased 24%, or $.96. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented below. • The Company increased the quarterly dividend from $.45 to $.49 per share. This represents the 28th consecutive year that the Company has increased its dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to the Company’s 2011 Outlook discussions provided throughout the Management’s Discussion and Analysis that follows.

The Company anticipates global manufacturing growth of 3%–4% in 2011, with stronger growth in Asia and more gradual recoveries in the U.S. and Europe. The Company expects the U.S. will have positive growth of 3%–4% in manufacturing. Europe should increase about 1%–2% and Asia, led by China, is expected to continue as the strongest region, growing at 6%–7%. Looking forward, the Company expects volume growth to be the key factor in driving earnings improvement in 2011. Earnings should benefit from new plant onstreams in 2010 and 2011, along with the loading of existing assets. These volume gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense next year, as a result of a decline in the discount rates from September 2009 to September 2010 and lower expected asset returns. Based upon current rates, the Company does not expect currency to have a significant impact on 2011 earnings. The Company will continue to focus on cost control and will achieve benefits from the cost reduction efforts completed. If the proposed acquisition of Airgas is consummated in 2011, material impacts affecting most items in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are expected. In addition, projections, estimates and plans described in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis would be materially impacted. Except where noted, the Outlook discussions provided throughout the Management’s Discussion and Analysis do not include any impacts of the proposed transaction. Outlook by Segment • Merchant Gases should benefit as capacity utilization of existing facilities continues to improve globally and as new demand develops, particularly in Asia. Global manufacturing growth, along with new technology applications should continue to increase demand which will drive the loading of facilities. • Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from the full-year loading of the 2010 new plant start-ups, along with several investments due to come onstream in 2011. • In Electronics, the Company projects silicon growth of 5%–10% and slow, steady growth of the business with the newer photovoltaic (PV) and light-emitting diode (LED) businesses growing at higher rates. In the integrated circuit business, the Company is well positioned with the industry leaders that are starting up new fabrication plants and expanding capacity. The electronics equipment business should also grow in 2011 due to anticipated continued electronics industry capital spending. Growth is expected in Performance Materials as the Company leverages low cost production facilities in Asia. Additionally, Performance Materials continues to benefit from new product, market and application successes. • Equipment and Energy results are expected to be comparable to 2010 levels. Two to three liquefied natural gas (LNG) orders are expected to be signed in 2011.

Additionally, 2008 results included favorable adjustments made to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. Selling and Administrative Expense (S&A) 2010 vs. 2009 S&A expense of $956.9 increased $13.5, or 1%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by improved productivity and the impact of the global cost reduction plan. S&A as a percent of sales decreased to 10.6% from 11.4%. 2009 vs. 2008 S&A expense of $943.4 decreased $147.0, or 13%. Underlying costs decreased 8%, primarily due to improved productivity as well as the impact of the global cost reduction plan, lower incentive compensation costs, and lower discretionary spending. This decrease was partially offset by inflation and higher bad debt expense. Favorable currency impacts, primarily the strengthening of the dollar against the Euro and Pound Sterling, decreased S&A by 6%. The acquisition of CryoService Limited in the third quarter of 2008 increased S&A by 1%. S&A as a percent of sales, increased to 11.4% from 10.5%, due principally to the impact of lower energy and raw material cost pass-through on sales. 21 Table of Contents 2011 Outlook S&A expense will increase in 2011 due to additional costs to support volume growth and the impacts of cost inflation. These increases will be partially offset by ongoing productivity initiatives. Research and Development (R&D) 2010 vs. 2009 R&D expense of $114.7 decreased 1%, or $1.6, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. R&D as a percent of sales decreased to 1.3% from 1.4%. 2009 vs. 2008 R&D expense of $116.3 decreased $14.4, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. R&D as a percent of sales increased to 1.4% from 1.3%. 2011 Outlook R&D expense is expected to be moderately higher in 2011. Global Cost Reduction Plan The 2009 results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after-tax, or $.94 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company announced the global cost reduction plan, designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The 2009 first-quarter results included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per share). In the third quarter 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, the Company committed to additional actions associated with its global cost reduction plan that resulted in a charge of $124.0 ($84.2 after-tax, or $.39 per share). The total 2009 charge included $210.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension-related costs, associated with the elimination of approximately 2,550 positions from the Company’s global workforce. The remainder of this charge, $88.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. During 2010, the Company revised its estimate of the costs associated with the 2009 global cost reduction plan. The unfavorable impact of additional severance and other benefits was primarily offset by favorable variances related to completed business exits and asset management actions. These adjustments to the charge were excluded from segment operating profit and did not have a material impact on any individual segment. As of 30 September 2010, the planned actions associated with the global cost reduction plan were substantially completed, with the exception of certain benefit payments associated with a small number of position eliminations. In addition, as part of the asset management actions included in the plan, the Company anticipates completing the sale of a facility by the end of calendar year 2010. Refer to Note 5, Global Cost Reduction Plan, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this charge. Cost savings of approximately $155 were achieved through 2010. Beyond 2010, the Company expects annualized, ongoing savings of approximately $180, of which the majority is related to personnel costs. Acquisition-Related Costs In 2010, $96.0 ($60.1 after-tax, or $.28 per share) in expense was recognized related to the Airgas transaction and is included within acquisition-related costs on the consolidated income statement. Refer to Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for details of these costs. Customer Bankruptcy and Asset Actions On 6 January 2009, a customer of the Company who principally receives product from the Tonnage Gases segment began operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, the Company recognized a $22.2 ($13.9 after- tax, or $.07 per share) charge primarily for the write-off of certain receivables during the third quarter of 2009. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment’s results. In April 2010, the customer emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. The Company received a final settlement in the amount of $22.4, of which $16.0 was applied against the remaining outstanding receivables. Income of $6.4 ($4.0 after-tax, or $.02 per share) was recognized for the recovery of certain receivables that had been previously written off. This amount was recorded as a gain and is reflected within customer bankruptcy on the consolidated income statement. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $9.9 ($7.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) for other asset actions which consisted of the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. This charge was reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated income statement. The 2009 customer bankruptcy charge combined with this asset write-down resulted in a total charge of $32.1 ($21.0 after-tax, or $.10 per share). 22 Table of Contents Pension Settlement The Company’s U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the participant’s retirement date. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. The Company recognized $11.5, $10.7, and $30.3 of settlement charges in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other Income, Net Items recorded to other income arise from transactions and events not directly related to the principal income earning activities of the Company. The detail of other income is presented in Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2010 vs. 2009 Other income of $38.7 increased $15.7, primarily due to a net gain on the sale of assets and favorable foreign exchange. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2009 vs. 2008 Other income of $23.0 decreased by $2.8. Other income declined due to losses from asset sales in 2009 and unfavorable foreign exchange. Other income in 2008 included a loss related to fire damage at a production facility. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 Interest incurred $136.2 $143.8 $184.1 Less: Capitalized interest 14.3 21.9 22.1 Interest Expense $121.9 $121.9 $162.0 2010 vs. 2009 Interest incurred decreased $7.6. The decrease was driven by lower average interest rates on variable rate debt, partially offset by a higher average debt balance and the impact of a weaker dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest. The change in capitalized interest is driven by a decrease in project spending which qualified for capitalization. 2009 vs. 2008 Interest incurred decreased by $40.3. This decrease was primarily driven by lower average interest rates on variable rate debt. The impact of a stronger dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest was offset by a higher average debt balance. Capitalized interest was comparable to 2008 due to slightly higher project levels offset by lower average interest rates. 2011 Outlook The Company expects interest incurred to be modestly higher. This increase is expected to result from a higher average debt balance, higher fees on the Company’s committed credit facility, and slightly higher interest rates on variable rate debt. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2010 vs. 2009 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.4% and 22.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 25.2% and 25.3% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 2009 vs. 2008 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 22.1% and 24.7% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 25.3% and 24.9% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher in 2009 due to lower tax credits and adjustments. 23 Table of Contents 2011 Outlook The Company expects the effective tax rate in 2011 to be approximately 25.0% to 26.0%. Discontinued Operations The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 6, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. U.S. Healthcare In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of U.S. Healthcare business. In the first half of 2009, based on additional facts, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share), reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the business. Also, tax benefits of $25.5, or $.12 per share, were recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit associated with the total impairment charges recorded. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company sold more than half of its remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $38.1. The Company recognized an after-tax gain of $.3 resulting from the sales combined with adjustments to net realizable value of the remaining businesses. During the fourth quarter of 2009, through a series of transactions, the Company sold its remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $12.1. A net after-tax loss of $.7 was recognized.

Cash flow from operations provided funding for the Company’s capital spending and dividend payments. The Company retained consistent access to commercial paper markets throughout the year. The Company’s cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $1,522.4 $1,329.4 $1,658.8 Investing activities (1,056.5 ) (1,040.4 ) (919.8 ) Financing activities (579.7 ) 95.0 (677.7 ) Operating Activities 2010 vs. 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $193.0, or 15%. The increase resulted from higher net income of $397.8 combined with the favorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $191.2, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $396.0. Noncash adjustments include depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, certain acquisition-related costs and share-based compensation cost. These adjustments also include changes in operating assets, such as noncurrent capital lease receivables, and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt or disbursement of cash and their recognition in earnings. Favorable noncash adjustments to net income in 2010 primarily included the following: • An increase in deferred income taxes of $148.5 due to pension funding and the utilization of foreign tax credits. • Expense of $84.0 for the amortization of financing costs associated with the Airgas tender offer. • A decrease in noncurrent capital lease receivables of $101.1. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by the impact of 2009 noncash impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business. Changes in working capital increased cash used (negative cash flow variance) by $396.0 and included: • A $301.5 negative cash flow variance due to higher trade receivables. The current year reflected a negative cash flow of $142.5 caused by rising sales, while the prior year reflected a positive cash flow of $159.0 resulting from a significant drop in sales. • A $94.6 negative cash flow variance from inventories and contracts in progress primarily due to increased spending for inventory and projects to support higher business activity. 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $329.4, or 20%. The decrease resulted from the reduction in net income of $278.4 combined with the unfavorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $143.4, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of $92.4. Net income in 2009 included noncash impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, U.S. Healthcare noncash impairment charges totaling $314.8 were partially offset by gains of $105.9 on the sale of discontinued operations. Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses are reflected as an investing activity. Changes in working capital decreased cash used (positive cash flow variance) by $92.4 and included: • A $256.4 positive cash flow variance due to lower trade receivables as a result of lower sales. • A $108.7 positive cash flow variance from other receivables due primarily to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 2008 related to the U.S. Healthcare impairment charge. The recognition of this asset represented a use of cash in 2008. • A $319.0 negative cash flow variance due to a higher use of cash for payables and accrued liabilities. This variance was due to a lower level of activity and the timing of payments. 30 Table of Contents Investing Activities 2010 vs. 2009 Cash used for investing increased $16.1, primarily due to: • Capital expenditures for plant and equipment decreased by $148.2, consistent with the Company’s capital spending plan. • The Company purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6 prior to a tender offer as discussed in Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements. • Changes in restricted cash, due to lower project spending, resulted in a reduced source of cash of $53.4. The proceeds from the issuance of certain Industrial Revenue Bonds must be held in escrow until related project spending occurs and are classified as noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet. • The prior year included proceeds of $51.0 from the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. 2009 vs. 2008 Cash used for investing increased $120.6, primarily from lower proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $372.0, partially offset by changes in restricted cash of $270.6. • During 2009, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. Healthcare business, which generated proceeds of $51.0. In 2008, proceeds of $423.0 included the sales of the Polymer Emulsions and HPPC businesses. • Decreases in the restricted cash balances, caused by project spending exceeding new bond proceeds, resulted in a source of cash of $87.0 in 2009. Activity in 2008 resulted in a use of cash of $183.6. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2010 2009 2008 Additions to plant and equipment $1,030.9 $1,179.1 $1,085.1 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 37.2 32.7 72.0 Short-term borrowings associated with SAGA acquisition (A) 60.9 — — Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 4.8 24.5 2.2 Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $1,133.8 $1,236.3 $1,159.3 Capital lease expenditures (B) 122.6 238.6 195.7 Noncurrent liability related to purchase of shares from noncontrollinginterests (B) 42.0 — — Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $1,298.4 $1,474.9 $1,355.0 (A) Noncash transaction. (B) The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. • Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. • Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2010 totaled $1,133.8, compared to $1,236.3 in 2009, resulting in a reduction of $102.5. Additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses during both 2010 and 2009. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2010 totaled $1,298.4, compared to $1,474.9 in 2009. Capital lease expenditures of $122.6 decreased by $116.0, reflecting lower project spending. In 2009, capital lease expenditures of $238.6 increased $42.9 from 2008, reflecting higher project spending, primarily in North America Tonnage Gases. 2011 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2011 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,400 and $1,500, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,500 and $1,700. The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases which are expected to be between $100 and $200. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with 31 Table of Contents approximately $1,000 associated with new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, the Company intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. Financing Activities 2010 vs. 2009 Cash used by financing activities increased $674.7, primarily due to: • A decrease in long-term proceeds of $384.3. The prior year included proceeds of $400.0 from the issuance of a fixed-rate 4.375% 10-year senior note. • An increase in payments on long-term debt of $353.5, resulting primarily from the repayment of a €250 Eurobond ($306.8). 2009 vs. 2008 Cash provided by financing activities increased $772.7, primarily as a result of share repurchases of $793.4 in 2008. In 2009, the Company did not purchase any of its outstanding shares. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2010 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2010, total debt outstanding was $4.1 billion compared to $4.5 billion, and cash and cash items were $.4 billion compared to $.5 billion. Total debt at 30 September 2010 and 2009, expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt and total equity, was 42.0% and 47.7%, respectively. Long-term debt proceeds of $226.2 included $85.0 from the issuance of Industrial Revenue Bonds. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding common stock of Airgas as further discussed in Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with this tender offer, the Company has secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. Borrowings under this credit facility will be available beginning on the date of the consummation of the tender offer, which must occur no later than 4 February 2011. All borrowings under this credit facility will mature on the date that is one year from the consummation of the tender offer. The credit facility agreement contains one financial covenant, a maximum leverage ratio, and other affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on liens and certain subsidiary indebtedness. It also requires mandatory commitment reduction/prepayment for certain capital market transactions and asset dispositions. Fees incurred to secure this credit facility have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the arrangement. The Company has obtained the commitment of a number of commercial banks to lend money at market rates whenever needed. At 30 September 2009, the Company’s total multicurrency committed credit facility amounted to $1,450. On 8 July 2010, the Company replaced this facility with a new $2,000 multicurrency committed credit facility maturing on 8 July 2013. Facility fees were modified to reflect current market rates. The Company has one financial covenant associated with this new credit facility. The covenant indicates that the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) shall not exceed 3.0. This credit facility provides a source of liquidity and is used to support the issuance of commercial paper. No borrowings were outstanding under this commitment at the end of 2010. Additional commitments totaling $518.7 are maintained by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, of which $345.2 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2010. In 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company’s outstanding common stock. During 2010, the Company did not purchase any shares under this authorization. At 30 September 2010, $649.2 in share repurchase authorization remained. 2011 Outlook Exclusive of the potential Airgas transaction described above, the Company projects a limited need to access the long-term debt markets in 2011 due to its projected operating cash flows, modest debt maturities and available cash balance at the end of 2010. Should the Airgas transaction occur, the Company expects to fund this acquisition primarily with new debt financing. The Company expects that it will continue to be in compliance with all of its financial covenants. Also, the Company anticipates that it will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. 32 Table of Contents Dividends On 18 March 2010, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.45 per share to $.49 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes these obligations of the Company as of 30 September 2010: Payments Due By Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $3,842 $182 $453 $335 $488 $444 $1,940 Contractual interest 698 122 109 93 72 58 244 Capital leases 11 2 2 2 1 1 3 Operating leases 190 50 38 28 18 13 43 Pension obligations 1,042 247 104 136 90 92 373 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,466 482 100 103 112 118 551 Other liabilities 103 61 42 — — — — Total Contractual Obligations $7,352 $1,146 $848 $697 $781 $726 $3,154 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest the Company is contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. The Company had $1,240 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2010, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2010. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Most of the Company’s long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, the Company does not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The above unconditional purchase obligations include other product supply commitments and also electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $330 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2011. 33 Table of Contents The Company also purchases materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. In total, purchases by the Company approximate $6.3 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above. Other Liabilities Other liabilities includes the obligation to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of the French SAGA group (SAGA) for a fixed price of €44.8, or approximately $61, and the obligation to purchase 25% of the remaining shares of CryoService Limited (CSL) for $42.0. In the second quarter of 2010, the Company entered into agreements that will enable it to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of SAGA. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company purchased 51.47% of the shares in March 2010. The remaining shares are expected to be purchased by the end of calendar year 2010 for a fixed price of €44.8, or approximately $61, under a put and call option structure. At 30 September 2010, this structure was accounted for as a financing of the purchase of the remaining shares and reported within short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 4, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Additionally, in June 2010, the Company entered into agreements obligating it to purchase 25% of the remaining shares of CSL. The agreements require the consideration, which is based on a multiple of earnings formula, to be remitted in January 2012. At 30 September 2010, the liability amounted to $42.0 and has been reported in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 20, Noncontrolling Interests, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2010 were $335.1. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2010 were $233.7. These tax liabilities were not included in the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year. PENSION BENEFITS The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans—the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. The move to defined contribution plans has not had a material impact on retirement program cost levels or funding. Over the long run, however, the defined contribution plans are expected to reduce volatility of both expense and contributions. For 2010, the fair market value of pension plan assets for the Company’s defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $2,711.6 from $2,251.0 in 2009. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $3,753.6 and $3,386.0 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the obligation was due principally to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to measure future benefit obligations to 5.0% from 5.6%. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on the Company’s postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2010 2009 2008 Pension expense $109.0 $110.0 $127.0 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 14.8 43.8 31.5 Weighted average discount rate 5.6 % 7.1 % 6.1 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 8.2 % 8.3 % 8.8 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 4.1 % 4.3 % 4.2 % 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in pension expense, net of special items, was primarily attributable to the 150 basis point decrease in the weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets due to higher contributions. Expense in 2010 included $14.8 of special termination and settlement charges, of which $2.8 was related to the global cost reduction plan. 34 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in pension expense was primarily attributable to the 100 basis point increase in the weighted average discount rate. Expense in 2009 included $43.8 of special termination, settlement, and curtailment charges, of which $32.3 was related to the global cost reduction plan. 2011 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $122 in 2011, an increase of $27.8 from 2010, net of special terminations and settlements. In 2011, pension expense will include approximately $94 for amortization of actuarial losses versus $66.8 in 2010. Actuarial losses of $294.8 were incurred in 2010, resulting primarily from lower discount rates. Actuarial gains/losses, in excess of certain thresholds, are amortized into pension expense over the average remaining service lives of the employees to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2011. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans. With respect to funded plans, the Company’s funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, the Company makes contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing its capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. The Company analyzes the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2010 and 2009, the Company’s cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans were $406.6 and $184.8, respectively. The majority of the cash contributions were voluntary. Cash contributions to defined benefit plans, including benefit payments for unfunded plans, are estimated to be approximately $247 in 2011. Of this amount, $200 was contributed in October 2010. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 33 for a projection of future contributions. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, the Company is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. The Company’s accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $31.6, $52.5, and $49.9 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. The 2009 amount included a charge of $16.0 for the Paulsboro site. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge. The 2008 amount included revised cost estimates for several existing sites. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, the Company estimates that in both 2010 and 2009, it spent approximately $6 on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $6 in both 2011 and 2012. The Company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $87 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $101. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2010 and 2009 included an accrual of $87.0 and $95.0, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and the Paulsboro, New Jersey facilities is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. 35 Table of Contents Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of the Company’s operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in California and Ontario. In the U.S., regional initiatives have been implemented that will regulate GHG emissions from fossil fuel-driven power plants, and some federal legislative proposals also focus on such power plants. As a large consumer of electric power, the Company could be impacted by increased costs that may arise from such regulatory controls. In addition, federal legislation has been introduced in the U.S. that would regulate GHG emissions from the Company’s hydrogen facilities and other operations, such as production of fluorinated gases manufactured by the Company. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken preliminary actions towards regulating GHG emissions. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. The Company may incur costs related to GHG emissions from its hydrogen facilities and other operations such as fluorinated gases production. The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through its contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from Company facilities could impact the Company’s growth by increasing its operating costs or reducing demand for certain of its products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for the Company. The Company continues to develop technologies to help its facilities and its customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. The Company is also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and the Company’s carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of the Company’s main products, and the Company’s proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company is not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. The Company does not have any derivative instruments indexed to its own stock. The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company’s principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. The Company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties. INFLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years’ inflation. While the U.S. inflation rate has been modest for several years, the Company operates in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing the Company’s plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes the Company’s major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the Company’s accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires 36 Table of Contents management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. The Company’s management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with its audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2010 totaled $7,051.3, and depreciation expense totaled $837.7 during 2010. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. The Company has numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease LifeBy 1 Year Increase LifeBy 1 Year Merchant Gases $19 $(14 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $15 $(12 ) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. There were no such events or changes in circumstances that occurred during the reporting periods. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be 37 Table of Contents impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $60.2, was $974.8 as of 30 September 2010. The majority of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company performs an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires the Company to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. The Company has designated its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, the Company has four business segments and fifteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. The Company determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The Company primarily uses an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows, to determine fair value of a reporting unit. The Company’s valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by the Company’s reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in the Company’s income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in the Company’s operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted-average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. Intangible Assets Intangible assets at 30 September 2010 totaled $285.7 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents, and technology. The Company has no acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $912.8 at 30 September 2010. The majority of the Company’s investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized 38 Table of Contents financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2010, accrued income taxes and deferred tax liabilities amounted to $73.6 and $335.1, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2010 were $233.7. Current and noncurrent deferred tax assets equaled $209.6 at 30 September 2010. Income tax expense was $339.5 for the year ended 30 September 2010. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in the Company’s effective tax rate would have decreased/increased net income by approximately $14. Pension Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. The Company determines assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. The Company believes the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. For the U.S. plans, the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched with an interest rate curve applicable to the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate. In making this 39 Table of Contents determination, the Company considers the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve, the general movement of interest rates, and the changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $23 per year. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on an estimated weighted average of long-term returns of major asset classes. In determining asset class returns, the Company takes into account long-term returns of major asset classes, historical performance of plan assets, and related value of active management, as well as the current interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined by an asset/liability study that takes into account plan demographics, asset returns, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $14 per year. The Company uses a market-related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets. This method recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. The Company determines this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $12 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business the Company encounters contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the Company. The Company accrues a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which the Company’s accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or the Company’s proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on the Company’s net income in the period in which it is recorded. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the Company’s implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. 40 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, plans, estimates and expectations regarding future operations, financial performance, costs and capital expenditures, projects, and applications and technologies. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date this Report is filed regarding important risk factors. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, the Company’s acquisition of Airgas Inc. pursuant to the Company’s pending tender offer; slowing of global economic recovery; renewed deterioration in economic and business conditions; weakening demand for the Company’s products; future financial and operating performance of major customers and industries served by the Company; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific product or customer events; the success of commercial negotiations; the impact of competitive products and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory activities; successful development and market acceptance of new products and applications; the ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel in all regions of the world where the Company operates; consequences of acts of war or terrorism; the effects of a natural disaster; the success of cost reduction and productivity programs; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures, including achieving anticipated acquisition synergies; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the continued availability of capital funding sources in all of the Company’s foreign operations; the impact of environmental, healthcare, tax or other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact of new or changed financial accounting guidance; the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized; and other risk factors described in Section 1A. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company’s earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is the Company’s policy to minimize its cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. The Company mitigates adverse energy price impacts through its cost pass-through contracts with customers, as well as price increases. The Company has also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oil-based feedstocks. There were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at 30 September 2010. The Company addresses these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The Company’s derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange-forward contracts, foreign exchange-option contracts, and commodity swaps. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position. The net financial instrument position does not include available-for-sale securities of $103.6 at 30 September 2010 and $19.4 at 30 September 2009 as disclosed in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. The available-for-sale securities in 2010 primarily included the investment in Airgas stock of $102.5. At 30 September 2010 and 2009, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $4,086 and $4,510, respectively. The decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to a reduction in long-term debt and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the translation of foreign currency long-term debt. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the Company’s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. The range of changes chosen reflects the Company’s view of changes that are 41 Table of Contents reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by the Company using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of 30 September 2010 primarily comprised debt denominated in Euros (42%) and U.S. dollars (44%), including the effect of currency swaps. This debt portfolio is composed of 48% fixed-rate debt and 52% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of the Company’s debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position. The sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of the Company’s debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2010, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $87 and $92 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively. A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $95 and $92 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively. Based on the variable-rate debt included in the Company’s debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional $22 and $20 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively. A 100 basis point decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $22 and $20 per year at 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2010 and 2009, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $345 and $369 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2010 and 2009, respectively. The primary currencies for which the Company has exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the U.S. dollar versus the Pound Sterling. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where the Company does business, thereby reducing its net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts are also used to hedge the Company’s firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows, along with foreign exchange-option contracts. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal (or more favorable in the case of purchased foreign exchange-option contracts) to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. 42 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:31.234302

All comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as noted. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for share data, unless otherwise indicated. Captions such as income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products, net income attributable to Air Products, and diluted earnings per share attributable to Air Products are simply referred to as “income from continuing operations,” “net income,” and “diluted earnings per share” throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise stated. The discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures exclude the net loss on Airgas transaction in 2011 and 2010. For 2009, the non-GAAP measures exclude the global cost reduction plan charge, costs related to customer bankruptcy and asset actions, and third quarter 2009 pension settlement costs. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis. The reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures is presented on pages 27-28. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries serves energy, electronics, chemicals, steel, and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, equipment, and services. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 40 countries, we have sales of $10.1 billion, assets of $14.3 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 18,900 employees. We organize our operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. 2011 IN SUMMARY In 2011, we had strong increases in sales and earnings in the first half of the year with a slowing in the second half due to product supply and cost issues and declining economic growth. In the first two quarters of 2011, underlying sales increased 11% and 12%, respectively due to strong volume growth. In the third and fourth quarters of 2011, our underlying sales increased 7% and 6%, respectively. Overall for 2011, sales increased 12%, principally due to volume increases of 9%. Volumes increased in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. Also, we achieved significant growth in Asia in the Merchant Gases segment. Operating income increased due primarily to improved performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. Operating margin increased modestly from last year, as operating leverage was partially offset by a number of product supply and cost issues in the last nine months of the year. 18 Table of Contents We withdrew our tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Airgas, terminated the associated credit facility, and sold previously purchased Airgas stock. Highlights for 2011 • Sales of $10,082.0 increased 12%, or $1,056.0, driven by strong volume increases across the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage Gases and Merchant Gases segments. • Operating income of $1,622.2 increased 17%, or $233.2. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,670.7 increased 13%, or $185.7, primarily due to improved performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. • Income from continuing operations of $1,215.3 increased 18%, or $186.2, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.59 increased 18%, or $.85. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,246.9 increased 14%, or $157.7, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.73 increased 14%, or $.71. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented below. • Capital spending of $1,408.3 increased 24%. On a non-GAAP basis, capital spending of $1,581.8 increased 22%, primarily for the construction of new plants under contract with customers. • Operating cash flow increased 15%, a significant improvement from last year. • We purchased 7.4 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of $649.2, which completed our prior $1,000 share repurchase program. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1,000 share repurchase program. • We increased our quarterly dividend from $.49 to $.58 per share. This represents the 29th consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to our 2012 Outlook discussions provided on page 20 in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis that follows.

Management believes global economic growth in the regions we operate in could range from 2%–5% in 2012. We expect that the U.S. will have positive growth between 1%–5%. Europe should range between a negative 2% to a positive 1%. We believe Asia will continue as the strongest region, growing at 4%–9%. Regardless of global economic conditions, we expect new plant onstreams to increase earnings in 2012. Loading existing assets would also benefit earnings, however, this factor will be most influenced by the economy. We also expect earnings improvement from our productivity efforts and cost controls in discretionary spending, new programs, and staffing. These gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense next year, as a result of a decline in the discount rates and lower asset returns, lower Equipment and Energy results, and a higher tax rate in 2012. The 2012 tax rate is expected to be approximately 26% excluding the impact of the completion of the tax examination and any changes in uncertain tax positions related to the two Spanish tax matters, as described in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook by Segment • In Merchant Gases, we expect volume growth in the U.S. from new applications and the expansion of Microbulk (small bulk) offerings. As we continue to expand our capacity in Asia, manufacturing growth along with new applications should lead to stronger volumes. In Europe, we will continue to seek higher pricing to offset higher energy costs and will also take actions to reduce operating costs. • Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from the full-year loading of our 2011 new plant start-ups, along with several investments due to come onstream in 2012. • In Electronics, we expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half, primarily due to new plant start-ups and increased demand. The electronics equipment business is expected to slow in 2012 due to a forecasted decline in electronics industry capital spending. For Performance Materials, we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter and that volumes will remain soft in the first half of the year. However, if economic conditions improve as expected in the second half of the year, volume growth should return, as we benefit from our low cost production facilities and new product, market and application successes. • Equipment and Energy results are expected to decline due to lower LNG activity.

Underlying business increased 10%, with volumes up 9% and price up 1%. Volumes grew primarily from strong performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases segment, and growth in Asia in the Merchant Gases segment. Currency favorably impacted sales 2%. 20 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Sales of $9,026.0 increased 9%, or $769.8. Underlying business increased 8%, driven by volume increases in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments, as the economic environment improved. These results were driven by a significant recovery in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment and new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases segment. Operating Income 2011 vs. 2010 Operating income of $1,622.2 increased 17%, or $233.2. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,670.7 increased 13%, or $185.7. Underlying business increased $161, primarily from higher volumes in all segments, partially offset by lower recovery of raw material costs in pricing and higher operating costs. Favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts increased operating income by $25. On a GAAP basis, operating income in the current year includes a $48.5 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. The prior year included a $96.0 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. 2010 vs. 2009 Operating income of $1,389.0 increased 64%, or $542.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,485.0 increased 25%, or $300.4. Underlying business increased $275, primarily from higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments and lower costs, partially offset by reduced pricing. Favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts increased operating income by $25. Equity Affiliates’ Income 2011 vs. 2010 Income from equity affiliates of $154.3 increased $27.4, or 22%. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes and price, and favorable currency and foreign exchange. 2010 vs. 2009 Income from equity affiliates of $126.9 increased $14.7, or 13%, primarily due to higher volumes. Selling and Administrative Expense (S&A) 2011 vs. 2010 S&A expense of $1,014.4 increased $57.5, or 6%, primarily due to unfavorable currency, inflation, and higher pension expense. S&A as a percent of sales decreased to 10.1% from 10.6%. 2010 vs. 2009 S&A expense of $956.9 increased $13.5, or 1%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by improved productivity and the impact of the global cost reduction plan. S&A as a percent of sales decreased to 10.6% from 11.4%. Research and Development (R&D) 2011 vs. 2010 R&D expense of $118.8 increased 4%, or $4.1, primarily due to increased spending in the Energy business. R&D as a percent of sales decreased to 1.2% from 1.3%. 2010 vs. 2009 R&D expense of $114.7 decreased 1%, or $1.6, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. R&D as a percent of sales decreased to 1.3% from 1.4%. Global Cost Reduction Plan The 2009 results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after-tax, or $.94 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. In the first quarter of 2009, we announced the global cost reduction plan, designed to lower our cost structure and better align our businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The 2009 first-quarter results included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per share). In the third quarter of 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, we committed to additional actions associated with our global cost reduction plan that resulted in a charge of $124.0 ($84.2 after-tax, or $.39 per share). The total 2009 charge included $210.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension-related costs, associated with the elimination of approximately 2,550 positions from our global workforce. The remainder of this charge, $88.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. 21 Table of Contents During 2010, we revised our estimate of the costs associated with the 2009 global cost reduction plan. The unfavorable impact of additional severance and other benefits was primarily offset by favorable variances related to completed business exits and asset management actions. These adjustments to the charge were excluded from segment operating profit and did not have a material impact on any individual segment. As of 30 September 2011, the planned actions associated with the global cost reduction plan were completed. Refer to Note 5, Global Cost Reduction Plan, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this charge. Net Loss on Airgas Transaction As discussed in Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements, we withdrew our tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Airgas on 15 February 2011. In connection with the tender offer, we had secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. This credit facility was also terminated. Prior to the tender offer, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for a total cost of $69.6. This amount was recorded as an available-for-sale investment within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. On 16 February 2011, we sold the 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for total proceeds of $94.7 and recognized a gain of $25.1 ($15.9 after-tax, or $.07 per share). For the year ended 30 September 2011, $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share) in net loss was recognized related to this transaction. This amount is reflected separately on the consolidated income statement as “Net loss on Airgas transaction” and includes amortization of the fees related to the term loan credit facility, the gain on the sale of Airgas stock, and other acquisition-related costs. For the year ended 30 September 2010, $96.0 ($60.1 after-tax, or $.28 per share) in expense was recognized in relation to this transaction. Refer to Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements. Customer Bankruptcy and Asset Actions On 6 January 2009, one of our customers, who principally receives product from the Tonnage Gases segment, began operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, we recognized a $22.2 ($13.9 after- tax, or $.07 per share) charge, primarily for the write-off of certain receivables during the third quarter of 2009. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment’s results. In April 2010, the customer emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. We received a final settlement in the amount of $22.4, of which $16.0 was applied against the remaining outstanding receivables. Income of $6.4 ($4.0 after-tax, or $.02 per share) was recognized for the recovery of certain receivables that had been previously written off. This amount was recorded as a gain and is reflected within customer bankruptcy on the consolidated income statement. In the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a charge of $9.9 ($7.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) for other asset actions which consisted of the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. This charge was reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated income statement. The 2009 customer bankruptcy charge combined with this asset write-down resulted in a total charge of $32.1 ($21.0 after-tax, or $.10 per share). Pension Settlement Our U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the participant’s retirement date. We recognize pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. We recognized $11.5 and $10.7 of settlement charges in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other Income, Net Items recorded to other income arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income is presented in Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2011 vs. 2010 Other income of $37.2 decreased $1.5, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange, offset mainly by reimbursements from government grants for expenses. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 22 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Other income of $38.7 increased $15.7, primarily due to a net gain on the sale of assets and favorable foreign exchange. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 Interest incurred $138.2 $136.2 $143.8 Less: Capitalized interest 22.7 14.3 21.9 Interest Expense $115.5 $121.9 $121.9 2011 vs. 2010 Interest incurred increased $2.0. The increase was driven by the impact of a weaker dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest, partially offset by a lower average debt balance. The change in capitalized interest is driven by an increase in project spending which qualified for capitalization. 2010 vs. 2009 Interest incurred decreased $7.6. The decrease was driven by lower average interest rates on variable rate debt, partially offset by a higher average debt balance and the impact of a weaker dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest. The change in capitalized interest is driven by a decrease in project spending which qualified for capitalization. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2011 vs. 2010 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.6% and 24.4% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.9% and 25.2% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. 2010 vs. 2009 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.4% and 22.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 25.2% and 25.3% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Discontinued Operations In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. The U.S. Healthcare business was accounted for as a discontinued operation with its results of operations removed from the results of continuing operations. In the first half of 2009, based on additional facts, we recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share), reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the business. Also, tax benefits of $25.5, or $.12 per share, were recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit associated with the total impairment charges recorded. During the third quarter of 2009, we sold more than half of our remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $38.1. We recognized an after-tax gain of $.3 resulting from the sales combined with adjustments to net realizable value of the remaining businesses. During the fourth quarter of 2009, through a series of transactions, we sold our remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $12.1. A net after-tax loss of $.7 was recognized. These transactions completed the disposal of the U.S. Healthcare business. The U.S. Healthcare business generated sales of $125.2 and a loss from operations, net of tax, of $3.4 in 2009. Refer to Note 6, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. During the third quarter of 2011, a tax benefit of $8.9, or $.04 per share, was recognized related to the U.S. Healthcare business resulting from the completion of an audit of tax years 2007 and 2008 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the audit settlement. 23 Table of Contents Net Income 2011 vs. 2010 Net income was $1,224.2 compared to $1,029.1, and diluted earnings per share was $5.63 compared to $4.74.

Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $1,753.2 $1,522.4 $1,329.4 Investing activities (1,212.2 ) (1,056.5 ) (1,040.4 ) Financing activities (484.5 ) (579.7 ) 95.0 Operating Activities 2011 vs. 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $230.8, or 15%. The increase resulted from higher net income of $195.1 combined with the favorable impact of changes in working capital of $238.1, partially offset by unfavorable adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities of $202.4. Changes in working capital increased cash provided by $238.1 and primarily included: • A $261.2 positive cash flow variance from payables and accrued liabilities, primarily due to lower pension contributions in the current year of $165.6 and payments related to the global cost reduction program of $103.0 in the prior year. • A $39.0 positive cash flow variance from trade receivables as the current year reflected a negative cash flow of $103.5 while the prior year reflected a negative cash flow of $142.5. Faster collections of receivables in the current year partially offset the increase in sales. • A $62.1 net negative cash flow variance in several other working capital accounts, primarily from changes in other receivables and accrued income taxes. 28 Table of Contents Adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities include depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, certain acquisition-related costs and share-based compensation cost. These adjustments also include changes in operating assets, such as noncurrent capital lease receivables and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt or disbursement of cash and their recognition in earnings. Unfavorable adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities in 2011 primarily included the following: • An increase in noncurrent capital lease receivables of $186.9, primarily related to a new large contract in China that is accounted for as a capital lease. • Higher payments of Airgas acquisition-related costs of $144.2 as payments in the current year were $156.2 compared to $12.0 in the prior year. These unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of $89.5 due to tax benefits related to a U.S. audit settlement, the Airgas transaction, and bonus depreciation. 2010 vs. 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $193.0, or 15%. The increase resulted from higher net income of $397.8 combined with the favorable impact of adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities of $191.2, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $396.0. Favorable adjustments to income to reconcile to cash provided by operating activities in 2010 primarily included the following: • An increase in deferred income taxes of $148.5 due to pension funding and the utilization of foreign tax credits. • Expense of $84.0 for the amortization of financing costs associated with the Airgas tender offer. • A decrease in noncurrent capital lease receivables of $101.1. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by the impact of 2009 impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business. Changes in working capital increased cash used by $396.0 and included: • A $301.5 negative cash flow variance due to higher trade receivables. The current year reflected a negative cash flow of $142.5 caused by rising sales, while the prior year reflected a positive cash flow of $159.0 resulting from a significant drop in sales. • A $94.6 negative cash flow variance from inventories and contracts in progress primarily due to increased spending for inventory and projects to support higher business activity. Investing Activities 2011 vs. 2010 Cash used for investing increased $155.7, primarily due to: • Capital expenditures for plant and equipment increased by $320.8. • Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates increased by $41.0, primarily due to an additional investment in an Asian equity affiliate. • A positive cash flow variance of $164.3 resulted from the current year proceeds of $94.7 received from the sale of approximately 1.5 million Airgas shares and the prior year purchase of these shares for $69.6. • A positive cash flow variance of $29.2 resulted from higher proceeds from the sale of assets and investments. 2010 vs. 2009 Cash used for investing increased $16.1, primarily due to: • Capital expenditures for plant and equipment decreased by $148.2, consistent with our capital spending plan. • We purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6. • Changes in restricted cash, due to lower project spending, resulted in a reduced source of cash of $53.4. The proceeds from the issuance of certain Industrial Revenue Bonds must be held in escrow until related project spending occurs and are classified as noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet. • The prior year included proceeds of $51.0 from the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. 29 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2011 2010 2009 Additions to plant and equipment $1,351.7 $1,030.9 $1,179.1 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 10.8 37.2 32.7 Short-term borrowings associated with SAGA acquisition (A) — 60.9 — Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 45.8 4.8 24.5 Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $1,408.3 $1,133.8 $1,236.3 Capital lease expenditures (B) 173.5 122.6 238.6 Noncurrent liability related to purchase of shares from noncontrolling interests (B) — 42.0 — Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $1,581.8 $1,298.4 $1,474.9 (A) Noncash transaction. (B) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure which our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2011 totaled $1,408.3, compared to $1,133.8 in 2010, resulting in an increase of $274.5. Additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses during both 2011 and 2010. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2011 totaled $1,581.8, compared to $1,298.4 in 2010. Capital lease expenditures of $173.5 increased by $50.9, reflecting higher project spending. 2012 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2012 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,600 and $1,800, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,900 and $2,200. The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases which are expected to be between $300 and $400. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with approximately $1,000 associated with new plants and pipelines. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. In September 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire 25% of the outstanding shares of Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG). The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary local closing conditions. The closing date is expected to occur in early 2012. AHG is a company of the privately-owned Abdullah Hashim Group, based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. AHG is the largest private industrial gases company in Saudi Arabia. It is comprised of three businesses, including industrial gases, equipment and consumables and refrigerants. The transaction will be recorded as an investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates in the Merchant Gases segment with the purchase price included in capital expenditures in the period it closes. Financing Activities 2011 vs. 2010 Cash used by financing activities decreased $95.2, primarily due to: • An increase in the net cash provided by commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $308.9, driven primarily by $338.4 of proceeds from commercial paper. • A decrease in payments on long-term debt of $249.3. Payments in the prior year primarily included a €250 million Eurobond ($306.8) and a $50.0 Medium-term note. Payments in 2011 primarily included $156.0 Medium-term notes. 30 Table of Contents • An increase in long-term debt proceeds of $183.6, due primarily to the issuance of a $350.0 senior fixed-rate 2.0% note in the current year. The prior year primarily included proceeds of $85.0 from the issuance of an Industrial Revenue Bond. • The above three items, all of which decreased cash used by financing activities, were largely offset by an increase in cash used of $649.2 due to the purchase of treasury stock in 2011. 2010 vs. 2009 Cash used by financing activities increased $674.7, primarily due to: • A decrease in long-term proceeds of $384.3. The prior year included proceeds of $400.0 from the issuance of a fixed-rate 4.375% 10-year senior note. • An increase in payments on long-term debt of $353.5, resulting primarily from the repayment of a €250 million Eurobond ($306.8). Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2011 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2011, total debt outstanding was $4,562.2 compared to $4,128.3 and Cash and cash items were $422.5 compared to $374.3. Total debt at 30 September 2011 and 2010, expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt and total equity, was 43.4% and 42.0%, respectively. Long-term debt proceeds of $409.8 included $350.0 from the issuance of a senior fixed-rate 2.0% note. Additionally, on 3 November 2011, we issued a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.0% note that matures 3 November 2021, the proceeds of which will be used for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We have obtained the commitment of a number of commercial banks to lend money at market rates whenever needed. Effective 31 March 2011, we increased our total multicurrency revolving facility, maturing in July 2013, by $170.0, to a total of $2,170.0. Effective 30 June 2011, this $2,170.0 facility was amended to extend the maturity date from 8 July 2013 to 30 June 2015, reduce facility fees to reflect current market rates and modify the financial covenant. Our only financial covenant changed from a maximum ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of no greater than 3.0 to a ratio of long-term debt to equity of no greater than 60%. There were no other material changes to the terms and conditions of the arrangement. This credit facility provides a source of liquidity and is used to support the issuance of commercial paper. No borrowings were outstanding under this commitment at 30 September 2011. Additional commitments totaling $474.2 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $419.1 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2011. We are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. In 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We repurchase shares pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, through repurchase agreements established with several brokers. During fiscal year 2011, we purchased 7.4 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of $649.2, which completed our 2007 $1,000 share repurchase program. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1,000 share repurchase program. At 30 September 2011, $1,000 in share repurchase authorization remains. 2012 Outlook Cash flow from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2012, primarily driven by debt maturities. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. Dividends On 17 March 2011, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.49 per share to $.58 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. 31 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2011: Payments Due By Period Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $4,000 $474 $334 $476 $479 $402 $1,835 Contractual interest 516 114 98 77 62 52 113 Capital leases 9 3 2 1 1 1 1 Operating leases 220 53 44 35 29 24 35 Pension obligations 942 40 75 197 199 86 345 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,675 649 121 119 117 122 547 Other liabilities 51 51 — — — — — Total Contractual Obligations $7,413 $1,384 $674 $905 $887 $687 $2,876 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $1,229 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2011, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2011. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 11, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. The 2012 amount represents the low end of an estimated range of $40 to $60. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Most of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. We also have one supply agreement that is not matched to a customer sales contract that has terms extending to ten years and the related commitment is at prices that are not in excess of current market prices. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $510 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2012. 32 Table of Contents We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. In total, we purchase approximately $7.4 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above. Other Liabilities In June 2010, we entered into agreements obligating us to purchase 25% of the remaining shares of CryoService Limited (CSL). The agreements require the consideration, which is based on a multiple of earnings formula, to be remitted in December 2011. At 30 September 2011, the liability amounted to $51.0 and has been reported in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 19, Noncontrolling Interests, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2011 were $570.1. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2011 were $126.4. These tax liabilities were not included in the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year. PENSION BENEFITS We and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans—the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. For 2011, the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $2,823.7 from $2,711.6 in 2010. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $3,765.8 and $3,753.6 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2011 2010 2009 Pension expense $114.1 $109.0 $110.0 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 1.3 14.8 43.8 Weighted average discount rate 5.0 % 5.6 % 7.1 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 8.0 % 8.2 % 8.3 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 4.0 % 4.1 % 4.3 % 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in pension expense, net of special items, was primarily attributable to the 60 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions in 2011. Expense in 2011 included $1.3 of special termination and settlement charges. 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in pension expense, net of special items, was primarily attributable to the 150 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions. Expense in 2010 included $14.8 of special termination and settlement charges, of which $2.8 was related to the global cost reduction plan. 2012 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $120 to $125 in 2012, an increase of $7 to $12 from 2011, net of special terminations and settlements. In 2012, pension expense will include approximately $91 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $94.8 in 2011. Net actuarial losses of $127.7 were incurred in 2011, resulting primarily from actual asset returns below expected returns, partially offset by actuarial gains experienced by the international plans, as a result of an increase in discount rates. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2012. 33 Table of Contents Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. We analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2011 and 2010, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $241.0 and $406.6, respectively. The majority of the cash contributions were voluntary. Cash contributions to defined benefit plans, including benefit payments for unfunded plans, are estimated to be approximately $40 to $60 in 2012. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 32 for a projection of future contributions. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, we are involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $34.0, $31.6, and $52.5 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. The 2009 amount included a charge of $16.0 for the Paulsboro site. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that in both 2011 and 2010, we spent approximately $6 and $6, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $6 and $6 in 2012 and 2013, respectively. We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $82 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $96. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2011 and 2010 included an accrual of $82.3 and $87.0, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and the Paulsboro, New Jersey locations is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada and South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. At the U.S. state level, California’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer is set to begin 1 January 2013. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms. 34 Table of Contents Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. We do not have any derivative instruments indexed to our own stock. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. We did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties. INFLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years’ inflation. While some inflationary pressures developed during the second half of fiscal year 2011, inflation in the U.S. has been modest for several years. In addition, we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates, with inflationary pressures that differ from those in the U.S. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2011 totaled $7,412.0, and depreciation expense totaled $851.0 during 2011. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. 35 Table of Contents We have numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Additionally, we have several customer supply contracts within the Energy and Equipment segment with contract terms that are primarily 5 to 10 years. The depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain re-deployable assets. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease LifeBy 1 Year Increase LifeBy 1 Year Merchant Gases $27 $(18 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $20 $(14 ) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. There were no such events or changes in circumstances that occurred during the reporting periods. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $62.6, was $955.0 as of 30 September 2011. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents We perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. We have designated our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, we have four business segments and fifteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. We determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. We primarily use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows, to determine fair value of a reporting unit. Our valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted-average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. Intangible Assets Intangible assets at 30 September 2011 totaled $260.7 and consisted primarily of customer relationships as well as purchased patents and technology. We have no intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,011.6 at 30 September 2011. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2011, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $65.5 and $347.7, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2011 were $126.4, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense was $408.4 for the year ended 30 September 2011. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. 37 Table of Contents Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would have decreased/increased net income by approximately $17. Pension Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. The timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate. This rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $27 per year. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns, and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $15 per year. We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets. This method recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. 38 Table of Contents The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $13 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including earnings guidance, projections and targets. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date this Report is filed regarding important risk factors. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, renewed deterioration in global economic and business conditions, including weakening demand for the Company’s products and inability to maintain pricing; future financial and operating performance of major customers and industries served by the Company; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; the success of commercial negotiations; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific product or customer events; the impact of competitive products and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; the Company’s ability to recover energy and raw material costs from customers; the Company’s ability to maintain and improve cost efficiency of operations; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory activities; successful development and market acceptance of new products and applications, the ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel in all regions of the world where the Company operates; the success of cost reduction and productivity programs; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring activities; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the continued availability of capital funding sources in all of the Company’s foreign operations; the impact of environmental, healthcare, tax or other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact of new or changed financial accounting guidance; the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized and other risk factors described in Section 1A. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. We mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases. In the past, we have also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oil-based feedstocks. There were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at 30 September 2011 and 2010. We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange-forward contracts, and foreign exchange-option contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position. The net financial instrument position at 30 September 2010 does not include available-for-sale securities of $103.6, as disclosed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. The available-for-sale securities in 2010 primarily included the investment in Airgas stock of $102.5, which was subsequently sold in 2011. At 30 September 2011 and 2010, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $4,261.1 and $4,128.2, respectively. The increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of long-term debt (excluding exchange rate impacts). The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date. Interest Rate Risk Our debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of 30 September 2011 primarily comprised debt denominated in U.S. dollars (50%) and Euros (41%), including the effect of currency swaps. This debt portfolio is composed of 47% fixed-rate debt and 53% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position. The sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2011, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $80 and $87 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2011 and 2010, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $85 and $95 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2011 and 2010, respectively. Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $23 and $22 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2011 and 2010, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $23 and $22 per year at 30 September 2011 and 2010, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2011 and 2010, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $271 and $345 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2011 and 2010, respectively. 40 Table of Contents The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the U.S. dollar versus the Pound Sterling. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows, along with foreign exchange-option contracts. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal (or more favorable in the case of purchased foreign exchange-option contracts) to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. 41 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:31.876786

All comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as noted. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for share data, unless otherwise indicated. Captions such as income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products, net income attributable to Air Products, and diluted earnings per share attributable to Air Products are simply referred to as “income from continuing operations,” “net income,” and “diluted earnings per share” throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise stated. The discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures. In 2012, the non-GAAP measures exclude the photovoltaic (PV) market actions charge, the polyurethane intermediates (PUI) business actions charge, the cost reduction plan charge, the customer bankruptcy charge, the gain on the previously held equity interest in DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC (DA NanoMaterials), the Spanish tax settlement, and the Spanish tax ruling. These non-GAAP measures exclude the net loss on Airgas transaction in 2011 and 2010. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis. The reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures is presented on pages 29-30. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries serve energy, electronics, chemicals, steel, and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric, process and specialty gases; performance materials; equipment; and technology. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 50 countries, we have sales of $9.6 billion, assets of $16.9 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 21,300 employees. We organize our operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. 2012 IN SUMMARY In 2012, the global economy proved to be more challenging than we expected and we did not see the anticipated economic growth we forecasted for the second half of the fiscal year. Global manufacturing grew approximately 3% for the year and limited the opportunities for growth, particularly in our Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Underlying volume growth was modest, and overall, sales declined by 1% resulting from a stronger dollar and lower energy cost pass-through partially offset by acquisitions. Our operating income declined 1% versus the prior year. In response to the current and forecasted economic environment, we took a number of important steps to position our global portfolio for future success. In Europe, we sold our homecare business and implemented a restructuring 18 program to better align our cost structure with the slower economy. We took actions to exit our polyurethane intermediates business and restructured our photovoltaic business to reflect current market conditions. Additionally, we executed on acquisition opportunities to support our growth strategies. In the Merchant segment, we acquired a controlling stake in Indura S.A., the largest independent gas company in Latin America. We also purchased a 25% position in Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG), the largest industrial gas company in Saudi Arabia. Finally, in Electronics, we purchased the remaining 50% share of our DA NanoMaterials joint venture. Highlights for 2012 • Sales of $9,611.7 decreased 1%, or $62.0, as unfavorable currency and lower energy raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers were partially offset by higher volumes and acquisitions. • Operating income of $1,282.4 decreased 15%, or $225.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,533.7 decreased 1%, or $22.9, with positive impacts from new plants onstream in the Tonnage segment offset by weaker Merchant, Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment volumes. Unfavorable impacts from a stronger dollar were partially offset by cost productivity, improved pricing, and the impact of acquisitions. • Income from continuing operations of $999.2 decreased 12%, or $135.1, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.66 decreased 11%, or $.56. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,158.6 decreased 1%, or $7.3, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.40 increased 1%, or $.04. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented below. • Capital spending was $2,559.8 for the year ended 30 September 2012. On a non-GAAP basis, capital spending of $2,778.3 increased 80%, primarily from the acquisition of Indura S.A and the construction of new plants under contract with customers, primarily in the Tonnage Gases segment. • We purchased .6 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of $53.1 under the $1,000 share repurchase program announced in the fourth quarter of 2011. At 30 September 2012, $946.9 in share repurchase authorization remains. • We increased our quarterly dividend from $.58 to $.64 per share. This represents the 30th consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to our 2013 Outlook discussions provided on page 20 in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis that follows. 19 Changes in Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to Air Products 2012 2011 Increase (Decrease) Diluted Earnings per Share Net income $5.44 $5.63 $(.19 ) Income from discontinued operations .78 .41 .37 Income from Continuing Operations—GAAP Basis $4.66 $5.22 $(.56 ) PV market actions .59 — .59 Cost reduction plan .28 — .28 PUI business actions .16 — .16 Customer bankruptcy .03 — .03 Gain on previously held equity interest (.25 ) — (.25 ) Q1 Spanish tax settlement .20 — .20 Q2 Spanish tax ruling (.27 ) — (.27 ) Net loss on Airgas transaction — .14 (.14 ) Income from Continuing Operations—Non-GAAP Basis $5.40 $5.36 $ .04 Operating income (after-tax) Underlying business Volume/acquisitions (.14 ) Price/raw materials .05 Costs .11 Currency (.10 ) Operating Income (.08 ) Other (after-tax) Interest expense (.03 ) Income tax rate .03 Noncontrolling interests .05 Average shares outstanding .07 Other .12 Total Change in Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations—Non-GAAP Basis $ .04 2013 OUTLOOK Our 2013 outlook for economic growth is based on the current lack of momentum we have experienced in the second half of 2012. We believe global economic growth in the regions in which we operate will again be modest in 2013 with a range from 2%–4%. We expect that the U.S. will continue to grow between 2%–4%. We do not anticipate any meaningful growth in Europe in the near future. In Asia, we expect below trend growth from 3%–5% as exports to other regions are slow. In South America, we expect growth of 2%–4%. We anticipate higher earnings in 2013 from new plant onstreams and from the loading of existing assets but recognize that this factor will be most influenced by the economy. We also anticipate higher earnings from our acquisition of Indura S.A. These gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense as a result of a decline in interest rates. We also expect lower earnings in 2013 as a result of restructuring our PUI business, unfavorable currency impacts, and a higher effective tax rate. We are focused on increasing productivity and managing costs in this challenging economic environment. The cost reduction actions implemented in 2012 should provide benefits in 2013 and beyond. Outlook by Segment • In Merchant Gases, volume growth will continue to be influenced by the economy. We have available capacity in each region and will continue to utilize new applications to drive growth. We expect the business to benefit from the 2012 cost reduction actions in Europe. Results should also benefit from the acquisition of Indura S.A. • Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from new plant onstreams in 2012 and 2013. These plants are supported by long-term take-or-pay contracts. 20 • We are hopeful that Electronics growth will begin to rebound in 2013 following a weak 2012. Overall, we expect silicon growth of 4%–6% in 2013. For Performance Materials, we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter of 2013 with volume growth limited until economic activity increases. • Equipment and Energy results are expected to improve due to higher activity in our LNG equipment business. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2012 2011 2010 Sales $9,611.7 $9,673.7 $8,616.1 Operating income—GAAP Basis 1,282.4 1,508.1 1,267.7 Operating income—Non-GAAP Basis 1,533.7 1,556.6 1,363.7 Operating margin—GAAP Basis 13.3 % 15.6 % 14.7 % Operating margin—Non-GAAP Basis 16.0 % 16.1 % 15.8 % Equity affiliates’ income 153.8 154.3 126.9 Sales % Change from Prior Year 2012 2011 Underlying business Volume 1 % 8 % Price — % 2 % Acquisitions 2 % — % Energy and raw material cost pass-through (2 )% — % Currency (2 )% 2 % Total Consolidated Change (1 )% 12 % 2012 vs. 2011 Sales of $9,611.7 decreased 1%, or $62.0. Underlying business increased 1%, primarily due to higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases segment, which were partially offset by lower volumes in the Merchant Gases segment, particularly in Europe. Acquisitions increased sales by 2%. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers and currency both decreased sales by 2%. 2011 vs. 2010 Sales of $9,673.7 increased 12%, or $1,057.6. Underlying business increased 10%, with volumes up 8% and price up 2%. Volumes grew primarily from strong performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases segment, and growth in Asia in the Merchant Gases segment. Currency favorably impacted sales 2%. Operating Income 2012 vs. 2011 Operating income of $1,282.4 decreased 15%, or $225.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,533.7 decreased 1%, or $22.9. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable volumes, including acquisitions, of $39 and unfavorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts of $30, partially offset by lower costs of $31 and higher recovery of raw material costs in pricing of $15. The decrease in volumes was primarily from lower Merchant Gases volumes and unfavorable volume mix due to lower LNG plant sales. On a GAAP basis, current year operating income includes a charge of $327.4 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans, a $9.8 charge for a customer bankruptcy, and the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9. The prior year operating income includes a $48.5 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. 2011 vs. 2010 Operating income of $1,508.1 increased 19%, or $240.4. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,556.6 increased 14%, or $192.9. Underlying business increased $171, primarily from higher volumes in all segments and 21 higher recovery of raw material costs in pricing, partially offset by higher operating costs. Favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts increased operating income by $22. On a GAAP basis, operating income in 2011 includes a $48.5 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. 2010 included a $96.0 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. Equity Affiliates’ Income 2012 vs. 2011 Income from equity affiliates of $153.8 decreased $.5. 2011 vs. 2010 Income from equity affiliates of $154.3 increased $27.4, or 22%. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes and price, and favorable currency and foreign exchange. Selling and Administrative Expense (S&A) 2012 vs. 2011 S&A expense of $946.8 increased $5.1, or 1%, primarily due to acquisitions and inflation, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and favorable currency. S&A as a percent of sales increased to 9.9% from 9.7%. 2011 vs. 2010 S&A expense of $941.7 increased $55.1, or 6%, primarily due to unfavorable currency, inflation, and higher pension expense. S&A as a percent of sales decreased to 9.7% from 10.3%. Research and Development (R&D) 2012 vs. 2011 R&D expense of $126.4 increased 6%, or $7.6, primarily due to the DA NanoMaterials acquisition. R&D as a percent of sales increased to 1.3% from 1.2%. 2011 vs. 2010 R&D expense of $118.8 increased 4%, or $4.1, primarily due to increased spending in the Energy business. R&D as a percent of sales decreased to 1.2% from 1.3%. Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans In 2012, we recorded an expense of $327.4 ($222.4 after-tax, or $1.03 per share) for business restructuring and cost reduction plans in our Polyurethane Intermediates, Electronics and European Merchant businesses. The net loss is reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans.” The charges for these plans are excluded from segment operating income. During the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an expense of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for actions to remove stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business, the reorganization of the Merchant business, and actions we are taking to right size our European cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook. This charge includes $80.8 for severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 600 positions and $6.0 for the write-down of certain assets. The charge relates to the businesses at the segment level as follows: $77.3 in Merchant Gases, $3.8 in Tonnage Gases, and $5.7 in Electronics and Performance Materials. The planned actions are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. By the end of 2013, we expect these actions to provide approximately $60 in annual savings. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed actions in the Polyurethane Intermediates (PUI) business to improve costs resulting in a net expense of $54.6 ($34.8 after-tax, or $.16 per share). We sold certain assets and the rights to a supply contract for $32.7 in cash at closing. A supply arrangement with terms at fair market value was established with the buyer to serve the retained product supply contracts so that our PUI production facility in Pasadena, Texas could permanently close. In connection with these actions, we recognized an expense of $26.6 for the net book value of assets sold and those committed to be disposed of other than by sale. The remaining charge was primarily related to contract terminations and an environmental liability. The PUI facility will be dismantled, with completion expected in fiscal year 2013. The costs to dismantle will be expensed as incurred and reflected in continuing operations in the Tonnage Gases business segment. Since we will have material ongoing involvement with the business through retained PUI product supply contracts, the results of this business will continue to be reflected in continuing operations in the Tonnage Gases Segment. 22 During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed an assessment of our position in the photovoltaic (PV) market resulting in $186.0 of expense ($127.0 after-tax, or $.59 per share) primarily related to the Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Air Products supplies the PV market with both bulk and onsite supply of gases including silane. The PV market has not developed as expected and as a result, the market capacity to produce silane is expected to exceed demand for the foreseeable future. As a result, we have entered into negotiations to terminate a long-term, take-or-pay contract. We recorded a charge of $93.5 for an offer that we made to terminate the contract. Although a settlement could differ from this amount, we do not expect it to be material to our financial position. It is uncertain when, or if, a settlement will be reached. The remaining charge was recorded in connection with the expected loss on purchase commitments, the disposal of certain assets serving PV and Electronics customers, the write-down of inventory to its net realizable value, and the write-down of accounts receivable. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans, and Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions. Business Combinations Indura S.A. On 1 July 2012, we acquired a 51.8% controlling equity interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A. from the majority shareholder. On 3 July 2012, we acquired an additional 13.0% equity interest from other shareholders. Following the acquisition date, 100% of the Indura S.A. results are consolidated in our financial statements. The portion of the business that is not owned by the Company is recorded as noncontrolling interests. We paid cash consideration in Chilean pesos (CLP) of 345.5 billion ($690) and assumed debt of CLP113.8 billion ($227) for these interests. The acquisition of Indura S.A. was accounted for as a business combination. The results of Indura S.A. have been consolidated within our Merchant Gases business segment. For the year ended 30 September 2012, our Merchant Gases business segment includes Indura S.A. revenues of $140.0 and operating income of $8.4, which is net of acquisition related costs we incurred of $6.5. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction. DA NanoMaterials LLC On 2 April 2012, we closed on the acquisition agreement with E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. to acquire their 50% interest in our joint venture DA NanoMaterials. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the results of DA NanoMaterials were consolidated within our Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Prior to the acquisition date, we accounted for our 50% interest in DA NanoMaterials as an equity-method investment. The year ended 30 September 2012 includes a gain of $85.9 ($54.6 after-tax, or $.25 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair market value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction. Net Loss on Airgas Transaction For the year ended 30 September 2011, $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share) in net loss was recognized related to the Airgas transaction. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Customer Bankruptcy As a result of events which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a charge of $9.8 ($6.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) primarily related to the write-off of onsite assets due to a customer bankruptcy and mill shutdown. The customer, which primarily received products from the Tonnage Gases segment, filed for bankruptcy in May 2012 and announced the mill shutdown in August 2012. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment’s results. We do not expect to recognize additional charges related to this customer. In April 2010, one of our customers emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. We received a final settlement in the amount of $22.4, of which $16.0 was applied against the remaining outstanding receivables. Income of $6.4 ($4.0 after-tax, or $.02 per share) was recognized for the recovery of certain receivables that had been previously written off. 23 Pension Settlement Our U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the participant’s retirement date. We recognize pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. We recognized $11.5 of settlement charges in 2010. Other Income, Net Items recorded to other income arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income is presented in Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2012 vs. 2011 Other income of $47.1 increased $5.4, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange and reimbursements from government grants for expense, partially offset by lower gains from the sale of assets. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2011 vs. 2010 Other income of $41.7 decreased $1.2, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange, offset mainly by reimbursements from government grants for expenses. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. Interest Expense 2012 2011 2010 Interest incurred $153.9 $138.2 $136.2 Less: Capitalized interest 30.2 22.7 14.3 Interest Expense $123.7 $115.5 $121.9 2012 vs. 2011 Interest incurred increased $15.7. The increase was driven primarily by a higher average debt balance and debt issuance costs related to the Indura S.A. acquisition, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest. The change in capitalized interest was driven by an increase in project spending which qualified for capitalization. 2011 vs. 2010 Interest incurred increased $2.0. The increase was driven by the impact of a weaker dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest, partially offset by a lower average debt balance. The change in capitalized interest was driven by an increase in project spending which qualified for capitalization. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2012 vs. 2011 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 21.9% and 24.3% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The current year rate includes reductions in income tax expense of $105.0 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans, $58.3 related to the second quarter Spanish tax ruling, and $3.7 related to the customer bankruptcy charge, offset by an increase to income tax expense of $43.8 related to the first quarter Spanish tax settlement and $31.3 related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans; Note 5, Business Combinations; Note 21, Income Taxes; and Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions.

The tax rate included reductions in income tax expense of $16.9 and $35.9 for the Airgas transaction in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for details on this transaction. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.6% and 25.0% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Discontinued Operations In January 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which had previously been reported as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment. On 8 January 2012, we reached an agreement for The Linde Group to purchase our Homecare business in Belgium, Germany, France, Portugal, and Spain. This business represented approximately 80% of our total Homecare business revenues. The transaction with Linde closed on 30 April 2012. Total sale proceeds of €590 million ($777) were received in cash at closing. A gain of $207.4 ($150.3 after-tax, or $.70 per share) was recognized on the sale of this business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. We are actively marketing the remaining portion of the Homecare business, which is primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We hope to close on the sale of this business before the end of calendar year 2012. In the third quarter of 2012, we recorded an impairment charge of $33.5 ($29.5 after-tax, or $.14 per share) to write down the remaining business to its estimated net realizable value. Additional charges may be recorded in future periods, dependent upon the timing and method of ultimate disposition. The Homecare business is being accounted for as a discontinued operation. The results of operations and cash flows of this business have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction.

Other Other operating loss primarily includes other expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses. Also included are LIFO inventory adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO, and the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate general and administrative costs and research and development costs are fully allocated to the business segments. Other also included stranded costs resulting from discontinued operations, as these costs were not reallocated to the businesses. 2012 vs. 2011 Other operating loss was $6.6, compared to $39.3 in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in stranded costs, a decrease in the LIFO pool adjustment as a result of decreases in inventory values and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by gains on asset sales in the prior year. 2011 vs. 2010 Other operating loss was $39.3, compared to $26.7 in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the LIFO pool adjustment as a result of significant increases in inventory values and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by gains on asset sales. 28 RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis. Presented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures.

We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of 30 September 2012, we had $423.3 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of continuing operations of $454.4. If the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the U.S. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the U.S. Further, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate foreign funds in order to fund U.S. operations. Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2012 2011 2010 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $1,765.1 $1,710.4 $1,485.0 Investing activities (2,435.2 ) (1,169.8 ) (1,014.3 ) Financing activities (78.4 ) (484.6 ) (579.3 ) Operating Activities For the year ended 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $1,765.1. Income from continuing operations of $999.2 reflected the non-cash gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9, the write-down of long-lived assets associated with restructuring and a customer bankruptcy of $80.2, and a non-cash tax benefit of $58.3 recognized as a result of the second quarter Spanish tax ruling. Income from continuing operations is adjusted for other non-cash items that include depreciation and amortization, undistributed earnings of equity affiliates, share-based compensation expense, and noncurrent capital lease receivables. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $100.1. The provision for the cost reduction and business restructuring plans resulted in an increase to accrued liabilities of $223.9, partially offset by a use of cash of $32.9 for payments made in relation to these plans. For the year ended 2011, cash provided by operating activities was $1,710.4. Income from continuing operations of $1,134.3 reflected the non-cash net loss of $48.5 related to the Airgas transaction. We also made cash payments of $156.2 related to the Airgas transaction. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $114.6, including $107.5 for an increase in inventory primarily to support growth in our Performance Materials business. For the year ended 2010, cash provided by operating activities was $1,485.0. Income from continuing operations of $941.6 reflected the non-cash net loss of $96.0 related to the Airgas transaction. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $362.6, including $104.9 for an increase in accounts receivable from higher sales and $281.3 for a decrease in accrued liabilities primarily due to pension plan contributions. Investing Activities For the year ended 30 September 2012, cash used for investing activities was $2,435.2, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment and cash used for acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. In the fourth quarter, we acquired a controlling stake in Indura S.A. for $690. During the third quarter, we acquired E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc.’s 50% interest in our joint venture DA NanoMaterials for $147. We also purchased a 25% equity interest in Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG), an unconsolidated affiliate, for $155 in the third quarter. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, and Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the Indura S.A., DA NanoMaterials, and AHG transactions. For the year ended 30 September 2011, cash used for investing activities was $1,169.8, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment. We received proceeds of $94.7 from the sale of approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction. For the year ended 30 September 2010, cash used for investing activities was $1,014.3, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment. Additionally, we purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6. 31 Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2012 2011 2010 Additions to plant and equipment $1,521.0 $1,309.3 $988.7 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 863.4 10.8 37.2 Short-term borrowings associated with SAGA acquisition (A) — — 60.9 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 175.4 45.8 4.8 Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $2,559.8 $1,365.9 $1,091.6 Capital lease expenditures (B) 212.2 173.5 122.6 Noncurrent liability related to purchase of shares from noncontrolling interests (B) 6.3 — 42.0 Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $2,778.3 $1,539.4 $1,256.2 (A) Noncash transaction. (B) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2012 totaled $2,559.8, compared to $1,365.9 in 2011, resulting in an increase of $1,193.9. Additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses during both 2012 and 2011. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Additional 2012 capital expenditures included the following items: $690 for a controlling interest in Indura S.A., $147 for E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc.’s 50% interest in our joint venture DA NanoMaterials, and $155 for a 25% equity interest in AHG. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2012 totaled $2,778.3 compared to $1,539.4 in 2011. Capital lease expenditures of $212.2 increased by $38.7, reflecting higher project spending. 2013 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2013 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,750 and $1,850, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $2,000 and $2,200. The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases which are expected to be between $250 and $350. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with approximately $1,000 associated with new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. Financing Activities For the year ended 2012, cash used for financing activities was $78.4. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $419.6 and included the issuances of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.0% note on 3 November 2011 and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note on 13 September 2012, which were partially offset by the repayment of a 4.25% Eurobond of $400.3 on 10 April 2012. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $124.3 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders were a use of cash of $514.9. For the year ended 2011, cash used for financing activities was $484.6. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $457.0 and included $234.3 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances as well as a $350.0 senior fixed-rate 2.0% note, which were partially offset by $156.0 in U.S. medium-term note maturities. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $148.2 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders and the purchase of 7.4 million treasury shares were uses of cash of $456.7 and $649.2, respectively. For the year ended 2010, cash used for financing activities was $579.3. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net use of cash (repayment) of $284.4 and included a $306.8 Eurobond and $74.2 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt repayments partially offset by $85.0 from the issuance of 32 an industrial revenue bond. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $88.1 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders were a use of cash of $398.7. Discontinued Operations The sale of our European homecare business to The Linde Group generated proceeds of $776.6 and is included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2012 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations, the sale of our European homecare business, and the issuance of long-term debt. At the end of 2012, total debt outstanding was $5,291.9 compared to $4,561.5, and cash and cash items were $454.4 compared to $421.4. Total debt at 30 September 2012 and 2011, expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt and total equity, was 44.4% and 43.4%, respectively. Proceeds from long-term debt were $900.4. This included the issuance of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.0% note on 3 November 2011 that matures on 3 November 2021, which was used for general corporate purposes. Additionally, a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note on 13 September 2012 that matures on 15 October 2017 was issued primarily to refinance commercial paper associated with the Indura S.A. business combination. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. An acquisition financing facility was arranged with Banco Santander, Chile to provide the initial financing required for the Indura S.A. business combination. This was a Chilean Peso (CLP) committed credit facility with a total commitment amount of CLP390 billion ($778). Of this facility, CLP347 billion ($693) was drawn on 3 July 2012 to fund the business combination and related expenses, and the balance of the commitment was cancelled. This facility was fully repaid on 2 August 2012, primarily with proceeds from U.S. commercial paper issuance. A portion of this commercial paper was subsequently refinanced with the $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note described above. As of 30 September 2011, a 4.25% Eurobond for $400.3 maturing in 2012 was classified as long-term debt because of our ability to refinance the debt under our $2,170.0 committed credit facility maturing in 2015 and our intent to refinance via the U.S. or European public or private placement markets. During the first quarter of 2012, we reclassified this Eurobond from long-term debt to current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as we no longer intended to refinance it. The Eurobond was repaid on its maturity date of 10 April 2012, principally from proceeds of commercial paper issuance. During fiscal year 2011, we increased our total multicurrency facility to a total of $2,170.0 maturing on 30 June 2015. Our only financial covenant is a leverage ratio (long-term debt divided by the sum of long-term debt plus equity) of no greater than 60%. As of 30 September 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under these commitments. Effective 11 June 2012, we entered into an offshore Chinese Renminbi (RMB) syndicated credit facility of RMB1,000.0 million ($158.7), maturing in June 2015. There are RMB200.0 million ($31.7) in outstanding borrowings under this commitment at 30 September 2012. Additional commitments totaling $400.0 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $387.0 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2012. We are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. We have classified a 4.15% senior note for $300.0 maturing in 2013 as long-term debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under our $2,170.0 committed credit facility maturing in 2015. Our current intent is to refinance this debt via the U.S. public or private placement markets. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. During fiscal year 2012, .6 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of $53.1. At 30 September 2012, $946.9 in share repurchase authorization remains. 2013 Outlook Cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2013, primarily driven by debt maturities. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. Dividends On 15 March 2012, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.58 per share to $.64 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. 33 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2012: Payments Due By Period Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $4,659 $374 $573 $406 $433 $418 $2,455 Contractual interest 632 123 99 85 74 55 196 Capital leases 3 1 1 1 — — — Operating leases 273 60 56 40 28 21 68 Pension obligations 1,247 275 82 84 92 96 618 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,927 780 153 144 143 119 588 Other liabilities 11 11 — — — — — Total Contractual Obligations $8,752 $1,624 $964 $760 $770 $709 $3,925 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $1,501 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2012, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2012. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 11, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Approximately $800 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. We have a supply agreement for the purchase of silane gas that is not matched to a customer sales contract having terms extending to ten years. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we made an offer to terminate the contract; however, no settlement has been reached. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $592 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2013. 34 We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. In total, we purchase approximately $7.2 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above. Other Liabilities We have an obligation to purchase 2% of the remaining shares of Indura S.A. within twelve months of the acquisition date for CLP5.0 billion ($11) based on a multiple of earnings formula, which is reflected in other liabilities at 30 September 2012. This liability was reported in payables and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of 30 September 2012. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, and Note 22, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2012 were $670.8. Refer to Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2012 were $110.8. These tax liabilities were not included in the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year. Discontinued Operations Other noncurrent liabilities as of 30 September 2012 included $141 for the contingent proceeds related to the sale of our Homecare business. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We did not include this amount in the Contractual Obligations table due to the uncertainty in timing of any payments. Put Options We currently have outstanding put option agreements with other shareholders of our Air Products San Fu Company, Ltd. and Indura S.A. subsidiaries. The put options give the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing, we excluded the potential payments from the Contractual Obligations table. PENSION BENEFITS We sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans—the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. For 2012, the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $3,239.1 from $2,823.7 in 2011. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $4,486.5 and $3,765.5 in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2012 2011 2010 Pension expense $120.4 $114.1 $109.0 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 8.2 1.3 14.8 Weighted average discount rate 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.6 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 8.0 % 8.0 % 8.2 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 3.9 % 4.0 % 4.1 % 2012 vs. 2011 Pension expense in 2012, net of special items, was comparable to 2011 expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year. 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in pension expense, net of special items, was primarily attributable to the 60 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions in 2011. Expense in 2011 included $1.3 of special termination and settlement charges. 35 2013 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $175 to $180 in 2013, an increase of $55 to $60 from 2012, resulting primarily from a decline in discount rates. In 2013, pension expense will include approximately $144 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $96.0 in 2012. Net actuarial losses of $358.6 were incurred in 2012, resulting primarily from a 100 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, partially offset by actual asset returns above expected returns. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2013. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. We analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2012 and 2011, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $76.4 and $241.0, respectively. Cash contributions to defined benefit plans, including benefit payments for unfunded plans, are estimated to be approximately $275 in 2013. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 34 for a projection of future contributions. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, we are involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $44.7, $34.0, and $31.6 in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that in 2012 and 2011, we spent approximately $4 and $6, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $4 and $5 in 2013 and 2014, respectively. We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $87 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $101. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2012 and 2011 included an accrual of $87.5 and $82.3, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; Paulsboro, New Jersey; and the Pasadena, Texas locations is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. 36 Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada and South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. At the U.S. state level, California’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted, and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer is set to begin 1 January 2013. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. We do not have any derivative instruments indexed to our own stock. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. We did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties. INFLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years’ inflation. While some inflationary pressures existed during the first half of fiscal year 2012, inflation in the U.S. has been modest for several years. In addition, we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates, with inflationary pressures that differ from those in the U.S. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2012 totaled $8,240.6, and depreciation expense totaled $813.7 during 2012. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. 37 Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. We have numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Additionally, we have several customer supply contracts within the Equipment and Energy segment with contract terms that are primarily 5 to 10 years. The depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease LifeBy 1 Year Increase LifeBy 1 Year Merchant Gases $28 $(19 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $20 $(14 ) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from 38 estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $126.4, was $1,724.8 as of 30 September 2012. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Goodwill increased in 2012 primarily as a result of the Indura S.A. acquisition in Merchant Gases. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements. We perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. We have designated our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, we have four business segments and thirteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. We determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. We primarily use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows, to determine fair value of a reporting unit. Our valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. Intangible Assets Intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 September 2012 totaled $663.9 and consisted primarily of customer relationships as well as purchased patents and technology. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2012 totaled $97.7 and consisted primarily of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually. In addition, these intangible assets are tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. To determine fair value, we utilize an income approach, the royalty savings method. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,175.7 at 30 September 2012. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. 39 In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2012, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $48.5 and $475.7, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2012 were $110.8, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2012 was $287.3. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 21, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $13. Pension Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. This rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $25 per year. 40 The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns, and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $15 per year. We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets. This method recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $12 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management’s Discussion and Analysis release contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about business outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, deterioration in global or regional economic and business conditions; weakening demand for the Company’s products and services; future financial and operating performance of major customers; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; the success of commercial negotiations; asset impairments or losses due to a decline in profitability of or demand for certain of the Company’s products or businesses, or specific product or customer events; the impact of competitive products and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory activities; successful development 41 and market acceptance of new products and applications; the ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel in all regions of the world where the Company operates; the success of productivity programs; the success and impact of restructuring and cost reduction initiatives; achieving anticipated acquisition synergies; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; the continued availability of capital funding sources for all of the Company’s foreign operations; the impact of environmental, tax, or other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact of new or changed financial accounting guidance; the impact on the effective tax rate of changes in the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations; and other risk factors described in Section 1A. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. We mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases. In the past, we have also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oil-based feedstocks. There were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at 30 September 2012 and 2011. We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. At 30 September 2012 and 2011, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $4,925.1 and $4,261.1, respectively. The increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of long-term debt (excluding exchange rate impacts). The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date. Interest Rate Risk Our debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of 30 September 2012 primarily comprised debt denominated in U.S. dollars (50%) and Euros (29%), including the effect of currency swaps. This debt portfolio is composed of 51% fixed-rate debt and 49% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position. The sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2012, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $150 and $105 in the net liability position of financial instruments 42 at 30 September 2012 and 2011, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $162 and $113 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2012 and 2011, respectively. Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $26 and $23 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2012 and 2011, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $26 and $23 per year at 30 September 2012 and 2011, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2012 and 2011, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $274 and $271 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2012 and 2011, respectively. The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the U.S. dollar versus the Pound Sterling. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. 43",2023-12-30 20:42:33.791991

All comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated. All amounts presented are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except as noted. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, except for share data, unless otherwise indicated. Items such as income from continuing operations attributable to Air Products, net income attributable to Air Products, and diluted earnings per share attributable to Air Products are simply referred to as “income from continuing operations,” “net income,” and “diluted earnings per share” throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, unless otherwise stated. The discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures. For 2013, the non-GAAP measures exclude the fourth quarter business restructuring and cost reduction plan and advisory costs. For 2012, the non-GAAP measures exclude the 2012 business restructuring and cost reduction plans (the photovoltaic (PV) market actions charge, the polyurethane intermediates (PUI) business actions charge, and the cost reduction plan charge), the customer bankruptcy charge, the gain on the previously held equity interest in DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC (DA NanoMaterials), the Spanish tax settlement, and the Spanish tax ruling. For 2011, the non-GAAP measures exclude the net loss on Airgas transaction. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis. The reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures is presented on pages 29–31. Descriptions of the excluded items appear on pages 22–24. 18 Table of Contents BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries serve energy, electronics, chemicals, metals, and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric, process and specialty gases; performance materials; equipment; and technology. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 50 countries, in 2013 we had sales of $10.2 billion, assets of $17.9 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 21,600 employees. We organize our operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments. 2013 IN SUMMARY In 2013, we achieved both sales and earnings growth. Our results did fall short of the expectations we set at the beginning of the year as a result of slower than expected global economic growth. Global manufacturing grew approximately 2% for the year and limited the opportunities for growth, particularly in our Europe and Asia Merchant Gases and Electronics businesses. Overall, sales increased by 6% resulting from acquisitions and higher energy cost pass-through. Our underlying sales were 1% higher on strength in our Tonnage Gases businesses, higher Performance Materials volumes, and LNG equipment activity partially offset by weakness in our Electronics equipment area. The impact from winding down our PUI business decreased underlying sales by 2%. Our operating income and diluted earnings per share both increased 2% versus the prior year. While the difficult global economic environment persisted, we took actions to offset this weakness and to improve results in the future. We delivered significant cost savings from the 2012 European focused reorganization and committed to additional actions aimed at reducing costs through product exits and asset rationalizations, as well as organizational improvements. The additional actions are focused on improving our Electronics business, restructuring our global operations function, and further optimizing our cost structure in Europe. Finally, we remain on track to exit our PUI business in fiscal year 2014 as we continue to manage our business portfolio. Highlights for 2013 • Sales of $10,180.4 increased 6%, or $568.7, as acquisitions and higher energy contractual cost pass-through to customers were partially offset by lower volumes from our previously announced decision to exit the PUI business. • Operating income of $1,324.4 increased 3%, or $42.0. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,566.1 increased 2%, or $32.4, with acquisitions and favorable volume mix partially offset by higher energy and distribution costs and higher operating costs, including pensions. • Income from continuing operations of $1,004.2 increased 1%, or $5.0, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.73 increased 2%, or $.07. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,168.5 increased 1%, or $9.9, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.50 increased 2%, or $.10. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share, including a non-GAAP reconciliation, is presented below. • Capital spending was $1,747.8 for the year ended 30 September 2013. On a non-GAAP basis, capital spending of $1,996.7 decreased 28%, primarily from the prior year acquisition of Indura S.A. • We purchased 5.7 million of our outstanding shares at a cost of $461.6. • We increased our quarterly dividend by 11% from $.64 to $.71 per share. This represents the 31st consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment.

We expect that the U.S. will grow 2%–4% as it continues to face unresolved fiscal challenges, weak job growth, low consumer confidence, and lower global demand. We are hopeful that an economic recovery will begin in Europe with growth of 0%–2%. In Asia, we expect a gradual acceleration in growth, particularly in China, of 5%–7%. In South America, we expect growth of 1%–3%, which is largely dependent on global demand driving exports. We anticipate higher earnings in 2014 from new plant onstreams, higher LNG activity, and volume loading on existing assets, recognizing that the last factor will be most influenced by the economy. Pension expense should be lower as a result of higher interest rates. These positive impacts will be partially offset by higher maintenance expense and more shares outstanding. We also expect lower earnings from the shutdown of our PUI business. The cost reduction actions implemented in 2012 and 2013 should provide benefits in 2014 and beyond. Outlook by Segment • In Merchant Gases, volume growth will continue to be influenced by the economy. We have available capacity in each region and expect that an improving economy will increase loading on these assets and drive growth. We expect each region of the business to benefit from the 2013 cost reduction actions. • Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from new plant onstreams supported by long-term take-or-pay contracts. However, we also expect higher planned plant maintenance costs from scheduled customer outages and the unfavorable impact of our exit from the PUI business. 20 Table of Contents • We expect that Electronics growth will begin to rebound in 2014 following a weak 2012 and 2013. Overall, we expect silicon growth of 3%–5% in 2014. Additionally, we expect the business to benefit from the 2013 cost reduction actions and product line restructuring. For Performance Materials, we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter of 2014, with volume growth improving due to a better economy. • Equipment and Energy results are expected to improve due to continued higher activity in our LNG equipment business. The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2013 2012 2011 Sales $10,180.4 $9,611.7 $9,673.7 Operating income—GAAP Basis 1,324.4 1,282.4 1,508.1 Operating margin—GAAP Basis 13.0 % 13.3 % 15.6 % Equity affiliates’ income 167.8 153.8 154.3 Operating income—Non-GAAP Basis 1,566.1 1,533.7 1,556.6 Operating margin—Non-GAAP Basis 15.4 % 16.0 % 16.1 % Sales % Change from Prior Year 2013 2012 Underlying business Volume (1 )% 1 % Price — % — % Acquisitions 5 % 2 % Energy and raw material cost pass-through 2 % (2 )% Currency — % (2 )% Total Consolidated Change 6 % (1 )% 2013 vs. 2012 Sales of $10,180.4 increased 6%, or $568.7. Underlying business decreased 1%, primarily due to lower volumes resulting from our previous decision to exit the PUI business and lower Electronics demand, partially offset by higher volumes in the Tonnage Gases, Performance Materials, and Equipment businesses. The acquisitions of Indura S.A. and DA NanoMaterials increased sales by 5%. Higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 2%. 2012 vs. 2011 Sales of $9,611.7 decreased 1%, or $62.0. Underlying business increased 1%, primarily due to higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases segment, which were partially offset by lower volumes in the Merchant Gases segment, particularly in Europe. Acquisitions increased sales by 2%. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers and currency both decreased sales by 2%. Operating Income 2013 vs. 2012 Operating income of $1,324.4 increased 3%, or $42.0. Current year operating income included a charge of $231.6 for a business restructuring and cost reduction plan and $10.1 for advisory costs. Prior year operating income included a charge of $327.4 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans, a $9.8 charge for a customer bankruptcy, and the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,566.1 increased 2%, or $32.4. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions of $54, higher volumes of $24, and favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts of $2, partially offset by $40 from unfavorable higher energy and distribution costs net of pricing, and higher operating costs of $20, including the impact from pensions. Operating income increased by $12 from higher gains on the sale of assets and investments. 21 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Operating income of $1,282.4 decreased 15%, or $225.7. Operating income in 2012 includes a charge of $327.4 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans, a $9.8 charge for a customer bankruptcy, and the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9. Operating income in 2011 includes a $48.5 net loss related to the Airgas transaction. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,533.7 decreased 1%, or $22.9. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable volumes, including acquisitions, of $39 and unfavorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts of $30, partially offset by lower costs of $31 and higher recovery of raw material costs in pricing of $15. The decrease in volumes was primarily from lower Merchant Gases volumes and unfavorable volume mix due to lower LNG plant sales. Equity Affiliates’ Income 2013 vs. 2012 Income from equity affiliates of $167.8 increased $14.0, primarily due to better performance in our Mexican equity affiliate. 2012 vs. 2011 Income from equity affiliates of $153.8 decreased $.5. Selling and Administrative Expense 2013 vs. 2012 Selling and administrative expense of $1,066.3 increased $119.5, or 13%, primarily due to the acquisition of Indura S.A. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales increased to 10.5% from 9.9%, also due to Indura S.A. 2012 vs. 2011 Selling and administrative expense of $946.8 increased $5.1, or 1%, primarily due to acquisitions and inflation, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and favorable currency. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales increased to 9.9% from 9.7%. Research and Development 2013 vs. 2012 Research and development expense of $133.7 increased 6%, or $7.3, primarily due to inflation and the acquisition of DA NanoMaterials. Research and development expense as a percent of sales was 1.3% in 2013 and 2012. 2012 vs. 2011 Research and development expense of $126.4 increased 6%, or $7.6, primarily due to the DA NanoMaterials acquisition. Research and development expense as a percent of sales increased to 1.3% from 1.2%. Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans We recorded charges in 2013 and 2012 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans. The charges for these plans are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Business restructuring and cost reduction plans.” The charges for these plans are excluded from segment operating income. 2013 Plan During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an expense of $231.6 ($157.9 after-tax, or $.74 per share) reflecting actions to better align our cost structure with current market conditions. These charges include $100.4 for asset actions and $58.5 for the final settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract primarily impacting the Electronics business due to continued weakness in the PV and light-emitting diode (LED) markets. In addition, $71.9 was recorded for severance, benefits, and other contractual obligations associated with the elimination of approximately 700 positions and executive changes. These charges primarily impact our Merchant Gases businesses and corporate functions. The actions are in response to weaker than expected business conditions in Europe and Asia, reorganization of our operations and functional areas, and previously announced senior executive changes. The planned actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2014. We expect $45 in savings in 2014. Beyond 2014, we expect these actions to provide approximately $75 in annual savings. 2012 Plans In 2012, we recorded an expense of $327.4 ($222.4 after-tax, or $1.03 per share) for business restructuring and cost reduction plans in our PUI, Electronics, and European Merchant businesses. During the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an expense of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for actions to remove stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business, the reorganization of the 22 Table of Contents Merchant business, and actions taken to right size our European cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook. The planned actions are complete and provided approximately $60 in annual savings in 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we took actions in the PUI business to improve costs, resulting in a net expense of $54.6 ($34.8 after-tax, or $.16 per share), and ultimately exit the business. Our PUI facility in Pasadena, Texas, is currently being dismantled, with completion expected in fiscal year 2014. The costs to dismantle are expensed as incurred and are reflected in continuing operations in the Tonnage Gases business segment. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed an assessment of our position in the PV market, resulting in $186.0 of expense ($127.0 after-tax, or $.59 per share) primarily related to the Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Included in the charge was an accrual of $93.5 for an offer that we made to terminate a long-term take-or-pay supply contract to purchase silane. As noted above, a final settlement was reached with the supplier in the fourth quarter of 2013. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions. Business Combinations 2013 Business Combinations We completed three acquisitions in 2013. The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations, and their results of operations were consolidated within their respective segments after the acquisition dates. The aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired, for these acquisitions was $233 and resulted in recognition of $68 of goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. On 30 August 2013, we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in Guiyang, China. This acquisition included a long-term sale of gas contract within our Tonnage Gases segment and provided our Merchant Gases segment with additional liquid capacity in the region. On 31 May 2013, we acquired EPCO Carbondioxide Products, Inc. (EPCO), the largest independent U.S. producer of liquid carbon dioxide (CO2). This acquisition expanded our North American offerings of bulk industrial process gases in the Merchant Gases business segment. On 1 April 2013, we acquired Wuxi Chem-Gas Company, Ltd. (WCG). This acquisition provided our Merchant Gases segment with additional gases presence in the Jiangsu Province of China. 2012 Business Combinations Indura S.A. In July 2012, we acquired a 64.8% controlling equity interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A. Following the acquisition date, 100% of the Indura S.A. results are consolidated in our financial statements within the Merchant Gases business segment. The portion of the business that is not owned by the Company is recorded as noncontrolling interests. We paid cash consideration in Chilean pesos (CLP) of 345.5 billion ($690) and assumed debt of CLP113.8 billion ($227) for these interests. As of 30 September 2013, we hold a 67.2% interest. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction. DA NanoMaterials LLC On 2 April 2012, we closed on the acquisition agreement with E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. to acquire their 50% interest in our joint venture, DA NanoMaterials. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the results of DA NanoMaterials were consolidated within our Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Prior to the acquisition date, we accounted for our 50% interest in DA NanoMaterials as an equity-method investment. The year ended 30 September 2012 included a gain of $85.9 ($54.6 after-tax, or $.25 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair market value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this transaction. Net Loss on Airgas Transaction For the year ended 30 September 2011, $48.5 ($31.6 after-tax, or $.14 per share) in net loss was recognized related to the Airgas transaction. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Customer Bankruptcy As a result of events which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a charge of $9.8 ($6.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) primarily related to the write-off of on-site assets due to a customer bankruptcy and mill 23 Table of Contents shutdown. The customer, which primarily received products from the Tonnage Gases segment, filed for bankruptcy in May 2012 and announced the mill shutdown in August 2012. Pension Settlement Loss Our U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the retirement date. Pension settlements are recognized when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. The participant’s vested benefit is considered fully settled upon cash payment of the lump sum. We recognized $12.4 of settlement charges in 2013. Advisory Costs During the fourth quarter of 2013, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $10.1 ($6.4 after-tax, or $.03 per share) in connection with our response to the rapid acquisition of a large position in shares of our common stock by Pershing Square Capital Management LLC and its affiliates (Pershing Square). These fees, which are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Advisory costs,” include costs incurred before and after Pershing Square’s disclosure of its holdings and cover advisory services related to the adoption of the Shareholders Rights Plan, preparation for a potential proxy solicitation campaign, and entering into an agreement with Pershing Square. Other Income (Expense), Net Items recorded to other income (expense), net arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income (expense), net is presented in Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2013 vs. 2012 Other income (expense), net of $70.2 increased $23.1, primarily due to higher gains from the sale of a number of small assets and investments and a favorable commercial contract settlement, partially offset by lower government grants. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2012 vs. 2011 Other income (expense), net of $47.1 increased $5.4, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange and reimbursements from government grants for expense, partially offset by lower gains from the sale of assets. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. Interest Expense 2013 2012 2011 Interest incurred $167.6 $153.9 $138.2 Less: Capitalized interest 25.8 30.2 22.7 Interest Expense $141.8 $123.7 $115.5 2013 vs. 2012 Interest incurred increased $13.7. The increase was driven primarily by a higher average debt balance for $41, partially offset by a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio of $24. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in project spending and a lower average interest rate. 2012 vs. 2011 Interest incurred increased $15.7. The increase was driven primarily by a higher average debt balance and debt issuance costs related to the Indura S.A. acquisition, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest. The change in capitalized interest was driven by an increase in project spending which qualified for capitalization. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2013 vs. 2012 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 22.8% and 21.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The current year rate includes income tax benefits of $73.7 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans and $3.7 for the advisory costs. The prior year rate includes income tax benefits of $105.0 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans, $58.3 related to the second quarter Spanish tax ruling, and $3.7 related to the customer 24 Table of Contents bankruptcy charge, offset by income tax expense of $43.8 related to the first quarter Spanish tax settlement and $31.3 related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans; Note 5, Business Combinations; Note 22, Income Taxes; and Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% in both 2013 and 2012. 2012 vs. 2011 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 21.9% and 24.3% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The tax rate in 2012 includes income tax benefits of $105.0 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans, $58.3 related to the second quarter Spanish tax ruling, and $3.7 related to the customer bankruptcy charge, offset by income tax expense of $43.8 related to the first quarter Spanish tax settlement and $31.3 related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Plans; Note 5, Business Combinations; Note 22, Income Taxes; and Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions.

Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for details on this transaction. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% and 24.6% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Discontinued Operations During the second quarter of 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which had previously been reported as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment. On 30 April 2012, we sold the majority of our Homecare business to The Linde Group for sale proceeds of €590 million ($777) and recognized a gain of $207.4 ($150.3 after-tax, or $.70 per share). During the third quarter of 2012, an impairment charge of $33.5 ($29.5 after-tax, or $.14 per share) was recorded to write down the remaining business, which is primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland, to its estimated net realizable value. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an additional charge of $18.7 ($13.6 after-tax, or $.06 per share) to update our estimate of the net realizable value as we continue to market the business for sale. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this business.

Also included are LIFO inventory valuation adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO, and the LIFO pool valuation adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Other also included stranded costs resulting from discontinued operations, as these costs were not reallocated to the businesses in 2012. 2013 vs. 2012 Other operating loss was $4.7, compared to $6.6 in the prior year. The current year includes an unfavorable LIFO adjustment versus the prior year of $11. The prior year loss included stranded costs from discontinued operations of $10. 2012 vs. 2011 Other operating loss was $6.6, compared to $39.3 in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in stranded costs, a decrease in the LIFO adjustment as a result of decreases in inventory values, and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by gains on asset sales in the prior year. 28 Table of Contents RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The discussion of our annual results includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by removing certain items which management does not believe to be indicative of on-going business trends and allow evaluation of our baseline performance on a comparable basis. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures. Presented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We maintained a strong financial position throughout 2013. We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of 30 September 2013, we had $438.3 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $450.4. If the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the U.S. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the U.S. Current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds. Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities of continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2013 2012 2011 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $1,553.1 $1,765.1 $1,710.4 Investing activities (1,697.0 ) (2,435.2 ) (1,169.8 ) Financing activities 115.4 (78.4 ) (484.6 ) Operating Activities For the year ended 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $1,553.1. Income from continuing operations of $1,004.2 reflected the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $100.4. Income from continuing operations is adjusted for other non-cash items that include depreciation and amortization, undistributed earnings of equity affiliates, share-based compensation expense, and noncurrent capital lease receivables. The Other adjustments included a use of cash of $300.8 for pension contributions, partially offset by $178.2 of pension and other postretirement expense. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $207.8. The reduction of accrued liabilities of $130.3 includes $185.8 for payments made in relation to the prior year cost reduction and 31 Table of Contents business restructuring actions, including the settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract. The current year payments were partially offset by a $69.7 net increase to accrued liabilities for the current year cost reduction and business restructuring actions. For the year ended 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $1,765.1. Income from continuing operations of $999.2 reflected the non-cash gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9, the write-down of long-lived assets associated with restructuring and a customer bankruptcy of $80.2, and a non-cash tax benefit of $58.3 recognized as a result of the second quarter Spanish tax ruling. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $100.1. The provision for the cost reduction and business restructuring plans resulted in an increase to accrued liabilities of $223.9, partially offset by a use of cash of $32.9 for payments made in relation to these plans. For the year ended 2011, cash provided by operating activities was $1,710.4. Income from continuing operations of $1,134.3 reflected the non-cash net loss of $48.5 related to the Airgas transaction. We also made cash payments of $156.2 related to the Airgas transaction. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $114.6, including $107.5 for an increase in inventory primarily to support growth in our Performance Materials business. Investing Activities For the year ended 30 September 2013, cash used for investing activities was $1,697.0, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment and acquisitions. For the year ended 30 September 2012, cash used for investing activities was $2,435.2, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment, acquisitions, and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section below for additional detail. For the year ended 30 September 2011, cash used for investing activities was $1,169.8, primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment. We received proceeds of $94.7 from the sale of approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock. Refer to Note 6, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2013 2012 2011 Additions to plant and equipment $1,524.2 $1,521.0 $1,309.3 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 224.9 863.4 10.8 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates (1.3 ) 175.4 45.8 Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $1,747.8 $2,559.8 $1,365.9 Capital lease expenditures (A) 234.9 212.2 173.5 Noncurrent liability related to purchase of shares from noncontrollinginterests (A) 14.0 6.3 — Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $1,996.7 $2,778.3 $1,539.4 (A) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2013 totaled $1,747.8, compared to $2,559.8 in 2012, resulting in a decrease of $812.0, primarily due to the acquisition of Indura S.A. in 2012. Additions to plant and equipment are largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Spending in 2013 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification in China, hydrogen to the global market, and renewable energy in the U.K. In 2013, we completed three acquisitions with an aggregate cash use, net of cash acquired, of $224.9. In the fourth quarter, we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in Guiyang, China. During the third quarter, we acquired EPCO, the largest independent U.S. producer of liquid carbon dioxide (CO2), and WCG. In 2012, we acquired a controlling stake in Indura S.A. for $690 and E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc.’s 50% interest in our joint venture, DA NanoMaterials for $147. We also purchased a 25% equity interest in Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG), an unconsolidated affiliate, for $155 in the third quarter. 32 Table of Contents Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, and Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisitions and the investment in AHG. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2013 totaled $1,996.7 compared to $2,778.3 in 2012. Capital lease expenditures of $234.9 increased by $22.7, reflecting higher project spending. 2014 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2014 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,800 and $1,900, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,900 and $2,100. The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases, which are expected to be between $100 and $200. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with approximately $1,000 expected for new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. Financing Activities For the year ended 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $115.4. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $927.4 and included $437.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and the issuances of a €300 million ($397) 2.0% Eurobond on 7 August 2013, and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 2.75% note on 4 February 2013, which were partially offset by the repayment of a $300.0 senior fixed-rate 4.15% note on 1 February 2013. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash of $226.4. The primary uses of cash were to purchase 5.7 million shares of treasury stock for $461.6 and to pay dividends of $565.6. For the year ended 2012, cash used for financing activities was $78.4. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $419.6 and included the issuances of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.0% note on 3 November 2011 and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note on 13 September 2012, which were partially offset by the repayment of a 4.25% Eurobond of $400.3 on 10 April 2012. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $124.3 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders were a use of cash of $514.9. For the year ended 2011, cash used for financing activities was $484.6. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $457.0 and included $234.3 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances as well as a $350.0 senior fixed-rate 2.0% note, which were partially offset by $156.0 in U.S. medium-term note maturities. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $148.2 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders and the purchase of 7.4 million treasury shares were uses of cash of $456.7 and $649.2, respectively. Discontinued Operations For the year ended 2013, cash provided by discontinued operations was $13.1. For the year ended 2012, the sale of our European Homecare business to The Linde Group generated proceeds of $776.6 and is included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2013 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations and the issuance of debt. At the end of 2013, total debt outstanding was $6,273.6 compared to $5,291.9 at the end of 2012, and cash and cash items were $450.4 compared to $454.4 at the end of 2012. Total debt at 30 September 2013 and 2012, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest) was 45.3% and 43.0%, respectively. Proceeds from long-term debt were $927.2. This included the issuance of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 2.75% note on 4 February 2013 that matures on 3 February 2023, and a €300 million ($397) 2.0% Eurobond was issued on 7 August 2013 that matures on 7 August 2020; both were issued for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. On 30 April 2013, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “2013 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The 2013 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. We entered into this agreement to increase the previously existing facility by $330.0, extend the maturity date to 30 April 2018, and modify the financial covenant. The Company’s only financial covenant is a 33 Table of Contents maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization of 70%. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2013. The 2013 Credit Agreement terminates and replaces the Company’s $2,170.0 revolving credit agreement dated 8 July 2010, as subsequently amended, which was to mature 30 June 2015 and had a financial covenant of long-term debt divided by the sum of long-term debt plus equity of no greater than 60%. No borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement at the time of its termination, and no early termination penalties were incurred. Effective 11 June 2012, we entered into an offshore Chinese Renminbi (RMB) syndicated credit facility of RMB1,000.0 million ($163.5), maturing in June 2015. There are RMB250.0 million ($40.9) in outstanding borrowings under this commitment at 30 September 2013. Additional commitments totaling $383.0 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $309.0 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2013. An acquisition financing facility was arranged with Banco Santander, Chile to provide the initial financing required for the Indura S.A. business combination. This was a Chilean Peso (CLP) committed credit facility with a total commitment amount of CLP390 billion ($778). Of this facility, CLP347 billion ($693) was drawn on 3 July 2012 to fund the business combination and related expenses, and the balance of the commitment was cancelled. This facility was fully repaid on 2 August 2012, primarily with proceeds from U.S. commercial paper issuance. A portion of this commercial paper was subsequently refinanced with the $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note issued on 13 September 2012 that matures on 15 October 2017. As of 30 September 2013, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. As of 30 September 2013, we classified $400.0 of commercial paper as long-term debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under our $2,500.0 committed credit facility maturing in 2018. Our current intent is to refinance this debt via the U.S. public or private placement markets. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. During fiscal year 2013, 5.7 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of $461.6. At 30 September 2013, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains. 2014 Outlook Cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2014, primarily to refinance commercial paper. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. Dividends On 21 March 2013, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.64 per share to $.71 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2013: Payments Due By Period Total 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $5,564 $907 $453 $433 $454 $440 $2,877 Contractual interest 714 126 111 99 79 62 237 Capital leases 2 1 1 — — — — Operating leases 286 69 50 36 25 20 86 Pension obligations 593 95 85 95 100 100 118 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,470 821 104 104 80 65 296 Discontinued operations 148 148 — — — — — Total Contractual Obligations $8,777 $2,167 $804 $767 $738 $687 $3,614 34 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $1,454 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2013, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2013. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Approximately $700 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $625 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2014. We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. In total, we purchase approximately $7.7 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2013 were $827.2. Tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2013 were $124.3. These tax liabilities were excluded from the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations Payables and accrued liabilities as of 30 September 2013 include $148 for the contingent proceeds related to the sale of our Homecare business. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 35 Table of Contents Put Options We currently have outstanding put option agreements with other shareholders of our Air Products San Fu Company, Ltd. and Indura S.A. subsidiaries. The put options give the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing, we excluded the potential payments from the Contractual Obligations table. PENSION BENEFITS We sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans—the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. For 2013, the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $3,800.8 from $3,239.1 in 2012. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $4,394.0 and $4,486.5 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2013 2012 2011 Pension expense $169.7 $120.4 $114.1 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 19.8 8.2 1.3 Weighted average discount rate 4.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 7.7 % 8.0 % 8.0 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 3.8 % 3.9 % 4.0 % 2013 vs. 2012 The increase in pension expense, excluding special items, was primarily attributable to the 100 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and contributions in 2013. Special items of $19.8 primarily included $12.4 for pension settlement losses and $6.9 for special termination benefits relating to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. 2012 vs. 2011 Pension expense in 2012, excluding special items, was comparable to 2011 expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year. 2014 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $140 to $145, excluding special items, in 2014, a decrease of $5 to $10 from 2013, resulting primarily from an increase in discount rates, partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality and inflation assumptions. Pension settlement losses of $10 to $25 are expected, dependent on the timing of retirements. In 2014, pension expense will include approximately $118 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $143 in 2013. Net actuarial gains of $370.4 were recognized in 2013, resulting primarily from an approximately 65 bp increase in the weighted average discount rate as well as actual asset returns above expected returns. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2014. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2013 and 2012, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $300.8 and $76.4, respectively. Contributions for 2013 include voluntary contributions for U.S. plans of $220.0. 36 Table of Contents For 2014, cash contributions to defined benefit plans, including benefit payments for unfunded plans, are estimated to be $80 to $100. Contributions to unfunded plans are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 34 for a projection of future contributions. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $37.1, $44.7, and $34.0 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $4 in both 2013 and 2012 on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $4 in both 2014 and 2015. We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $86 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $100. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2013 and 2012 included an accrual of $86.7 and $87.5, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; Paulsboro, New Jersey; and Pasadena, Texas, locations is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and California’s cap and trade scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada, and South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. At the U.S. state level, California’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted, and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began 1 January 2013. We have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also 37 Table of Contents developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. We did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties. INFLATION We operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2013 totaled $8,974.0, and depreciation expense totaled $864.7 during 2013. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. We have numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Additionally, we have several customer supply contracts within the Equipment and Energy segment with contract terms that are primarily 5 to 10 years. The depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset. 38 Table of Contents The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease LifeBy 1 Year Increase LifeBy 1 Year Merchant Gases $30 $(20 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $16 $(10 ) Impairment of Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $126.4, was $1,780.2 as of 30 September 2013. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Goodwill increased in 2013, primarily as a result of the EPCO and WCG acquisitions in Merchant Gases during the third quarter. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements. We perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, we have four business segments and thirteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. As part of the goodwill impairment testing, and as permitted under the accounting guidance, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the 39 Table of Contents initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required. The first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we primarily use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital-intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. If the first step of the quantitative test indicates potential impairment, the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill would be compared to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill was greater than its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recorded. During 2013, there were no events or changes in circumstances identified that warranted interim goodwill impairment testing. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment utilizing the quantitative approach. We determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. Intangible Assets Intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 September 2013 totaled $626.7 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2013 totaled $90.6 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value prior to performing the additional quantitative testing. To determine fair value, we utilize an income approach, the royalty savings method. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we conducted the required annual impairment test utilizing the quantitative approach and determined that the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded its carrying value. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,195.5 at 30 September 2013. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key 40 Table of Contents assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2013, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $63.0 and $662.7, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2013 were $124.3, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2013 was $307.9. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $14. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. This rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $30 per year. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical 41 Table of Contents performance of plan assets. In determining asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $18 per year. We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for fixed income investments is the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets. The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $16 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about earnings guidance and business outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, weakening or reversal of global or regional economic recovery; future financial and operating performance of major customers; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; the impact of competitive products and pricing; interruption in ordinary sources of supply of raw materials; unanticipated asset impairments or losses; the impact of price fluctuations in natural gas; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory investigations; the impact of management and organizational changes, including the chief executive officer search; the success of productivity programs; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future 42 Table of Contents acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; political risks, including the risks of unanticipated government actions that may result in project delays, cancellations or expropriations; the impact of changes in environmental, tax or other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact on the effective tax rate of changes in the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations; and other risk factors described in Section 1A. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases. Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. At 30 September 2013 and 2012, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $5,719.5 and $4,925.1, respectively. The increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of long-term debt (excluding exchange rate impacts). The increase in book value was primarily driven by the issuance of a 2.0% Eurobond for €300.0 million ($397.0) on 7 August 2013 that matures on 7 August 2020 and the classification of $400.0 of commercial paper as long-term debt due to our ability and intent to refinance the debt under our $2,500.0 committed credit facility maturing in 2018. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date. Interest Rate Risk Our debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of 30 September 2013 primarily comprised debt denominated in U.S. dollars (52%) and Euros (28%), including the effect of currency swaps. This debt portfolio is composed of 54% fixed-rate debt and 46% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position. The sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2013, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $143 and $150 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $154 and $162 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively. 43 Table of Contents Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $29 and $26 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $29 and $26 per year at 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2013 and 2012, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $295 and $274 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2013 and 2012, respectively. The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the Euro versus the Pound Sterling. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. 44 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:33.938065

For 2013, the non-GAAP measures exclude the business restructuring and cost reduction plan charges and advisory costs. For 2012, the non-GAAP measures exclude the business restructuring and cost reduction plan charges, the customer bankruptcy charge, the gain on the previously held equity interest in DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC (DA NanoMaterials), the Spanish tax settlement, and the Spanish tax ruling. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our performance. The reconciliation of reported GAAP results to non-GAAP measures is presented on pages 30–32. Descriptions of the excluded items appear on pages 23–25. 19 Table of Contents BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries serve energy, electronics, chemicals, metals, and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric, process and specialty gases; performance materials; equipment; and technology. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 50 countries, in 2014 we had sales of $10.4 billion, assets of $17.8 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 21,200 employees. We organized our operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy through 30 September 2014. The financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on those operations. On 18 September 2014, we announced a major company reorganization effective as of 1 October 2014. Refer to Note 25, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments and segment reorganization beginning fiscal year 2015. 2014 IN SUMMARY In 2014, we delivered sales and earnings growth driven by a strong second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. Overall, sales increased by 3% including volume growth of 2% led by our Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Volume growth was leveraged along with recent cost reduction actions to improve operating income by 6% and operating margin by 50 basis points (bp). Tonnage Gases results decreased versus the prior year as we completed the exit of our polyurethane intermediates business (PUI) and experienced higher maintenance costs and customer outages. In the third quarter, we announced Seifi Ghasemi as our new chairman, president and chief executive officer, effective as of 1 July 2014. In the fourth quarter, we announced plans to reorganize the Company, including realignment of our businesses into new reporting segments and organizational changes effective as of 1 October 2014. We recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $310.1 in our Merchant Gases Latin America business driven by lower economic growth and profitability in our Indura business and the impact of recent tax reform legislation in Chile. We also recorded charges of $5.5 for pension settlements and $12.7 for severance costs related to cost reduction actions. Highlights for 2014 • Sales of $10,439.0 increased 3%, or $258.6. Volume growth in the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments and higher energy contractual cost pass-through to customers were partially offset by the exit from our PUI business. • Operating income of $1,328.2 increased $3.8. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,656.5 increased 6%, or $90.4, with higher volumes partially offset by higher energy and distribution costs and higher operating costs, including maintenance costs in the Tonnage Gases segment. • We increased focus on cash flow and introduced Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $2,764.8 increased by $123.9, or 5%. • Income from continuing operations of $987.1 decreased 2%, or $17.1, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.59 decreased 3%, or $.14. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,243.0 increased 6%, or $74.5, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.78 increased 5%, or $.28. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share, including a non-GAAP reconciliation, is presented below. • We increased our quarterly dividend by 8% from $.71 to $.77 per share. This represents the 32nd consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to our 2015 Outlook discussions provided on page 21 in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis that follows. 20 Table of Contents Changes in Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to Air Products 2014 2013 Increase(Decrease) Diluted Earnings per Share Net income $4.61 $4.68 $(.07 ) Income (Loss) from discontinued operations .02 (.05 ) .07 Income from Continuing Operations—GAAP Basis $4.59 $4.73 $(.14) Business restructuring and cost reduction actions .04 .74 (.70 ) Pension settlement loss .02 — .02 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 1.27 — 1.27 Advisory costs — .03 (.03 ) Chilean tax rate change .10 — .10 Tax election benefit (.24 ) — (.24 ) Income from Continuing Operations—Non-GAAP Basis $5.78 $5.50 $.28 Operating income (after-tax) Underlying business Volume .50 Price/raw materials (.10 ) Costs/other (.06 ) Currency (.01 ) Operating Income .33 Other (after-tax) Equity affiliates’ income (.05 ) Interest expense .05 Income tax rate .01 Noncontrolling interests .01 Average shares outstanding (.07 ) Other (.05 ) Total Change in Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations—Non-GAAP Basis $.28 2015 OUTLOOK For 2015, we are focused on actions that we can control to improve cash flow and drive earnings growth. We reorganized the Company into new business segments effective as of 1 October 2014. Our new organization should enable us to reduce costs and more effectively manage and utilize our existing assets. We also expect pricing actions to deliver improvement in our results. Effectively executing on this strategy will be critical to improved results as we expect global economic growth to be modest in the year ahead. The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” 21 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2014 2013 2012 Sales $10,439.0 $10,180.4 $9,611.7 Operating income—GAAP Basis 1,328.2 1,324.4 1,282.4 Operating margin—GAAP Basis 12.7 % 13.0 % 13.3 % Equity affiliates’ income 151.4 167.8 153.8 Non-GAAP Basis Adjusted EBITDA 2,764.8 2,640.9 2,528.3 Operating income 1,656.5 1,566.1 1,533.7 Operating margin 15.9 % 15.4 % 16.0 % Sales % Change from Prior Year 2014 2013 Underlying business Volume (including PUI exit impact) 2 % (1 )% Price — % — % Acquisitions — % 5 % Energy and raw material cost pass-through 1 % 2 % Total Consolidated Change 3 % 6 % 2014 vs. 2013 Sales of $10,439.0 increased 3%, or $258.6. Underlying business increased 2%, as higher volumes in the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments were partially offset by lower volumes in our Tonnage Gases segment, including the exit from our PUI business which reduced sales by 1%. Higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 1%. Currency was flat as the impacts from a stronger Euro were offset by a weaker Chilean Peso. 2013 vs. 2012 Sales of $10,180.4 increased 6%, or $568.7. Underlying business decreased 1%, primarily due to lower volumes resulting from our previous decision to exit the PUI business and lower Electronics demand, partially offset by higher volumes in the Tonnage Gases, Performance Materials, and Equipment businesses. The acquisitions of Indura S.A. and DA NanoMaterials increased sales by 5%. Higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 2%. Operating Income 2014 vs. 2013 On a GAAP basis, operating income of $1,328.2 increased $3.8. Current year operating income was reduced by $310.1 for a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, $12.7 for a business reorganization and cost reduction charge, and $5.5 for pension settlement losses. Prior year operating income was reduced by a charge of $231.6 for a business restructuring and cost reduction plan and $10.1 for advisory costs. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,656.5 increased 6%, or $90.4. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes of $140 driven by our Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments, partially offset by lower recovery of raw material costs in pricing of $29 and higher operating costs of $9. Prior year operating income included $10 for gains from the sale of assets and investments in Merchant Gases. 2013 vs. 2012 On a GAAP basis, operating income of $1,324.4 increased 3%, or $42.0. Operating income in 2013 included a charge of $231.6 for a business restructuring and cost reduction plan and $10.1 for advisory costs. Operating income in 2012 included a charge of $327.4 for business restructuring and cost reduction plans, a $9.8 charge for a customer bankruptcy, and the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,566.1 increased 2%, or $32.4. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions of $54, higher volumes of $24, and favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts of $2, partially offset by $40 from unfavorable higher energy and distribution costs net of pricing, and higher operating costs of $20, 22 Table of Contents including the impact from pensions. Operating income increased by $12 from higher gains on the sale of assets and investments. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of ongoing business trends, before interest expense, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful operational metric for the measurement of our cash flow. 2014 vs. 2013 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,764.8 increased $123.9, or 5%, primarily due to the increase in volumes in the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. 2013 vs. 2012 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,640.9 increased $112.6, or 4%, primarily due to acquisitions and higher volumes, partially offset by higher energy, distribution, and operating costs. Equity Affiliates’ Income 2014 vs. 2013 Income from equity affiliates of $151.4 decreased $16.4, due to higher costs from maintenance outages and an unfavorable arbitration award, unfavorable currency impacts, and weaker oilfield services volume in Mexico. 2013 vs. 2012 Income from equity affiliates of $167.8 increased $14.0, primarily due to better performance in our Mexican equity affiliate. Selling and Administrative Expense 2014 vs. 2013 Selling and administrative expense of $1,059.3 decreased $7.0, or 1%, as productivity, including the benefits of recent cost reduction actions, and favorable currency effects more than offset other cost increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 10.1% from 10.5%. 2013 vs. 2012 Selling and administrative expense of $1,066.3 increased $119.5, or 13%, primarily due to the acquisition of Indura S.A. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales increased to 10.5% from 9.9%, also due to Indura S.A. Research and Development 2014 vs. 2013 Research and development expense of $141.4 increased 6%, or $7.7, primarily due to lower government grants and other cost increases. Research and development expense as a percent of sales increased to 1.4% from 1.3%. 2013 vs. 2012 Research and development expense of $133.7 increased 6%, or $7.3, including the acquisition of DA NanoMaterials. Research and development expense as a percent of sales was 1.3% in 2013 and 2012. Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions We recorded charges in 2014, 2013, and 2012 for business restructuring and cost reduction actions. The charges for these actions are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Business restructuring and cost reduction actions.” The charges for these actions are excluded from segment operating income. 2014 Charge On 18 September 2014, we announced plans to reorganize the Company, including realignment of our businesses into new reporting segments and organizational changes, effective as of 1 October 2014. As a result of this initiative, we will incur ongoing severance and other charges. During the fourth quarter of 2014, an expense of $12.7 ($8.2 after-tax, or $.04 per share) was incurred relating to the elimination of approximately 50 positions. In 2015 and beyond, we expect the actions taken to date will provide approximately $10 in annual savings. Additional charges will be recorded in future periods as the Company commits to specific actions. These actions could materially impact future operating profit for the period in which the charges are recorded. 23 Table of Contents 2013 Plan During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an expense of $231.6 ($157.9 after-tax, or $.74 per share) reflecting actions to better align our cost structure with current market conditions. These charges included $100.4 for asset actions and $58.5 for the final settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract primarily impacting the Electronics business due to continued weakness in the PV and light-emitting diode (LED) markets. In addition, $71.9 was recorded for severance, benefits, and other contractual obligations associated with the elimination of approximately 700 positions and executive changes. These reductions primarily impact our Merchant Gases businesses and corporate functions. The actions were in response to weaker than expected business conditions in Europe and Asia, reorganization of our operations and functional areas, and previously announced senior executive changes. The remaining planned actions associated with severance were completed in the first quarter of 2015 and provided approximately $45 in savings in 2014. Beyond 2014, we expect these actions to provide approximately $75 in annual savings. 2012 Plans In 2012, we recorded an expense of $327.4 ($222.4 after-tax, or $1.03 per share) for business restructuring and cost reduction plans in our PUI, Electronics, and European Merchant businesses. During the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an expense of $86.8 ($60.6 after-tax, or $.28 per share) for actions to remove stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business, the reorganization of the Merchant business, and actions taken to right size our European cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook. The planned actions are complete and provided approximately $60 in annual savings in 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we took actions in the PUI business to improve costs, resulting in a net expense of $54.6 ($34.8 after-tax, or $.16 per share), and ultimately exit the business. We completed our exit from the business in the first quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed an assessment of our position in the PV market, resulting in $186.0 of expense ($127.0 after-tax, or $.59 per share) primarily related to the Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Included in the charge was an accrual of $93.5 for an offer that we made to terminate a long-term take-or-pay supply contract to purchase silane. As noted above, a final settlement was reached with the supplier in the fourth quarter of 2013. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions. Pension Settlement Loss Our U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the retirement date. Pension settlements are recognized when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. The participant’s vested benefit is considered fully settled upon cash payment of the lump sum. We recognized $5.5 ($3.6 after-tax, or $.02 per share) and $12.4 ($7.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share) of settlement charges in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charge In July 2012, we acquired a controlling interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A., a Latin American industrial gases company. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $626.2 of goodwill, which was incorporated into the Latin American reporting unit of our Merchant Gases segment. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily acquired trade names) associated with this reporting unit were impaired. The Indura business continues to be profitable; however, recent economic conditions in Latin America, including the impact of tax legislation in Chile, have been less favorable due to increasing inflation, a decline in Chilean manufacturing growth, and weaker export demand for many commodities. As a result, we concluded in the fourth quarter that this business will not grow at the rate we anticipated, and we lowered our growth projections. We recorded a noncash impairment charge of $310.1 ($275.1 attributable to Air Products, after-tax or $1.27 per share) for the Latin America reporting unit. Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below and Note 9, Goodwill, and Note 10, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. 24 Table of Contents Business Combinations 2013 Business Combinations We completed three acquisitions in 2013. The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations, and their results of operations were consolidated within their respective segments after the acquisition dates. The aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired, for these acquisitions was $233. 2012 Business Combinations Indura S.A. In July 2012, we acquired a 64.8% controlling equity interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A. Following the acquisition date, 100% of the Indura S.A. results are consolidated in our financial statements within the Merchant Gases business segment. The portion of the business that is not owned by the Company is recorded as noncontrolling interests. We paid cash consideration in Chilean pesos (CLP) of 345.5 billion ($690) and assumed debt of CLP113.8 billion ($227) for these interests. As of 30 September 2014, we hold a 67.3% interest. DA NanoMaterials LLC On 2 April 2012, we closed on the acquisition agreement with E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc. to acquire their 50% interest in our joint venture, DA NanoMaterials. Beginning in the third quarter of 2012, the results of DA NanoMaterials were consolidated within our Electronics and Performance Materials business segment. Prior to the acquisition date, we accounted for our 50% interest in DA NanoMaterials as an equity-method investment. The year ended 30 September 2012 included a gain of $85.9 ($54.6 after-tax, or $.25 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair market value as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these transactions. Customer Bankruptcy As a result of events which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2012, we recognized a charge of $9.8 ($6.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) primarily related to the write-off of on-site assets due to a customer bankruptcy and mill shutdown. The customer, which primarily received products from the Tonnage Gases segment, filed for bankruptcy in May 2012 and announced the mill shutdown in August 2012. Advisory Costs During the fourth quarter of 2013, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $10.1 ($6.4 after-tax, or $.03 per share) in connection with our response to the rapid acquisition of a large position in shares of our common stock by Pershing Square Capital Management LLC and its affiliates (Pershing Square). These fees, which are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Advisory costs,” include costs incurred before and after Pershing Square’s disclosure of its holdings and cover advisory services related to the adoption of the Shareholders Rights Plan, preparation for a potential proxy solicitation campaign, and entering into an agreement with Pershing Square. Other Income (Expense), Net Items recorded to other income (expense), net arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income (expense), net is presented in Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2014 vs. 2013 Other income (expense), net of $52.8 decreased $17.4, primarily due to higher gains from the sale of a number of small assets and investments, higher government grants, and a favorable commercial contract settlement in the prior year. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2013 vs. 2012 Other income (expense), net of $70.2 increased $23.1, primarily due to higher gains from the sale of a number of small assets and investments and a favorable commercial contract settlement, partially offset by lower government grants. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 25 Table of Contents Interest Expense 2014 2013 2012 Interest incurred $158.1 $167.6 $153.9 Less: Capitalized interest 33.0 25.8 30.2 Interest Expense $125.1 $141.8 $123.7 2014 vs. 2013 Interest incurred decreased $9.5. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio which reduced interest by $13, partially offset by a higher average debt balance which increased interest by $6. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a higher carrying value in construction in progress. 2013 vs. 2012 Interest incurred increased $13.7. The increase was driven primarily by a higher average debt balance for $41, partially offset by a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio of $24. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in project spending and a lower average interest rate. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2014 vs. 2013 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 27.0% and 22.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher in the current year primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $305.2, which was not deductible for tax purposes, and the Chilean tax reform enacted in September 2014 which increased income tax expense by $20.6. These impacts were partially offset by an income tax benefit of $51.6 associated with losses from transactions and a tax election in a non-U.S. subsidiary. The prior year rate included income tax benefits of $73.7 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans and $3.7 for the advisory costs. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions; Note 9, Goodwill; Note 22, Income Taxes; and Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.0% and 24.2% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. 2013 vs. 2012 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 22.8% and 21.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The effective rate in 2013 includes income tax benefits of $73.7 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans and $3.7 for the advisory costs. The effective rate in 2012 includes income tax benefits of $105.0 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plans, $58.3 related to the second quarter Spanish tax ruling, and $3.7 related to the customer bankruptcy charge, offset by income tax expense of $43.8 related to the first quarter Spanish tax settlement and $31.3 related to the gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials. Refer to Note 4, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions; Note 5, Business Combinations; Note 22, Income Taxes; and Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements for details on these transactions. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% in both 2013 and 2012. Discontinued Operations During the second quarter of 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which had previously been reported as part of the Merchant Gases operating segment. In 2012, we sold the majority of our Homecare business to The Linde Group for sale proceeds of €590 million ($777) and recognized a gain of $207.4 ($150.3 after-tax, or $.70 per share). In addition, an impairment charge of $33.5 ($29.5 after-tax, or $.14 per share) was recorded to write down the remaining business, which was primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland, to its estimated net realizable value. In 2013, we recorded an additional charge of $18.7 ($13.6 after-tax, or $.06 per share) to update our estimate of the net realizable value. In 2014, a gain of $3.9 was recognized for the sale of the remaining Homecare business and settlement of contingencies on the sale to The Linde Group. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this business. 26 Table of Contents Segment Analysis Merchant Gases 2014 2013 2012 Sales $4,250.7 $4,098.6 $3,662.4 Operating income 671.6 680.5 644.0 Operating margin 15.8 % 16.6 % 17.6 % Equity affiliates’ income 140.1 145.0 137.1 Merchant Gases Sales % Change from Prior Year 2014 2013 Underlying business Volume 3 % — % Price 1 % 1 % Acquisition — % 11 % Currency — % — % Total Merchant Gases Sales Change 4 % 12 % 2014 vs. 2013 Underlying sales increased 4% due to higher volumes of 3% and higher pricing of 1%. In the U.S. and Canada, sales increased 7%, with volumes up 3% and price up 4%. Volumes increased as higher liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon volumes were partially offset by lower helium volumes due to supply limitations. Volumes also increased as a result of our EPCO Carbondioxide Products, Inc. acquisition. Pricing was higher due to improved pricing in liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, and helium. In Europe, sales increased 4%, with favorable currency impacts of 4%, primarily from the Euro and the Pound Sterling. Volumes were flat as higher volumes in liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon were offset by lower helium volumes and lower cylinder volumes as construction remains weak. In Asia, sales increased 4% due to higher volumes of 5%, partially offset by lower pricing of 1%. Volumes increased with higher liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon volumes across the region, partially offset by lower helium volumes. Pricing decreased as higher helium pricing was more than offset by lower pricing in liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, particularly in China, driven in part by a higher mix of wholesale customers. In Latin America, sales decreased 8%, as higher volumes of 1%, and higher pricing of 2% was more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 11% from the Brazilian Real and Chilean Peso. Volumes increased in Brazil and were only modestly higher in Chile as the economy slowed. Operating income decreased 1%, primarily due to higher operating costs of $25, prior year gains from sales of assets and investments of $10, and lower price recovery of power and fuel costs of $3, partially offset by higher volumes of $31. Operating margin decreased 80 basis points (bp) from prior year, primarily due to higher power and fuel costs. Merchant Gases equity affiliates’ income of $140.1 decreased $4.9, primarily from unfavorable currency impacts in Mexico, South Africa, and India and lower oilfield services volume in Mexico. 2013 vs. 2012 Underlying sales increased 1% due to higher pricing of 1%. The acquisition of Indura S.A. had a favorable impact on sales of 11%. In the U.S. and Canada, sales increased 5%, with volumes up 2% and price up 3%. Volumes increased primarily due to higher liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen, partially offset by helium supply limitations. In Europe, sales decreased 3%, with volumes down 3% primarily due to overall economic weakness in the region. In Asia, sales increased 3% due to higher volumes of 2% and favorable currency of 2%, partially offset by lower pricing of 1%. Volumes increased primarily due to higher liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes. Operating income increased 6%, primarily due to higher acquisitions of $48 and lower operating costs of $13, partially offset by lower price recovery of power and fuel costs of $25 and lower volumes of $10. The lower operating costs included the impact from the prior year cost reduction plan in Europe, partially offset by higher pension costs. 27 Table of Contents Operating income in 2013 also included $10 for gains from sales of assets and investments. Operating margin decreased 100 bp, primarily due to the impact of the Indura S.A. acquisition and higher power and fuel costs. Merchant Gases equity affiliates’ income of $145.0 increased $7.9, primarily as a result of improved performance in our Mexican equity affiliate.

Higher energy contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 3%. Currency favorably impacted sales by 1%. Operating income decreased primarily due to higher costs of $22, including maintenance, and lower volumes of $9. Operating margin decreased 50 bp from prior year, primarily due to the higher maintenance costs and higher pass-through of energy costs. 2013 vs. 2012 Volumes decreased 1%, as the impact from implementation of our previous decision to exit the PUI business was partially offset by the impact of new plants. Higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 6%. Currency favorably impacted sales by 1%. Operating income increased as higher volumes of $22 and favorable currency of $3 were partially offset by higher costs of $21, including higher maintenance and pension costs. Operating margin decreased 80 bp, primarily due to the higher energy cost pass-through and higher costs, partially offset by the higher volumes from new plants.

Electronics sales increased 8%, as higher delivery systems equipment sales and materials volumes of 8% and favorable currency of 1% were partially offset by lower pricing of 1%. Performance Materials sales increased 10%, as higher volumes of 11% were partially offset by lower pricing of 1%. The higher volumes were across all product lines and major regions. The lower pricing was primarily due to unfavorable mix impacts. Operating income of $425.3 increased 32%, or $104.0, primarily from higher volumes of $93, lower operating costs of $31, and favorable currency impacts of $5, partially offset by unfavorable price and mix impacts of $26. Operating margin of 17.4% increased 310 bp, primarily due to improved loading and leverage from the higher volumes and improved cost performance, partially offset by the unfavorable pricing impacts. 2013 vs. 2012 Sales decreased 3%, as lower volumes of 4% and lower pricing of 1% were partially offset by acquisitions of 2%. Electronics sales decreased 8%, as weaker materials volumes and equipment sales were partially offset by the acquisition of DA NanoMaterials. Performance Materials sales increased 2%, as higher volumes of 4% were partially offset by lower pricing of 2%. The increase in volumes was primarily due to strength in the automobile and U.S. housing markets partially offset by weaker volumes to certain construction markets and marine coatings. The lower pricing was primarily due to unfavorable mix impacts. Operating income of $321.3 decreased 25%, or $104.3, and operating margin of 14.3% decreased 400 bp, as 2012 included a gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $321.3 decreased 5%, or $18.4, primarily from unfavorable price and mix impacts of $15, lower volumes of $9, and higher operating costs of $4 partially offset by higher acquisitions of $6 and favorable currency of $4. Operating margin decreased 30 bp, primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable price mix. Equipment and Energy 2014 2013 2012 Sales $450.4 $451.1 $420.1 Operating income 88.2 65.5 44.6 2014 vs. 2013 Sales of $450.4 were relatively flat as higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) project activity was offset by lower air separation (ASU) project activity. Operating income of $88.2 increased from the higher LNG project activity. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2014 was $520, compared to $402 at 30 September 2013. The increase was primarily due to new LNG orders as global project development activity remains high. It is expected that approximately $320 of the backlog will be completed during 2015. 2013 vs. 2012 Sales of $451.1 increased primarily from higher LNG project activity. Operating income of $65.5 increased from the higher LNG project activity. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2013 was $402, compared to $450 at 30 September 2012. Other Other operating income (loss) primarily includes other expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses. Also included are LIFO inventory valuation adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO, and the LIFO pool valuation adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Other also included stranded costs resulting from discontinued operations, as these costs were not reallocated to the businesses in 2012. 2014 vs. 2013 Other operating loss was $13.5, compared to $4.7 in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange losses of $5 and LIFO adjustments of $4. 2013 vs. 2012 Other operating loss was $4.7, compared to $6.6 in the prior year. The other operating loss in 2013 includes an unfavorable LIFO adjustment versus the prior year of $11. The other operating loss in 2012 included stranded costs from discontinued operations of $10. 29 Table of Contents RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The discussion of our annual results includes comparisons to non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which our management uses internally to evaluate our operating performance and cash flow. Definitions of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures. In 2013, we had pension settlement losses of $12.4 ($7.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share). In 2012, our income tax provision was unfavorably impacted by $14.1 ($.07 per share) due to changes in the Chilean tax rate. These impacts were included in non-GAAP operating performance measures in their respective years. Presented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures.

We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of 30 September 2014, we had $330.3 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $336.6. If the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the U.S. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the U.S. Current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds. Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities of continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2014 2013 2012 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $2,186.4 $1,553.1 $1,765.1 Investing activities (1,638.0 ) (1,697.0 ) (2,435.2 ) Financing activities (504.3 ) 115.4 (78.4 ) Operating Activities For the year ended 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $2,186.4. Income from continuing operations of $987.1 reflected the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $310.1. Income from continuing operations is adjusted for other noncash items that include depreciation and amortization, undistributed earnings of equity affiliates, share-based compensation expense, and noncurrent capital lease receivables. Other adjustments included a source of cash of $143.2 for pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by a use of cash of $78.2 for pension contributions. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $246.5. Inventory was a use of cash of $23.5 primarily due to the timing of helium purchases from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The reduction of payables and accrued liabilities of $234.8 includes $148.5 for payments associated with projects accounted for as capital leases and $52.5 of payments related to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. For the year ended 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $1,553.1. Income from continuing operations of $1,004.2 reflected the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $100.4. The other adjustments included a use of cash of $300.8 for pension contributions, partially offset by $178.2 of pension and other postretirement expense. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $207.8. The reduction of accrued liabilities of $130.3 includes $185.8 for payments made in relation to the 2012 business restructuring and cost reduction plans, including the settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract. These payments were partially offset by a $69.7 net increase to accrued liabilities for the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. For the year ended 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $1,765.1. Income from continuing operations of $999.2 reflected the noncash gain on the previously held equity interest in DA NanoMaterials of $85.9, the write-down of long-lived assets associated with restructuring and a customer bankruptcy of $80.2, and a noncash tax benefit of $58.3 recognized as a result of the second quarter Spanish tax ruling. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $100.1. The provision for the business restructuring and cost reduction plans resulted in an increase to accrued liabilities of $223.9, partially offset by a use of cash of $32.9 for payments made in relation to these plans. 33 Table of Contents Investing Activities For the year ended 30 September 2014, cash used for investing activities was $1,638.0, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment. For the year ended 30 September 2013, cash used for investing activities was $1,697.0, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment and acquisitions. For the year ended 30 September 2012, cash used for investing activities was $2,435.2, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment, acquisitions, and investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section below for additional detail. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2014 2013 2012 Additions to plant and equipment $1,684.2 $1,524.2 $1,521.0 Acquisitions, less cash acquired — 224.9 863.4 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates (2.0 ) (1.3 ) 175.4 Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $1,682.2 $1,747.8 $2,559.8 Capital lease expenditures (A) 202.4 234.9 212.2 Purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary (A) .5 14.0 6.3 Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $1,885.1 $1,996.7 $2,778.3 (A) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the payment for subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2014 totaled $1,682.2, compared to $1,747.8 in 2013. The decrease of $65.6 was primarily due to the acquisitions in 2013. Additions to plant and equipment are largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Spending in 2014 and 2013 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification in China, hydrogen to the global market, and renewable energy in the U.K. In 2013, we completed three acquisitions with an aggregate cash use, net of cash acquired, of $224.9. In the fourth quarter, we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in Guiyang, China. During the third quarter, we acquired EPCO, the largest independent U.S. producer of liquid carbon dioxide (CO2), and WCG. In 2012, we acquired a controlling stake in Indura S.A. for $690 and E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc.’s 50% interest in our joint venture, DA NanoMaterials for $147. We also purchased a 25% equity interest in Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases & Equipment Co. Ltd. (AHG), an unconsolidated affiliate, for $155. Refer to Note 5, Business Combinations, and Note 7, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisitions and the investments. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2014 totaled $1,885.1 compared to $1,996.7 in 2013. Capital lease expenditures of $202.4 decreased by $32.5, reflecting lower project spending. 2015 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2015 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,650 and $1,800, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,700 and $1,900. The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases, which are expected to be between $50 and $100. A majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. Financing Activities For the year ended 2014, cash used by financing activities was $504.3 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $627.7, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $141.6. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $1.1 and included $148.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances, debt proceeds from the issuance of a 34 Table of Contents $400 senior fixed-rate 3.35% note on 31 July 2014 and $61.0 of other, primarily international, debt issuances and debt repayments of a 3.75% Eurobond of €300 million ($401.0) in November 2013 and $207.6 of other, primarily international, debt. For the year ended 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $115.4. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $927.4 and included $437.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and the issuances of a €300 million ($397) 2.0% Eurobond on 7 August 2013, and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 2.75% note on 4 February 2013, which were partially offset by the repayment of a $300.0 senior fixed-rate 4.15% note on 1 February 2013. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash of $226.4. The primary uses of cash were to purchase 5.7 million shares of treasury stock for $461.6 and to pay dividends of $565.6. For the year ended 2012, cash used for financing activities was $78.4. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $419.6 and included the issuances of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.0% note on 3 November 2011 and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 1.2% note on 13 September 2012, which were partially offset by the repayment of a 4.25% Eurobond of $400.3 on 10 April 2012. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided an additional $124.3 source of funds. Dividends paid to shareholders were a use of cash of $514.9. Discontinued Operations For the year ended 2014, cash used by discontinued operations was $146.6 and primarily included a payment made to The Linde Group for contingent proceeds we were obligated to return from the sale of our Homecare business. For the year ended 2013, cash provided by discontinued operations was $13.1. For the year ended 2012, the sale of our European Homecare business to The Linde Group generated proceeds of $776.6 and included the contingent proceeds that we returned in 2014. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2014 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2014, total debt outstanding was $6,118.5 compared to $6,273.6 at the end of 2013, and cash and cash items were $336.6 compared to $450.4 at the end of 2013. Total debt at 30 September 2014 and 2013, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest), was 43.9% and 45.3%, respectively. Proceeds from long-term debt were $461.0. This included the issuance of a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 3.35% note on 31 July 2014 that matures on 31 July 2024, which was issued for general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. During fiscal 2013, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement maturing 30 April 2018 with a syndicate of banks (the “2013 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. Effective 30 June 2014, the 2013 Credit Agreement was amended to increase the facility to $2,595.0. The 2013 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. This credit facility includes a financial covenant for a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest) no greater than 70%. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2014. Effective 11 June 2012, we entered into an offshore Chinese Renminbi (RMB) syndicated credit facility of RMB1,000.0 million ($160.9) that was to mature in June 2015. On 20 March 2014, we repaid the outstanding balance of RMB250.0 million ($40.2) and terminated the credit facility. Additional commitments totaling $189.7 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $180.6 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2014. As of 30 September 2014, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. As of 30 September 2014, we classified our 3.875% Eurobond of €300 million ($378.9) maturing in March 2015 as long-term debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under the 2013 Credit Agreement. Our current intent is to refinance this debt via the U.S. or European public or private placement markets. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. During fiscal year 2013, 5.7 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of $461.6. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal year 2014. At 30 September 2014, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains. 35 Table of Contents 2015 Outlook Cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2015, primarily to refinance maturing long-term debt. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. Dividends Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. During 2014, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from $.71 per share to $.77 per share. On 17 July 2014, the Board of Directors declared the fourth quarter dividend which is payable on 10 November 2014 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 1 October 2014. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2014: Payments Due by Period Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $4,890 $444 $411 $425 $449 $423 $2,738 Contractual interest 689 124 114 94 78 77 202 Capital leases 4 1 1 1 — — 1 Operating leases 315 70 48 34 27 19 117 Pension obligations 624 130 90 100 100 100 104 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,548 929 154 81 65 63 256 Total Contractual Obligations $8,070 $1,698 $818 $735 $719 $682 $3,418 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 14, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $1,168 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2014, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2014. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 11, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Approximately $650 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these 36 Table of Contents purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $700 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2015. We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2014 were $995.5. Tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2014 were $108.7. These tax liabilities were excluded from the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Put Options We have an outstanding put option agreement with the largest minority shareholder of our Indura S.A. subsidiary. The put option gives the shareholder the ability to require us to purchase up to a 30.5% equity interest during the two-year period beginning on 1 July 2015 based on pricing terms in the agreement. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We anticipate that this option will be exercised sometime during the two-year period; however given the uncertainty in timing of exercise; we have excluded the payment from the Contractual Obligations table. As of 30 September 2014, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is $287.2. PENSION BENEFITS We sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans—the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. For 2014, the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $4,114.6 from $3,800.8 in 2013. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $4,738.6 and $4,394.0 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Refer to Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2014 2013 2012 Pension expense $135.9 $169.7 $120.4 Special terminations and settlements (included above) 5.8 19.8 8.2 Weighted average discount rate 4.6 % 4.0 % 5.0 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 7.7 % 7.7 % 8.0 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 3.9 % 3.8 % 3.9 % 2014 vs. 2013 The decrease in pension expense, excluding special items, was primarily attributable to the 60 bp increase in weighted average discount rate, resulting in lower amortization of actuarial losses. The decrease was partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality assumptions. Special items of $5.8 primarily included $5.5 for pension settlement losses and $.3 for special termination benefits, a portion of which relates to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. 2013 vs. 2012 The increase in pension expense, excluding special items, was primarily attributable to the 100 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset 37 Table of Contents by a higher than expected return on plan assets and contributions in 2013. Special items of $19.8 primarily included $12.4 for pension settlement losses and $6.9 for special termination benefits relating to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. 2015 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $110 to $115, excluding special items, in 2015, a decrease of $15 to $20 from 2014, resulting primarily from favorable asset experience, partially offset by a decrease in discount rates. Pension settlement losses of $25 to $35 are expected, dependent on the timing of retirements. In 2015, we expect pension expense to include approximately $123 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $114 in 2014. Net actuarial losses of $104 were recognized in 2014, resulting primarily from an approximately 60 bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate, partially offset by actual asset returns above expected returns. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2015. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2014 and 2013, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $78.2 and $300.8, respectively. Contributions for 2013 included voluntary contributions for U.S. plans of $220.0. For 2015, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $130 to $150. The increase from prior year is driven primarily by benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements and actions to reorganize the business. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 36 for a projection of future contributions. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $35.1, $37.1, and $44.7 in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $5 and $4 in 2014 and 2013, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $5 in both 2015 and 2016. We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $86 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $99 as of 30 September 2014. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2014 and 2013 included an accrual of $86.2 and $86.7, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; Paulsboro, New Jersey; and Pasadena, Texas, locations is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. 38 Table of Contents Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and California’s cap and trade scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada, and South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. At the U.S. state level, California’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted, and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began 1 January 2013. We have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. We did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm’s length with clearly independent parties. INFLATION We operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2014 totaled $9,532.1, and depreciation expense totaled $914.8 during 2014. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. 39 Table of Contents Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. We have numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Additionally, we have several customer supply contracts within the Equipment and Energy segment with contract terms that are primarily five to 10 years. The depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to 20 years for certain redeployable assets. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the physical life of the asset. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease LifeBy 1 Year Increase LifeBy 1 Year Merchant Gases $32 $(24 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $12 $(11 ) Impairment of Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing 40 Table of Contents impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. We tested the recoverability of Latin America long-lived assets and concluded that they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $1,237.3 as of 30 September 2014. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 9, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements. We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. As of 30 September 2014, we had four business segments and thirteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a two-step quantitative test is required. We chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing, as further described below. The first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value, including assigned goodwill. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in an analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. We conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. Other than our Latin America reporting unit within the Merchant Gases segment, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The Latin America reporting unit is composed predominately of our Indura business, with assets and goodwill associated with operations in Chile and other Latin American countries. Recently, economic conditions in Latin America, including 41 Table of Contents the impact of tax legislation in Chile, have been less favorable due to increasing inflation, a decline in Chilean manufacturing growth, and weaker export demand for many commodities. As a result, we lowered growth projections for our Latin America reporting unit and determined that the associated goodwill was impaired. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $305.2. Refer to Note 9, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other than Latin America, the excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units ranged from approximately 35% to approximately 175%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of these reporting units. In this scenario, the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 20% to 150%. Due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 October 2014, we conducted an additional impairment test on our existing reporting units as of 30 September 2014. The fair value of all of our reporting units except Latin America substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 September 2014. The fair value of the Latin America reporting unit at 30 September was estimated based on a similar outlook and assumptions as those used for the 1 July 2014 testing, and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value due primarily to depreciation and amortization and the impact of the Chilean tax rate change. As of 30 September 2014, the carrying value of Latin America goodwill was $232.7. If economic conditions in the Latin America operating environment deteriorate further or the business fails to perform as expected, an additional review of goodwill recoverability may be warranted. Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in additional impairment charges. We will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results or changes in management’s business outlook or strategy. We will conduct goodwill impairment testing in the first quarter of 2015 under our new reporting structure. Intangible Assets Intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 September 2014 totaled $541.2 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2014 totaled $74.6 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we conducted our annual impairment test and determined that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. Refer to Note 10, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,257.9 at 30 September 2014. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 7, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is 42 Table of Contents based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2014, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $78.0 and $806.1, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2014 were $108.7, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2014 was $366.0. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $14. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. Our mortality assumptions are currently aligned with the IRS mortality assumption used to determine funding valuations. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries published new mortality tables. While the IRS is not expected to adopt the new tables until 2017, we have begun to evaluate the potential impact of these tables on future periods. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. This rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $21 per year. 43 Table of Contents The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $17 per year. We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for fixed income investments is the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets. The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $5 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded. 44 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about earnings guidance and business outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, weakening or reversal of global or regional economic recovery; future financial and operating performance of major customers; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; the impact of competitive products and pricing; unexpected changes in raw material supply and markets; unanticipated asset impairments or losses; the impact of price fluctuations in natural gas; the ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory investigations; the impact of management and organizational changes, including pension settlement and other associated costs; the success of cost reduction efforts; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; political risks, including the risks of unanticipated government actions that may result in project delays, cancellations or expropriations; the impact of changes in environmental, tax or other legislation and regulations in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; the impact on the effective tax rate of changes in the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations; and other risk factors described in Section 1A, Risk Factors. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 12, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases. Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in Note 13, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. At 30 September 2014 and 2013, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $5,044.9 and $5,719.5, respectively. The decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to repayment of a 3.75% Eurobond of €300 million ($401.0) in November 2013 and a stronger U.S. dollar which reduced the translated value of foreign currency debt. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date. 45 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2014, including the effect of currency swap agreements, primarily comprised debt denominated in U.S. dollars (54%) and Euros (22%). This debt portfolio is composed of 50% fixed-rate debt and 50% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position. The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2014, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $173 and $143 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2014 and 2013, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $188 and $154 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2014 and 2013, respectively. Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $31 and $29 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2014 and 2013, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $31 and $29 per year at 30 September 2014 and 2013, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2014 and 2013, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $419 and $295 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in the sensitivity analysis from September 2013 to September 2014 is driven primarily by an increase in the notional amount of intercompany loan currency hedges. The primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and the Euro versus the Pound Sterling. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. The majority of the Company’s sales are derived from outside of the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. Financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Euro represents the largest exposure in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in the Euro versus the U.S. dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $20. 46 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:33.394858

BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. is a world-leading Industrial Gases company celebrating 75 years of operation. The Company’s core Industrial Gases business provides atmospheric and process gases and related equipment to manufacturing markets, including refining and petrochemical, metals, electronics, and food and beverage. Air Products is also the world’s leading supplier of liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment. The Company’s Materials Technologies business serves the semiconductor, polyurethanes, cleaning and coatings, and adhesives industries. With operations in over 50 countries, in 2015 we had sales of $9.9 billion, assets of $17.4 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 19,700 employees. Effective 1 October 2014, we began operating under a new organizational structure that is aligned with the regional nature of the industrial gases business. We began reporting our results under the following seven new segments: Industrial Gases – Americas, Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Industrial Gases – Asia, Industrial Gases – Global, Materials Technologies, Energy-from-Waste, and Corporate and other. The financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on these operations. Prior year segment information has been restated to conform with the fiscal year 2015 presentation. Refer to Note 26, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments and segment reorganization beginning in fiscal year 2015. 22 Table of Contents 2015 IN SUMMARY In 2015, we made significant progress in focusing on our core industrial gases business, we reorganized the Company into a more decentralized structure, including realignment of our businesses into new reporting segments, and announced our intention to spin-off the Materials Technologies business by September 2016. We also began changing our culture, improved our focus on safety, implemented a more rigorous capital review process, delivered on our cost reduction targets, and aligned employee rewards to performance at the business unit level. These changes drove increased profitability as we delivered earnings per share growth of 28% and increased operating margin by 450 basis points (bp) to 17.2%, despite significant unfavorable currency impacts. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share growth increased 14% and operating margin increased by 310 bp to 19.0%. Highlights for 2015 • Sales of $9,894.9 decreased 5%, or $544.1. Underlying sales growth of 3% was more than offset by unfavorable currency and lower energy contractual cost pass-through to customers. Sales increased 2% from higher volumes in Industrial Gases – Asia and Materials Technologies and 1% from improved pricing in Industrial Gases – Americas and Materials Technologies. • Operating income of $1,699.1 increased 28%, or $370.9. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,884.0 increased 14%, or $227.5, with higher volumes, favorable price, and lower costs driven by restructuring, partially offset by unfavorable currency. • Adjusted EBITDA of $2,974.9 increased 8%, or $210.1, primarily due to higher volumes, higher pricing, and favorable cost performance. • Income from continuing operations of $1,277.9 increased 29%, or $290.8, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.88 increased 28%, or $1.29. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,427.0 increased 15%, or $184.0, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.57 increased 14%, or $.79. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share, including a non-GAAP reconciliation, is presented below. • We increased our quarterly dividend by 5% from $.77 to $.81 per share. This represents the 33rd consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to our 2016 Outlook below. 23 Table of Contents Changes in Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to Air Products 2015 2014 Increase(Decrease) Diluted Earnings per Share Net income $5.88 $4.61 $1.27 Income (Loss) from discontinued operations — .02 (.02 ) Income from Continuing Operations—GAAP Basis $5.88 $4.59 $1.29 Business restructuring and cost reduction actions .71 .04 .67 Pension settlement loss .06 .02 .04 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge — 1.27 (1.27 ) Business separation costs .03 — .03 Gain on previously held equity interest (.05 ) — (.05 ) Gain on land sales (.13 ) — (.13 ) Loss on early retirement of debt .07 — .07 Chilean tax rate change — .10 (.10 ) Tax election benefit — (.24 ) .24 Income from Continuing Operations—Non-GAAP Basis $6.57 $5.78 $.79 Operating income (after-tax) Underlying business Volume .50 Price/raw materials .37 Costs/other .33 Currency (.41 ) Operating Income .79 Other (after-tax) Equity affiliates’ income .01 Interest expense .08 Income tax rate (.01 ) Noncontrolling interests (.02 ) Average shares outstanding (.06 ) Total Change in Diluted Earnings per Share from ContinuingOperations—Non-GAAP Basis $.79 2016 OUTLOOK For 2016, we intend to remain focused on key actions we can control to continue to improve cash flow and drive earnings growth. We intend to accomplish this by bringing new projects on-stream, realizing full year benefits of our fiscal year 2015 cost reduction actions, and continued operational improvement actions. We expect overall economic growth to be modest in 2016, which may limit opportunities for underlying growth. Additionally, we expect lower LNG results due to delays in customer investment decisions. We expect to complete the separation of our Materials Technologies segment via a spin-off into a standalone company to be distributed to shareholders by September 2016. The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” 24 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2015 2014 2013 Sales $9,894.9 $10,439.0 $10,180.4 Operating income—GAAP Basis 1,699.1 1,328.2 1,324.4 Operating margin—GAAP Basis 17.2% 12.7% 13.0% Equity affiliates’ income 154.5 151.4 167.8 Non-GAAP Basis Adjusted EBITDA 2,974.9 2,764.8 2,640.9 Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.1% 26.5% 25.9% Operating income 1,884.0 1,656.5 1,566.1 Operating margin 19.0% 15.9% 15.4% Sales % Change from Prior Year 2015 2014 Underlying business Volume 2% 2% Price 1% —% Energy and raw material cost pass-through (3)% 1% Currency (5)% —% Total Consolidated Change (5)% 3% 2015 vs. 2014 Sales of $9,894.9 decreased 5%, or $544.1. Underlying sales were up 3% from higher volumes of 2% and higher pricing of 1%. Volumes increased primarily from new plant on-streams in Industrial Gases – Asia and growth in Materials Technologies. The favorable pricing was primarily driven by price increases in the Industrial Gases – Americas and Materials Technologies segments. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 5% and lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers decreased sales by 3%. 2014 vs. 2013 Sales of $10,439.0 increased 3%, or $258.6. Underlying business increased 2%, primarily due to higher volumes in the Materials Technologies and Industrial Gases – Americas segments, partially offset by the exit of our polyurethane intermediates (PUI) business which reduced sales by 1%. Higher energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 1%. Currency was flat as the impacts from a stronger Euro were offset by a weaker Chilean Peso. Operating Income and Margin 2015 vs. 2014 On a GAAP basis, operating income of $1,699.1 increased 28%, or $370.9. Current year operating income included a charge for business reorganization and cost reduction actions of $207.7, a pension settlement loss of $21.2, business separation costs of $7.5, gain on land sales of $33.6, and a gain of $17.9 on revaluing a previously held equity interest upon purchase of our partner’s shares. Prior year operating income included a goodwill and intangible asset charge of $310.1, a business restructuring and cost reduction charge of $12.7, and a pension settlement loss of $5.5. Operating margin of 17.2% increased 450 bp. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,884.0 increased 14%, or $227.5. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes of $144, favorable pricing net of energy and fuel costs of $105, and favorable cost performance across most segments of $94, partially offset by unfavorable currency of $115. Costs were lower as benefits from our cost reduction actions of approximately $170 and lower maintenance expense of $33 were offset by higher incentive compensation of approximately $100 due to improved results. Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.0% increased 310 bp due to favorable costs, higher volumes, and higher pricing. 25 Table of Contents 2014 vs. 2013 On a GAAP basis, operating income of $1,328.2 increased $3.8. Operating income in 2014 was reduced by $310.1 for a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, $12.7 for a business reorganization and cost reduction charge, and $5.5 for pension settlement losses. Operating income in 2013 was reduced by a charge of $231.6 for a business restructuring and cost reduction charge and $10.1 for advisory costs. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,656.5 increased 6%, or $90.4. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher volumes of $140, partially offset by lower recovery of raw material costs in pricing of $29 and higher operating costs of $9. Operating income in 2013 included $10 for gains from the sale of assets and investments. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance. 2015 vs. 2014 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,974.9 increased $210.1, or 8%, due to higher volumes, higher pricing, and favorable costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.1% increased 360 bp. 2014 vs. 2013 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,764.8 increased $123.9, or 5%, primarily due to the increase in volumes. Equity Affiliates’ Income 2015 vs. 2014 Income from equity affiliates of $154.5 increased $3.1, primarily due to higher volumes and favorable cost performance in our Industrial Gases – Asia and Industrial Gases – Americas affiliates. 2014 vs. 2013 Income from equity affiliates of $151.4 decreased $16.4, due to higher costs from maintenance outages and an unfavorable arbitration award, unfavorable currency impacts, and weaker oil field services volume in Mexico. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 2015 vs. 2014 Cost of sales of $6,944.1 decreased $690.5, or 9%, primarily due to a favorable currency impact of $368, lower energy costs of $313, and lower operating costs of $102, partially offset by costs attributable to higher sales volumes of $92. Operating costs included favorable impacts from cost reduction actions of $48 and lower other costs, including maintenance, of $115, partially offset by higher incentive compensation of $61. Gross margin of 29.8% increased 290 bp, primarily due to lower costs of 120 bp, higher price, net of raw materials, of 100 bp, and higher volumes of 80 bp. 2014 vs. 2013 Cost of sales of $7,634.6 increased $162.5, primarily due to higher energy costs of $104, higher operating costs, including maintenance, of $72, and an unfavorable currency impact of $24, partially offset by favorable volume mix of $37. Gross margin of 26.9% increased 30 bp, primarily due to favorable volume mix of 100 bp and higher price, net of raw materials, of 20 bp, partially offset by higher operating costs of 90 bp. Selling and Administrative Expense 2015 vs. 2014 Selling and administrative expense of $941.7 decreased $117.6, or 11%, primarily due to the benefits of our cost reduction actions of $122 and favorable currency effects of $62, partially offset by higher costs of $66, driven by higher incentive compensation. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 9.5% from 10.1%. 2014 vs. 2013 Selling and administrative expense of $1,059.3 decreased $7.0, or 1%, as productivity, including the benefits of recent cost reduction actions, and favorable currency effects more than offset other cost increases. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 10.1% from 10.5%. 26 Table of Contents Research and Development 2015 vs. 2014 Research and development expense of $138.8 decreased $2.6, or 2%. Fiscal year 2015 and 2014 research and development expense as a percent of sales was 1.4%. 2014 vs. 2013 Research and development expense of $141.4 increased $7.7, or 6%, primarily due to lower government grants and other cost increases. Research and development expense as a percent of sales increased to 1.4% from 1.3%. Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions We recorded charges in 2015, 2014, and 2013 for business restructuring and cost reduction actions. The charges for these actions are excluded from segment operating income. Business Realignment and Reorganization On 18 September 2014, we announced plans to reorganize the Company, including realignment of our businesses in new reporting segments and other organizational changes, effective as of 1 October 2014, which resulted in the largest transformational change in the history of the Company. As a result of this reorganization, we have incurred ongoing severance and other charges. In fiscal year 2015, we recognized an expense of $207.7 ($153.2 after-tax, or $.71 per share). Severance and other benefits totaled $151.9 and related to the elimination of approximately 2,000 positions. Asset and associated contract actions totaled $55.8 and related primarily to a plant shutdown in the Corporate and other segment and the exit of product lines within the Industrial Gases – Global and Materials Technologies segments. During the fourth quarter of 2014, an expense of $12.7 ($8.2 after-tax, or $.04 per share) was incurred relating to the elimination of approximately 50 positions. 2013 Plan During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an expense of $231.6 ($157.9 after-tax, or $.74 per share) reflecting actions to better align our cost structure with current market conditions. The charge included asset and contract actions that primarily related to the Electronics Materials business due to continued weakness in the photovoltaic (PV) and light-emitting diode (LED) markets. In addition, the charge included severance, benefits, and other contractual obligations primarily related to our Industrial Gases businesses and corporate functions in response to weaker than expected conditions in Europe and Asia, reorganization of our operations and functional areas, and senior executive changes. Refer to Note 5, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions. Pension Settlement Loss Certain of our pension plans provide for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the retirement date. Pension settlements are immediately recognized when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. The participant’s vested benefit is considered fully settled upon cash payment of the lump sum. We recognized $21.2 ($13.7 after-tax, or $.06 per share), $5.5 ($3.6 after-tax, or $.02 per share) and $12.4 ($7.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share) of settlement charges in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, to accelerate recognition of a portion of actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily related to our U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charge In July 2012, we acquired a controlling interest in the outstanding shares of Indura S.A., a Latin American industrial gases company. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $626.2 of goodwill, which is incorporated into the Latin American reporting unit of our Industrial Gases – Americas segment. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily acquired trade names) associated with this reporting unit were impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of $310.1 ($275.1 attributable to Air Products after-tax, or $1.27 per share). Refer to the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below for additional details. 27 Table of Contents Business Separation Costs On 16 September 2015, the Company announced that it intends to separate its Materials Technologies business via a spin-off. During the fourth quarter, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $7.5 ($.03 per share). Gain on Previously Held Equity Interest On 30 December 2014, we acquired our partner’s equity ownership interest in a liquefied atmospheric industrial gases production joint venture in North America for $22.6 which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and subsequent to the acquisition, the results are consolidated within our Industrial Gases – Americas segment. The assets acquired, primarily plant and equipment, were recorded at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The acquisition date fair value of the previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis under the income approach. During the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a gain of $17.9 ($11.2 after-tax, or $.05 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair value as of the acquisition date. Advisory Costs During the fourth quarter of 2013, we incurred legal and other advisory fees of $10.1 ($6.4 after-tax, or $.03 per share) in connection with our response to the rapid acquisition of a large position in shares of our common stock by Pershing Square Capital Management LLC and its affiliates. Other Income (Expense), Net Items recorded to other income (expense), net arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income (expense), net is presented in Note 24, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2015 vs. 2014 Other income (expense), net of $47.3 decreased $5.5. The current year includes a gain of $33.6 ($28.3 after-tax, or $.13 per share) resulting from the sale of two parcels of land. The gain was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and lower gains on other sales of assets and emissions credits. No other individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2014 vs. 2013 Other income (expense), net of $52.8 decreased $17.4, primarily due to higher gains from the sale of a number of small assets and investments, higher government grants, and a favorable commercial contract settlement in 2013. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to 2013. Interest Expense 2015 2014 2013 Interest incurred $152.6 $158.1 $167.6 Less: Capitalized interest 49.1 33.0 25.8 Interest Expense $103.5 $125.1 $141.8 2015 vs. 2014 Interest incurred decreased $5.5. The decrease was driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest of $12, partially offset by a higher average debt balance of $7. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a higher carrying value in construction in progress. 2014 vs. 2013 Interest incurred decreased $9.5. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average interest rate on the debt portfolio which reduced interest by $13, partially offset by a higher average debt balance which increased interest by $6. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a higher carrying value in construction in progress. Loss on early retirement of debt In September 2015, we made a payment of $146.6 to redeem 3,000,000 Unidades de Fomento (“UF”) Series E 6.30% Bonds due 22 January 2030 that had a carrying value of $130.0 and resulted in a net loss of $16.6 ($14.2 after-tax, or $.07 per share). 28 Table of Contents Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2015 vs. 2014 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.0% and 27.0% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher in the prior year primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $305.2, which was not deductible for tax purposes, and the Chilean tax reform enacted in September 2014 which increased income tax expense by $20.6. These impacts were partially offset by an income tax benefit of $51.6 associated with losses from transactions and a tax election in a non-U.S. subsidiary. Refer to Note 10, Goodwill, and Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% and 24.0% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 2014 vs. 2013 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 27.0% and 22.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. As discussed above, the effective tax rate was higher in 2014 primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge and the Chilean tax rate change, which were partially offset by a tax benefit associated with losses from transactions and a tax election in a non-U.S. subsidiary. The 2013 rate included income tax benefits of $73.7 related to the business restructuring and cost reduction plan and $3.7 for the advisory costs. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.0% and 24.2% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Discontinued Operations During the second quarter of 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of our Homecare business, which has been accounted for as a discontinued operation. In 2012, we sold the majority of our Homecare business to The Linde Group and recognized a gain of $207.4. In addition, an impairment charge of $33.5 was recorded to write down the remaining business, which was primarily in the United Kingdom and Ireland, to its estimated net realizable value. In 2013, we recorded an additional charge of $18.7 to update our estimate of the net realizable value. In 2014, a gain of $3.9 was recognized for the sale of the remaining Homecare business and settlement of contingencies on the sale to The Linde Group.

Energy-from-Waste 2015 2014 2013 Operating loss $(10.1 ) $(12.4 ) $(9.8 ) Adjusted EBITDA (10.1 ) (12.4 ) (9.8 ) The Energy-from-Waste segment consists of two projects that are under construction in Tees Valley, United Kingdom. These projects are designed to process municipal solid waste to generate renewable power for customers under long-term contracts. Costs being expensed during project construction include land leases and commercial management. Despite technical challenges and on-stream delays, the Company remains focused on efforts to bring the first project on-stream. In November 2015, the Company suspended construction of the second project until certain design issues of the first project are understood, remediated, and can be efficiently integrated into the design of the second project. We are evaluating the incremental costs associated with idling the project, including the impact on capitalized interest. Future actions and assessments could impact the disposition of the investment. Corporate and other 2015 2014 2013 Sales $324.7 $322.2 $418.3 Operating loss (50.6 ) (77.0 ) (84.3 ) Adjusted EBITDA (37.6 ) (66.2 ) (77.8 ) 2015 vs. 2014 Sales of $324.7 increased $2.5, or 1%, primarily due to higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) project activity, mostly offset by lower helium container sales and the impact of exiting our PUI business which was completed as of the end of the first quarter of 2014.

The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which management uses internally to evaluate our operating performance. We use non-GAAP measures to assess our operating performance by excluding certain disclosed items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business. We believe non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with meaningful information to understand our underlying operating results and to analyze financial and business trends. Non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, should not be viewed in isolation, are not a substitute for GAAP measures, and have limitations which include but are not limited to: • Our measure excludes certain disclosed items, which we do not consider to be representative of underlying business operations. However, these disclosed items represent costs (benefits) to the Company. • Though not business operating costs, interest expense and income tax provision represent ongoing costs of the Company. • Depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges represent the wear and tear and/or reduction in value of the plant, equipment, and intangible assets which permit us to manufacture and/or market our products. • Other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. A reader may find any one or all of these items important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them only to supplement our GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. In evaluating these financial measures, the reader should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation in the future. In 2013, we had pension settlement losses of $12.4 ($7.8 after-tax, or $.04 per share). These impacts were included in the non-GAAP operating performance measures for fiscal year 2013.

We continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of 30 September 2015, we had $195.7 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $206.4. If the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the U.S. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the U.S. Current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds. Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2015 2014 2013 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $2,437.8 $2,186.4 $1,553.1 Investing activities (1,599.7 ) (1,638.0 ) (1,697.0 ) Financing activities (945.4 ) (504.3 ) 115.4 Operating Activities For the year ended 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $2,437.8. Income from continuing operations of $1,277.9 reflected the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $47.4, a non-cash gain on the previously held equity interest of $17.9, and a loss on early retirement of debt of $16.6. Income from continuing operations is adjusted for reconciling items that include depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, undistributed earnings of equity affiliates, gains on sale of assets and investments, share-based compensation expense, and noncurrent capital lease receivables. Other adjustments included pension and postretirement expense of $141.4 and contributions to our pension plans of $137.5, primarily for plans in the U.S. and U.K. Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including tax, cash flow, and regulatory implications. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $218.8. The increase of payables and accrued liabilities of $157.8 includes an increase in accrued incentive compensation of $97.0. For the year ended 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $2,186.4. Income from continuing operations of $987.1 reflected the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $310.1. Other adjustments included $143.2 for pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by a use of cash of $78.2 for pension contributions. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $246.5. Inventory was a use of cash of $23.5 primarily due to the timing of helium purchases from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The reduction of payables and accrued liabilities of $234.8 includes $148.5 for payments associated with projects accounted for as capital leases and $52.5 of payments related to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. For the year ended 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $1,553.1. Income from continuing operations of $1,004.2 reflected the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $100.4. The other adjustments included a use of cash of $300.8 for pension contributions, partially offset by $178.2 of pension and other postretirement expense. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $207.8. The reduction of accrued liabilities of $130.3 includes $185.8 for payments made in relation to the 2012 business restructuring and cost reduction plans, including the settlement of a long-term take-or-pay silane contract. These payments were partially offset by a $69.7 net increase to accrued liabilities for the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. Investing Activities For the year ended 30 September 2015, cash used for investing activities was $1,599.7, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment. On 30 December 2014, we acquired our partner’s equity ownership interest in a liquefied industrial gases production joint venture in North America which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. Refer to Note 6, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. For the year ended 30 September 2014, cash used for investing activities was $1,638.0, primarily 39 Table of Contents capital expenditures for plant and equipment. For the year ended 30 September 2013, cash used for investing activities was $1,697.0, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment and acquisitions. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section below for additional detail. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2015 2014 2013 Additions to plant and equipment $1,614.8 $1,684.2 $1,524.2 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 34.5 — 224.9 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 4.3 (2.0 ) (1.3 ) Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $1,653.6 $1,682.2 $1,747.8 Capital lease expenditures (A) 95.6 202.4 234.9 Purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary(A) 278.4 .5 14.0 Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $2,027.6 $1,885.1 $1,996.7 (A) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests is accounted for as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2015 totaled $1,653.6, compared to $1,682.2 in 2014. The decrease of $28.6 was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar which reduced the value of foreign currency capital expenditures, partially offset by acquisitions in 2015. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Spending in 2015 and 2014 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification in China, hydrogen to the global market, and renewable energy in the U.K. In 2013, we completed three acquisitions with an aggregate cash use, net of cash acquired, of $224.9. In the fourth quarter, we acquired an air separation unit and integrated gases liquefier in Guiyang, China. During the third quarter, we acquired EPCO Carbondioxide Products, Inc, the largest independent U.S. producer of liquid carbon dioxide, and Wuxi Chem-Gas Company, Ltd. Refer to Note 6, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisitions. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2015 totaled $2,027.6 compared to $1,885.1 in 2014. This increase was primarily due to the purchase of the 30.5% equity interest in our Indura S.A. subsidiary from the largest minority shareholder for $277.9. Refer to Note 21, Noncontrolling Interests, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Additionally, capital lease expenditures of $95.6 decreased by $106.8, reflecting lower project spending. On 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture and expects to invest approximately $100. Air Products has also entered into a sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer, procure, and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply the gases to Saudi Aramco. Sales backlog represents our estimate of revenue to be recognized in the future on sale of equipment orders and related process technology that are under firm contracts. The sales backlog for the Company at 30 September 2015 was $1,931, compared to $520 at 30 September 2014. The increase in the sales backlog includes a new contract with one of our joint ventures in Saudi Arabia for the construction of an industrial gas facility that will supply gases to Saudi Aramco. 2016 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2016 are expected to be between $1,500 and $1,600. A majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. 40 Table of Contents Financing Activities For the year ended 2015, cash used for financing activities was $945.4 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $677.5 and payments for subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interest of $278.4, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $121.3. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net use of cash (repayment) of $85.9 and included $284.0 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances, debt proceeds from the issuance of a 1.0% Eurobond of €300 million ($335.3), repayment of a 3.875% Eurobond of €300 million ($335.9), repayment of Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling $147.2, and repayment of 3,000,000 Unidades de Fomento (“UF”) Series E 6.30% Bonds totaling $146.6. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. For the year ended 2014, cash used for financing activities was $504.3 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $627.7, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $141.6. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $1.1 and included $148.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances, debt proceeds from the issuance of a $400 senior fixed-rate 3.35% note on 31 July 2014 and $61.0 of other, primarily international, debt issuances and debt repayments of a 3.75% Eurobond of €300 million ($401.0) in November 2013 and $207.6 of other, primarily international, debt. For the year ended 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $115.4. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $927.4 and included $437.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances and the issuances of a €300 million ($397) 2.0% Eurobond on 7 August 2013, and a $400.0 senior fixed-rate 2.75% note on 4 February 2013, which were partially offset by the repayment of a $300.0 senior fixed-rate 4.15% note on 1 February 2013. Proceeds from stock option exercises provided cash of $226.4. The primary uses of cash were to purchase 5.7 million shares of treasury stock for $461.6 and to pay dividends of $565.6. Discontinued Operations For the year ended 2015, there were no discontinued operations. For the year ended 2014, cash used for discontinued operations was $146.6 and primarily included a payment made to the Linde Group for contingent proceeds we were obligated to return from the sale of our Homecare business. For the year ended 2013, cash provided by discontinued operations was $13.1. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2015 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2015, total debt outstanding was $5,879.0 compared to $6,118.5 at the end of 2014, and cash and cash items were $206.4 compared to $336.6 at the end of 2014. Total debt at 30 September 2015 and 2014, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest), was 44.3% and 43.9%, respectively. During fiscal 2013, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement maturing 30 April 2018 with a syndicate of banks (the “2013 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. There have been subsequent amendments to the 2013 Credit Agreement, and as of 30 September 2015, the maximum borrowing capacity was $2,690.0. The 2013 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. This credit facility includes a financial covenant for a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (total debt plus total equity plus redeemable noncontrolling interest) no greater than 70%. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2015. Commitments totaling $119.4 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $110.6 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2015. As of 30 September 2015, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. During fiscal year 2013, 5.7 million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of $461.6. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2015 and 2014. At 30 September 2015, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains. 41 Table of Contents 2016 Outlook Cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We project a modest need to access the long-term debt markets in 2016, primarily to refinance maturing long-term debt. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. Also, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. At 30 September, our working capital balance was ($737), primarily due to $1,929.9 of short-term borrowings and long-term debt due within the next 12 months. Maintaining the short-term borrowings balance at its current level provides flexibility in how we manage cash flows associated with the anticipated spin-off of our Materials Technologies business in 2016. Dividends Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. During 2015, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from $.77 per share to $.81 per share. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2015: Payments Due by Period Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $4,385 $436 $373 $428 $415 $361 $2,372 Contractual interest 501 102 84 70 69 50 126 Capital leases 3 1 1 — — — 1 Operating leases 367 66 54 46 36 27 138 Pension obligations 871 100 85 85 90 45 466 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,370 917 117 63 55 54 164 Obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate 100 — — — — 100 — Total Contractual Obligations $7,597 $1,622 $714 $692 $665 $637 $3,267 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $929 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2015, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2015. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. 42 Table of Contents Unconditional Purchase Obligations Approximately $390 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $540 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2016. We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. Obligation for Future Contribution to an Equity Affiliate On 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan. In total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. As of 30 September 2015, we recorded a noncurrent liability of $67.5 for our obligation to make future equity contributions based on advances received by the joint venture under the loan. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2015 were $903.3. Tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2015 were $97.5. These tax liabilities were excluded from the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. PENSION BENEFITS The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans—the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan—were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. The fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2015 measurement date decreased to $3,916.4 from $4,114.6 at the end of fiscal year 2014. The projected benefit obligation for these plans was $4,787.8 and $4,738.6 at the end of the fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2015 2014 2013 Pension expense $135.6 $135.9 $169.7 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 35.2 5.8 19.8 Weighted average discount rate 4.0 % 4.6 % 4.0 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 7.4 % 7.7 % 7.7 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 3.5 % 3.9 % 3.8 % 43 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 Pension expense, excluding special items, decreased from the prior year due to the impact from expected return on assets, a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption, and lower service cost and interest cost. This was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses, which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate. Special items of $35.2 included pension settlement losses of $21.2, special termination benefits of $8.7, and curtailment losses of $5.3. These resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions. 2014 vs. 2013 The decrease in pension expense, excluding special items, was primarily attributable to the 60 bp increase in weighted average discount rate, which resulted in lower amortization of actuarial losses. The decrease was partially offset by unfavorable impacts associated with changes in mortality assumptions. Special items of $5.8 included $5.5 for pension settlement losses and $.3 for special termination benefits, a portion of which relates to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. 2016 Outlook In 2016, we will change the method utilized to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for our major defined benefit pension plans. Historically, we estimated the service cost and interest cost components using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We will elect to use a spot rate approach for our major plans in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs. We consider this a change in estimate and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligation. In 2015, we adopted the Society of Actuaries new mortality tables for the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan when we re-measured the plan due to pension settlements and curtailment. In 2016, we will adopt the new mortality tables for all major plans. In 2016, pension expense is estimated to be approximately $80 to $100, excluding special items, which would be flat to down versus 2015 and results from a reduction of the service cost and interest cost from adoption of the spot rate approach defined above and the impact of the expected return on plan assets, partially offset by adoption of the new mortality tables. Pension settlement losses of $10 to $20 are expected, dependent on the timing of retirements. In 2016, we expect pension expense to include approximately $125 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $120 in 2015. Net actuarial losses of $431 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2015, primarily attributable to lower than expected actual returns on plan assets, improved mortality projections and lower discount rates. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2016. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2015 and 2014, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $137.5 and $78.2, respectively. For 2016, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $100 to $120. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements and future cost reduction actions. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 42 for a projection of future contributions. 44 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $28.3, $35.1, and $37.1 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $4 and $5 in 2015 and 2014, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $4 in both 2016 and 2017. We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $80 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $93 as of 30 September 2015. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2015 and 2014 included an accrual of $80.6 and $86.2, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and Pasadena, Texas, locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and California’s cap and trade scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in Ontario, Canada, China, and South Korea. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. At the U.S. state level, California’s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted, and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer began 1 January 2013. We have been able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. 45 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating in the industrial gas business. During the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a long-term sale of equipment contract to engineer, procure, and construct industrial gas facilities for our 25% owned joint venture to serve Saudi Aramco’s Jazan oil refinery and power plant in Saudi Arabia. The principal terms of the agreement are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party. Sales related to this contract are included in the results of our Industrial Gases – Global segment and were not material during fiscal year 2015. INFLATION We operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2015 totaled $9,636.9, and depreciation expense totaled $900.4 during 2015. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. The regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset. Our regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Materials Technologies segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives 46 Table of Contents have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional Industrial Gases segments and Materials Technologies segment would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease Life Increase Life By 1 Year By 1 Year Industrial Gases – Regional $38 $(33) Materials Technologies $4 $(3) Impairment of Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. In 2014, we tested the recoverability of Latin America long-lived assets and concluded they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows. In 2015, due to continued technical challenges, on-stream delays, and additional capital costs for the two projects associated with our Energy-from-Waste segment that are under construction in Tees Valley, United Kingdom, the Company evaluated different scenarios using undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine whether an indication of impairment exists. Factors specific to this asset grouping include estimating long-term efficiency, output, and on-stream reliability of the projects. The probability weighted undiscounted cash flows of the asset group exceeded the carrying value; therefore, no impairment was indicated. In November 2015, the Company suspended construction of the second project until certain design issues of the first project are understood, remediated, and can be efficiently integrated into the design of the second project. It is reasonably possible that key assumptions or actual conditions may change and result in a future impairment charge. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $1,131.3 as of 30 September 2015. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements. 47 Table of Contents We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for more frequent testing. As a result of our reorganization effective 1 October 2014, we also reviewed goodwill for impairment in the first quarter of 2015 as further discussed below. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. As of 30 September 2015, we had seven business segments and thirteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products within each business segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the three regional Industrial Gases segments and the Materials Technologies segment. As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a two-step quantitative test is required. We chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing, as further described below. The first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value, including assigned goodwill. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in an analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. In 2014, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing as of 1 July 2014 and concluded that the goodwill associated with the Latin America reporting unit, previously within the Merchant Gases segment, was impaired and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $305.2. The Latin America reporting unit is composed predominately of our Indura business with business units in Chile, Colombia, and other Latin America countries, which the Company acquired in 2012. The acquisition price in 2012 reflected the Company’s expectations for Indura’s revenue growth in Chile and across Latin America. At the time of the acquisition, the Indura business had approximately $480 in revenue and 21% EBITDA margin. We anticipated average revenue to grow at a multiple of up to two times long-term manufacturing growth, which was projected at approximately 4%. In addition, we expected additional revenue growth from the Company’s ability to fund increased on-site plant investment and its application technology capability. We also expected EBITDA margins to expand based on production, distribution, supply chain, and overhead synergies. Revenue growth was also anticipated to drive expanding EBITDA margins and increase future cash flows. 48 Table of Contents In 2014, economic conditions impacting our Latin America reporting unit began to weaken, including a decline in Chilean manufacturing growth, increasing inflation, weaker export demand for many commodities, and the enactment of higher tax rates in Chile. While we achieved expected cost synergies for the Indura business, we did not realize projected revenue growth primarily due to the weakening Chilean economy. Additionally, long-term manufacturing growth forecasts were reduced to 2% to 3% in Chile and other countries in which Indura operates. As a result of these events, we had lowered our growth projections to be in line with lower published growth rates, reduced our expectations for EBITDA margin expansion by approximately 600 basis points, and determined that the associated goodwill was impaired. In 2014, we conducted an additional impairment test on our reporting units that existed as of 30 September 2014 due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 October 2014. The fair value of all of the reporting units except Latin America substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 September 2014. The fair value of our Latin America reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. The fair value of the Latin America reporting unit was estimated based on a similar outlook and assumptions as those used for the 1 July 2014 testing, and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value primarily due to depreciation and amortization and the $20.6 impact of the Chilean tax rate change. During the first quarter of 2015, we conducted an impairment test based on our new reporting structure. As of 1 October 2014, we determined that the fair value of all of our new reporting units, except Latin America, substantially exceeded their carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The Latin America reporting unit, now within the Industrial Gases – Americas segment, did not change as a result of the reorganization and its fair value was based on a similar long-term outlook and assumptions as those used in the 2014 impairment testing. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing noting no indications of impairment. The fair value of all of our reporting units, except for our Latin America reporting unit, continued to substantially exceed their carrying value. The fair value of our Latin America reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. The excess of fair value over carrying value for our other reporting units ranged from approximately 70% to approximately 250%. Management judgement is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of these reporting units. In this scenario, the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 50% to 220%. As of 30 September 2015, the carrying value of the Latin America goodwill was $200.9, or approximately 1% of consolidated total assets. The reporting unit represents approximately 5% of the Company’s total consolidated sales. Revenue growth and EBITDA margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value of our Latin America reporting unit, and these assumptions are underpinned by our expectations for long-term manufacturing growth in the region. In the event of further declines in long-term manufacturing growth projections, we may need to perform additional impairment analysis. We determined that with other assumptions held constant, a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 300 basis points or a decrease in EBITDA margins of approximately 200 basis points would result in the fair value of the reporting unit being equal to its carrying value, which would require that we perform step 2 of the impairment analysis to assess the need for additional goodwill impairment. The Latin America reporting unit has other material assets that include: Plant and equipment, net of $363.5, customer relationships of $172.5, and trade names and trademarks of $60.1. The trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. See impairment considerations for these assets within the Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets sections of our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: longer-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in additional impairment charges. We will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results or changes in management’s business outlook or strategy. 49 Table of Contents Intangible Assets Intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 September 2015 totaled $448.2 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2015 totaled $60.1 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we conducted our annual impairment test and determined that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. Refer to Note 11, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles and found no indications of impairment. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,265.7 at 30 September 2015. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2015, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $55.8 and $720.7, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2015 were $97.5, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2015 was $415.9. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include 50 Table of Contents forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $17. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. In fiscal year 2015, our mortality assumptions were aligned with the IRS mortality assumption used to determine funding valuations, with the exception of the U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan, in which we adopted the Society of Actuaries new mortality tables upon re-measurement of the plan required as a result of pension settlements and curtailments in 2015. As of 30 September 2015, our projected benefit obligation reflects the adoption of the Society of Actuaries new mortality tables for all major plans. Our mortality assumptions will differ from the IRS mortality assumptions used to determine funding valuations, as the IRS is not expected to adopt the new tables until 2017. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of high-quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. This rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $31 per year. Effective in fiscal year 2016, we will use a spot rate approach to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for most of our defined benefit pension plans. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $19 per year. We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. For equities, this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets. 51 Table of Contents The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $14 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about earnings guidance and business outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, global or regional economic conditions and supply and demand dynamics in market segments into which the Company sells; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; with regard to the intended spin-off of Materials Technologies, general economic and business conditions that may affect the proposed spin-off and the execution thereof, changes in capital market conditions, and Air Products’ decision not to consummate the spin-off due to market, economic or other events; future financial and operating performance of major customers; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific events; the impact of competitive products and pricing; challenges of implementing new technologies; ability to protect and enforce the Company’s intellectual property rights; unexpected changes in raw material supply and markets; the impact of price fluctuations in natural gas and disruptions in markets and the economy due to oil price volatility; the ability to recover increased energy and raw material costs from customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory investigations; the success of productivity and cost reduction programs; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; political risks, including the risks of unanticipated government actions; acts of war or terrorism; the impact of changes in environmental, tax or other legislation and regulatory activities in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; and other risk factors described in Section 1A, Risk Factors. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases. Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. At 30 September 2015 and 2014, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $4,452.0 and $5,044.9, respectively. The decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to repayment of long-term debt and a stronger U.S. dollar which reduced the translated value of foreign currency debt and increased the fair value of our outstanding derivatives. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date. Interest Rate Risk Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2015, including the effect of currency swap agreements, primarily comprised debt denominated in U.S. dollars (46%) and Euros (23%). This debt portfolio is composed of 48% fixed-rate debt and 52% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position. The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2015, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $139 and $173 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2015 and 2014, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $151 and $188 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2015 and 2014, respectively. Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $30 and $31 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2015 and 2014, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $30 and $31 per year at 30 September 2015 and 2014, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2015 and 2014, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $421 and $419 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2015 and 2014, respectively. 53 Table of Contents The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are Euros and U.S. dollars, Euros and British Pound Sterling, and British Pound Sterling and U.S. dollars. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. The majority of the Company’s sales are derived from outside of the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. Financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Euro represents the largest exposure in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in the Euro versus the U.S. dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $20. 54 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:30.650344

Air Products is also the world’s leading supplier of liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment. The Company’s Materials Technologies business serves the semiconductor, polyurethanes, cleaning and coatings, and adhesives industry. With operations in over 50 countries, in 2016 we had sales of $9.5 billion, assets of $18.1 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 18,600 employees. As of 30 September 2016, our operations were organized into six reportable business segments: Industrial Gases- Americas, Industrial Gases- EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Industrial Gases- Asia, Industrial Gases- Global, Materials Technologies, and Corporate and other. The financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on these operations. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, we committed to exit the Energy-from-Waste (EfW) business. The EfW segment is presented as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, prior year EfW business segment information has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. The Company’s Materials Technologies business contains the Electronic Materials Division (EMD) and Performance Materials Division (PMD). We completed the spin-off of EMD as Versum Materials, Inc. on 1 October 2016. PMD is under a sales agreement subject to regulatory approval. 22 Table of Contents Refer to Note 26, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments and Note 3, Materials Technologies Separation, for additional information on EMD and PMD. 2016 IN SUMMARY In 2016, we delivered strong results driven by cost improvement actions despite weakness in the worldwide economy and currency headwinds. We made significant progress on our strategy by focusing on our core industrial gases business and have significantly improved our profitability as measured by operating margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted EBITDA margin which all increased by at least 400 bp versus the prior year. During the year, we committed to exit our EfW business and completed the spin-off of our Electronic Materials division as a publicly traded company on 1 October 2016. We improved our focus on safety, delivered on our cost reduction targets, and increased accountability by aligning pay with performance. These changes drove increased profitability as we delivered operating margins of 22.1%, adjusted operating margins of 23.1%, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 34.4%. Also, EPS of $6.94 increased 17% from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS of $7.55 increased 14%. Highlights for 2016 • Sales of $9,524.4 decreased 4%, or $370.5. Underlying sales growth of 2% was more than offset by unfavorable currency and lower energy contractual cost pass-through to customers. Underlying sales increased from higher volumes in Industrial Gases – Global and Industrial Gases – Asia. • Operating income of $2,106.0 increased 23%, or $397.7, primarily due to better cost performance. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $2,198.5 increased 16%, or $305.3. Adjusted EBITDA of $3,273.0 increased 10%, or $288.9. • Income from continuing operations of $1,515.3 increased 18%, or $230.6, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.94 increased 17%, or $1.03. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,647.8 increased 15%, or $214.0, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.55 increased 14%, or $0.95. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share, including a non-GAAP reconciliation, is presented below. • We entered into a sales agreement to sell the Performance Materials division of our Materials Technologies segment to Evonik, which is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. • We completed the spin-off of the Electronic Materials division as Versum Materials, Inc. on 1 October 2016. • We committed to exit the Energy-from-Waste business. • We increased our quarterly dividend by 6% from $.81 to $.86 per share. This represents the 34th consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to our 2017 Outlook below. 23 Table of Contents Changes in Diluted Earnings per Share Attributable to Air Products 2016 2015 Increase(Decrease) Diluted Earnings per Share Net income $2.89 $5.88 $(2.99 ) Loss from discontinued operations (4.05 ) (.03 ) (4.02 ) Income from Continuing Operations—GAAP Basis $6.94 $5.91 $1.03 Operating income (after-tax) Underlying business Volume (.01 ) Price/raw materials .29 Costs/other .94 Currency (.16 ) Business separation costs (.19 ) Business restructuring and cost reduction actions .60 Pension settlement loss .04 Gain on previously held equity interest (.05 ) Gain on land sales (.13 ) Operating Income 1.33 Other (after-tax) Equity affiliates’ income (.02 ) Interest expense (.04 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt .05 Income tax (.06 ) Tax costs related to business separation (.24 ) Noncontrolling interests .04 Average shares outstanding (.03 ) Other (.30 ) Total Change in Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations—GAAP Basis $1.03 2016 2015 Increase(Decrease) Income from Continuing Operations—GAAP Basis $6.94 $5.91 $1.03 Business separation costs .22 .03 .19 Tax costs related to business separation .24 — .24 Business restructuring and cost reduction actions .11 .71 (.60 ) Pension settlement loss .02 .06 (.04 ) Gain on previously held equity interest — (.05 ) .05 Gain on land sales — (.13 ) .13 Loss on extinguishment of debt .02 .07 (.05 ) Income from Continuing Operations—Non-GAAP Basis $7.55 $6.60 $.95 2017 OUTLOOK For 2017, we intend to remain focused on key actions we can control to continue to drive earnings growth. We intend to accomplish this by bringing new industrial gas plant investments on-stream, making progress on the Jazan sale of equipment project, and continuing to deliver on cost reduction actions. We expect continued weakness in new LNG equipment orders primarily driven by low oil and natural gas prices. 24 Table of Contents On 1 October 2016, we completed the separation of our Electronic Materials division through the spin-off of Versum Materials, Inc. We continue to make progress on the sale of our Performance Materials division and are targeting to close on the sale in fiscal year 2017. Fiscal 2017 earnings will be lower due to the separation of Electronic Materials. If we are able to close on the sale of Performance Materials and it becomes a discontinued operation in fiscal 2017, we expect earnings will be reduced further. The above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2016 2015 2014 Sales $9,524.4 $9,894.9 $10,439.0 Operating income—GAAP Basis 2,106.0 1,708.3 1,339.1 Operating margin—GAAP Basis 22.1% 17.3% 12.8% Equity affiliates’ income 148.6 154.5 151.4 Non-GAAP Basis Adjusted EBITDA 3,273.0 2,984.1 2,775.7 Adjusted EBITDA margin 34.4% 30.2% 26.6% Operating income 2,198.5 1,893.2 1,667.4 Operating margin 23.1% 19.1% 16.0% Sales % Change from Prior Year 2016 2015 Underlying business Volume 2% 2% Price —% 1% Energy and raw material cost pass-through (3)% (3)% Currency (3)% (5)% Total Consolidated Change (4)% (5)% 2016 vs. 2015 Sales of $9,524.4 decreased 4%, or $370.5. Underlying sales increased 2% primarily due to higher volumes in Industrial Gases – Global and Industrial Gases – Asia, partially offset by lower volumes in all other segments. Price was flat as increases in the Industrial Gases – Americas and Industrial Gases – EMEA segments were offset by lower prices in Industrial Gases – Asia. Underlying sales growth was more than offset by lower energy contractual cost pass-through to customers of 3% and unfavorable currency of 3%. 2015 vs. 2014 Sales of $9,894.9 decreased 5%, or $544.1. Underlying sales were up 3% from higher volumes of 2% and higher pricing of 1%. Volumes increased primarily from new plant on-streams in Industrial Gases – Asia and base business growth in Materials Technologies. The favorable pricing was primarily driven by price increases in the Industrial Gases – Americas and Materials Technologies segments. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 5% and lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers decreased sales by 3%. Operating Income and Margin 2016 vs. 2015 On a GAAP basis, operating income of $2,106.0 increased 23%, or $397.7, as lower operating costs of $271, lower business restructuring and cost reduction actions of $174, favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs, of $84, and lower pension settlement losses of $15, were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of $46, higher business separation costs of $45, and lower volumes of $4. In addition, the prior year included a gain on land sales of $34 and a gain of $18 on a previously held equity interest. Operating costs decreased due to benefits from our cost reduction actions of $132, lower pension expense of $38, lower maintenance expense of $34, and lower other costs of $67. 25 Table of Contents Operating margin of 22.1% increased 480 bp, primarily due to favorable costs and favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $2,198.5 increased 16%, or $305.3, and operating margin of 23.1% increased 400 bp. 2015 vs. 2014 On a GAAP basis, operating income of $1,708.3 increased 28%, or $369.2, primarily from higher volumes of $144, favorable pricing, net of energy and fuel costs, of $105, and favorable cost performance across most segments of $92, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of $115. In addition, operating income in 2015 included a charge for business reorganization and cost reduction actions of $208, a pension settlement loss of $21, business separation costs of $8, gains on land sales of $34, and a gain of $18 on revaluing a previously held equity interest upon purchase of our partner’s shares. Operating income in 2014 included a goodwill and intangible asset charge of $310, a business restructuring and cost reduction charge of $13, and a pension settlement loss of $6. The favorable operating costs of $92 included benefits from our cost reduction actions of $170 and lower maintenance expense of $33, partially offset by higher incentive compensation of approximately $100 due to improved results. Operating margin of 17.3% increased 450 bp. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,893.2 increased 14%, or $225.8. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes of $144, favorable pricing, net of energy and fuel costs, of $105, and favorable cost performance across most segments of $92, partially offset by unfavorable currency of $115. Costs were lower as benefits from cost reduction actions of approximately $170 and lower maintenance expense of $33 were offset by higher incentive compensation of approximately $100 due to improved results. Non-GAAP operating margin of 19.1% increased 310 bp due to favorable costs, higher volumes, and higher pricing. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the Company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance. 2016 vs. 2015 Adjusted EBITDA of $3,273.0 increased $288.9, or 10%, primarily due to favorable costs and favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.4% increased 420 bp. 2015 vs. 2014 Adjusted EBITDA of $2,984.1 increased $208.4, or 8%, due to higher volumes, higher pricing, and favorable costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.2% increased 360 bp. Equity Affiliates’ Income 2016 vs. 2015 Income from equity affiliates of $148.6 decreased $5.9, as lower income from Industrial Gases – Americas and Industrial Gases – EMEA affiliates was partially offset by higher income from Industrial Gases – Asia affiliates. 2015 vs. 2014 Income from equity affiliates of $154.5 increased $3.1, primarily due to higher volumes and favorable cost performance in our Industrial Gases – Asia and Industrial Gases – Americas affiliates. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 2016 vs. 2015 Cost of sales of $6,402.7 decreased $536.3, or 8%, primarily due to lower energy costs of $271, lower operating costs of $239, and a favorable currency impact of $202, partially offset by higher costs attributable to sales volumes of $176. Operating costs included favorable impacts from cost reduction actions of $57, lower maintenance costs of $34, lower pension expense of $24, as well as the benefits of other operational improvements and productivity. Costs associated with volumes were higher primarily due to the Jazan sale of equipment activity. Gross margin of 32.8% increased 290 bp, primarily due to lower costs. 26 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 Cost of sales of $6,939.0 decreased $690.9, or 9%, primarily due to a favorable currency impact of $368, lower energy costs of $313, and lower operating costs of $102, partially offset by costs attributable to higher sales volumes of $92. Operating costs included favorable impacts from cost reduction actions of $48 and lower other costs, including maintenance, of $115, partially offset by higher incentive compensation of $61. Gross margin of 29.9% increased 300 bp, due to lower costs of 120 bp, higher price, net of raw materials, of 100 bp, and higher volumes of 80 bp. Selling and Administrative Expense 2016 vs. 2015 Selling and administrative expense of $849.3 decreased $90.0, or 10%, primarily due to the benefits of cost reduction actions of $68 and favorable currency effects of $28, partially offset by higher other costs of $6. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 8.9% from 9.5%. 2015 vs. 2014 Selling and administrative expense of $939.3 decreased $115.4, or 11%, primarily due to the benefits of cost reduction actions of $122 and favorable currency effects of $62, partially offset by higher other costs of $69, driven by higher incentive compensation. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 9.5% from 10.1%. Research and Development 2016 vs. 2015 Research and development expense of $132.0 decreased $5.1, or 4%. Fiscal year 2016 and 2015 research and development expense as a percent of sales was 1.4%. 2015 vs. 2014 Research and development expense of $137.1 decreased $2.7, or 2%. Fiscal year 2015 and 2014 research and development expense as a percent of sales was 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively. Business Separation Costs On 16 September 2015, the Company announced plans to separate its Materials Technologies business, which contains two divisions, Electronic Materials (EMD) and Performance Materials (PMD), into an independent publicly traded company and distribute to Air Products shareholders all of the shares of the new public company in a tax free distribution (a “spin-off”). Versum Materials, LLC, or Versum, was formed as the new company to hold the Materials Technologies business subject to the spin-off. On 6 May 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the PMD division to Evonik Industries AG for $3.8 billion in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. As a result, the Company moved forward with the planned spin-off of Versum containing only the EMD division. On 1 October 2016, Air Products completed the separation of its EMD division through the spin-off of Versum. As a result, the historical results of EMD will be presented as a discontinued operation beginning in fiscal year 2017. We continue to evaluate the progress of the sale of the PMD division to determine when it should be presented as a discontinued operation. In fiscal year 2016, we incurred separation costs of $52.2 ($48.3 after-tax, or $.22 per share), primarily related to legal, advisory, and indirect tax costs associated with these transactions. The costs are reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Business separation costs.” A significant portion of these costs were not tax deductible because they were directly related to the plan for the tax-free spin-off of Versum. Our income tax provision includes additional tax expense related to the separation of $51.8 ($.24 per share), of which $45.7 resulted from a dividend declared during the third quarter of 2016 to repatriate $443.8 from a subsidiary in South Korea to the U.S. Previously, most of these foreign earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We expect to incur additional legal and advisory fees in fiscal 2017. On 30 September 2016, in anticipation of the spin-off, Versum entered into certain financing transactions to allow for a cash distribution of $550.0 and a distribution in-kind of notes issued by Versum with an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 to Air Products. Air Products then exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for 27 Table of Contents $418.3 of Air Products’ outstanding commercial paper. The exchange resulted in a loss of $6.9 ($4.3 after-tax, or $.02 per share) and has been reflected on the consolidated income statements as “Loss on extinguishment of debt.” This loss is deductible for tax purposes. Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions We recorded charges in 2016, 2015, and 2014 for business restructuring and cost reduction actions. The charges for these actions are excluded from segment operating income. Cost Reduction Actions In fiscal year 2016, we recognized an expense of $33.9 ($24.0 after-tax, or $.11 per share) for severance and other benefits related to cost reduction actions resulting from the elimination of approximately 700 positions. The expense related primarily to the Industrial Gases – Americas and the Industrial Gases – EMEA segments. Business Realignment and Reorganization On 18 September 2014, we announced plans to reorganize the Company, including realignment of our businesses in new reporting segments and other organizational changes, effective as of 1 October 2014, which at the time resulted in the largest transformational change in the history of the Company. As a result of this reorganization, we incurred severance and other charges. In fiscal year 2015, we recognized an expense of $207.7 ($153.2 after-tax, or $.71 per share). Severance and other benefits totaled $151.9 and related to the elimination of approximately 2,000 positions. Asset and associated contract actions totaled $55.8 and related primarily to a plant shutdown in the Corporate and other segment and the exit of product lines within Industrial Gases – Global and Materials Technologies segments. During the fourth quarter of 2014, an expense of $12.7 ($8.2 after-tax, or $.04 per share) was incurred relating to the elimination of approximately 50 positions. Refer to Note 5, Business Restructuring and Cost Reduction Actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions. Pension Settlement Loss Certain of our pension plans provide for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the retirement date. Pension settlements are recognized when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. We recognized $6.4 ($4.1 after-tax, or $.02 per share), $21.2 ($13.7 after-tax, or $.06 per share), and $5.5 ($3.6 after-tax, or $.02 per share) of settlement charges in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The settlement accelerated the recognition of a portion of actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily related to our U.S. Supplementary Pension Plan. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charge During the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily acquired trade names) associated with our Latin America reporting unit of our Industrial Gases – Americas segment were impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of $310.1 ($275.1 attributable to Air Products after-tax, or $1.27 per share). Gain on Previously Held Equity Interest On 30 December 2014, we acquired our partner’s equity ownership interest in a liquefied atmospheric industrial gases production joint venture in North America for $22.6 which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and subsequent to the acquisition, the results are consolidated within our Industrial Gases – Americas segment. The assets acquired, primarily plant and equipment, were recorded at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The acquisition date fair value of the previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis under the income approach. During the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a gain of $17.9 ($11.2 after-tax, or $.05 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair value as of the acquisition date. 28 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Items recorded to other income (expense), net arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. The detail of other income (expense), net is presented in Note 24, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2016 vs. 2015 Other income (expense), net of $58.1 increased $10.8 primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses, favorable contract settlements, and receipt of a government subsidy. The prior year included a gain of $33.6 ($28.3 after-tax, or $.13 per share) resulting from the sale of two parcels of land. No other individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2015 vs. 2014 Other income (expense), net of $47.3 decreased $5.5 and included a gain of $33.6 ($28.3 after-tax, or $.13 per share) resulting from the sale of two parcels of land. The gain was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and lower gains on other sales of assets and emissions credits. No other individual items were significant in comparison to fiscal year 2014. Interest Expense 2016 2015 2014 Interest incurred $148.4 $152.6 $158.1 Less: Capitalized interest 32.9 49.1 33.0 Interest Expense $115.5 $103.5 $125.1 2016 vs. 2015 Interest incurred decreased $4.2. The decrease primarily resulted from a stronger U.S. dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest of $6, partially offset by a higher average debt balance of $2. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in the carrying value of projects under construction, primarily as a result of our exit from the Energy-from-Waste business. 2015 vs. 2014 Interest incurred decreased $5.5. The decrease was driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest of $12, partially offset by a higher average debt balance of $7. The change in capitalized interest was driven by a higher carrying value in construction in progress. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt On 30 September 2016, in anticipation of the Versum spin-off, Versum issued $425.0 of notes to Air Products, who then exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for $418.3 of Air Products’ outstanding commercial paper. The exchange resulted in a loss of $6.9 ($4.3 after-tax, or $.02 per share). In September 2015, we made a payment of $146.6 to redeem 3,000,000 Unidades de Fomento (“UF”) Series E 6.30% Bonds due 22 January 2030 that had a carrying value of $130.0 and resulted in a net loss of $16.6 ($14.2 after-tax, or $.07 per share). Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2016 vs. 2015 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 27.5% and 24.0% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change included a 240 bp impact from tax costs associated with business separation, primarily resulting from a dividend declared in 2016 to repatriate cash from a foreign subsidiary, as discussed above in “Business Separation Costs.” The remaining 110 bp change was primarily due to the increase in mix of income in jurisdictions with a higher effective tax rate and the impact of business separation costs for which a tax benefit was not available. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate increased from 24.2% in 2015 to 24.8% in 2016, primarily due to the increase in and mix of income in jurisdictions with a higher effective tax rate. 29 Table of Contents 2015 vs. 2014 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.0% and 27.1% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $305.2, which was not deductible for tax purposes, and the Chilean tax reform enacted in September 2014 which increased income tax expense by $20.6. These impacts were partially offset by an income tax benefit of $51.6 associated with losses from transactions and a tax election in a non-U.S. subsidiary. Refer to Note 10, Goodwill, and Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% and 24.1% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Discontinued Operations On 29 March 2016, the Board of Directors approved the Company’s exit of its Energy-from-Waste (EfW) business. As a result, efforts to start up and operate its two EfW projects located in Tees Valley, United Kingdom, have been discontinued. The decision to exit the business and stop development of the projects was based on continued difficulties encountered and the Company’s conclusion, based on testing and analysis completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, that significant additional time and resources would be required to make the projects operational. In addition, the decision allows the Company to execute its strategy of focusing resources on its core Industrial Gases business. The EfW segment has been presented as a discontinued operation. Prior year EfW business segment information has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. In fiscal 2016, our loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $884.2 primarily resulted from the write down of assets to their estimated net realizable value and to record a liability for plant disposition and other costs. Income tax benefits related only to one of the projects, as the other did not qualify for a local tax deduction. The loss from discontinued operations also includes land lease costs, commercial and administrative costs, and costs incurred for ongoing project exit activities. We expect additional exit costs of $50 to $100 to be recorded in future periods. In fiscal 2015, our loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, related to EfW was $6.8. This resulted from costs for land leases and commercial and administrative expenses. In fiscal 2014, our loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $2.9. This included a loss, net of tax, of $7.5 for the cost of EfW land leases and commercial and administrative expenses. This loss was partially offset by a gain of $3.9 for the sale of the remaining Homecare business and settlement of contingencies related to a sale of a separate portion of the business to The Linde Group in 2012. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, for additional details.

Volumes were down due to weakness in Latin America and lower steel demand in North America. Pricing was higher due to the benefit of pricing actions, mainly the recovery of inflationary and power cost increases in Latin America. Lower energy contractual cost pass-through to customers, primarily natural gas, decreased sales by 6%. Currency decreased sales by 2% primarily due to the impacts of the Chilean Peso, Brazilian Real, and Canadian Dollar. Operating income of $895.2 increased 11%, or $86.8, due to lower operating costs of $108 and higher pricing, net of energy and fuel costs, of $26, partially offset by lower volumes of $33 and unfavorable currency impacts of $14. Operating costs were lower due to benefits from cost reduction actions. Operating margin increased 490 bp from the prior year, primarily due to the lower costs, with additional benefits from lower energy pass-through and higher pricing. Equity affiliates’ income of $52.7 decreased $11.9 primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and higher maintenance expense. 2015 vs. 2014 Underlying sales increased 2% from higher pricing. Volumes were flat as growth in liquid oxygen and nitrogen and gaseous hydrogen were offset by lower helium and gaseous oxygen demand. Pricing was higher due to strength in helium and price increases to recover higher costs. Currency decreased sales by 3% primarily due to the impacts of the Chilean Peso, Brazilian Real, and Canadian Dollar. Lower energy contractual cost pass-through to customers, primarily natural gas, decreased sales by 8%. Operating income of $808.4 increased 6%, or $45.8, due to higher pricing net of energy and fuel costs of $65 and favorable volume mix impacts of $6, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of $21 and higher costs of $4 mainly due to higher incentive compensation mostly offset by the benefits of our recent restructuring actions.

These financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. In many cases, our non-GAAP measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to exclude certain disclosed items (“non-GAAP adjustments”) that we believe are not representative of the underlying business performance. For example, Air Products is currently executing its strategic plan to restructure the Company and to focus on the Company’s core Industrial Gases businesses, which has and will continue to result in significant disclosed items that we believe are important for investors to understand separately from the performance of the underlying business. The tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions. In evaluating these financial measures, the reader should be aware that we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation in the future. Investors should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.

The cash and cash items balance is higher than our historical trend and primarily results from transactions related to the anticipated spin-off of Versum and positive operating cash flows. Approximately $1,000.0 of debt was raised by Versum in September which included a $575.0 term loan that drove an increase in cash and cash items. We expect our cash balance and cash flows from operating and financing activities to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. As of 30 September 2016, we had $545.3 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $1,501.3. If the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the U.S. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the U.S. Current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds. Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2016 2015 2014 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $2,707.4 $2,446.4 $2,190.1 Investing activities (972.0 ) (1,250.5 ) (1,316.5 ) Financing activities (271.1 ) (945.4 ) (504.3 ) Operating Activities For the year ended 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $2,707.4. Income from continuing operations of $1,515.3 included a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.9. Income from continuing operations is adjusted for reconciling items that include depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, share-based compensation, noncurrent capital lease receivables, and undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Other adjustments of $155.2 were primarily driven by the remeasurement of intercompany transactions as the related hedging instruments that eliminate the earnings impact are included in other receivables and payables and accrued liabilities. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $20.1 that were primarily driven by trade receivables and other working capital partially offset by payables and accrued liabilities. The use of cash from other working capital of $57.4 was primarily driven by advances associated with the purchase of helium. The increase in payables and accrued liabilities of $57.0 was primarily related to an increase in customer advances which includes payment from our joint venture in Jazan, Saudi Arabia and was partially offset by the changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that hedge intercompany loans. For the year ended 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $2,446.4. Income from continuing operations of $1,284.7 included the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $47.4, a non-cash gain on the previously held equity interest of $17.9, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.6. Other adjustments included pension and postretirement expense of $141.4 and contributions to our pension plans of $137.5, primarily for plans in the U.S. and U.K. Management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including tax, cash flow, and regulatory implications. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $224.7. The increase of payables and accrued liabilities of $156.2 includes an increase in accrued incentive compensation of $97.0. For the year ended 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $2,190.1. Income from continuing operations of $994.6 included the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $310.1. Other adjustments included $143.2 for pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by a use of cash of $78.2 for pension contributions. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $250.0. Inventory was a use of cash of $23.5 primarily due to the timing of helium purchases. The reduction of payables and accrued liabilities of $237.9 includes $148.5 for payments associated with projects accounted for as capital leases and $52.5 of payments related to the 2013 business restructuring and cost reduction plan. 41 Table of Contents Investing Activities For the year ended 30 September 2016, cash used for investing activities was $972.0, driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment of $1,055.8. Proceeds from the sale of assets and investments of $85.5 was primarily driven by the receipt of $30.0 for our rights to a corporate aircraft that was under construction, $15.9 for the sale of our 20% equity investment in Daido Air Products Electronics, Inc., and $14.9 for the sale of a wholly owned subsidiary located in Wuhu, China. For the year ended 30 September 2015, cash used for investing activities was $1,250.5, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment. On 30 December 2014, we acquired our partner’s equity ownership interest in a liquefied atmospheric industrial gases production joint venture in North America which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. Refer to Note 6, Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. For the year ended 30 September 2014, cash used for investing activities was $1,316.5, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment. Refer to the Capital Expenditures section below for additional detail. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2016 2015 2014 Additions to plant and equipment $1,055.8 $1,265.6 $1,362.7 Acquisitions, less cash acquired — 34.5 — Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates — 4.3 (2.0 ) Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $1,055.8 $1,304.4 $1,360.7 Capital lease expenditures(A) 27.2 95.6 202.4 Purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary(A) — 278.4 .5 Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $1,083.0 $1,678.4 $1,563.6 (A) We utilize a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities, if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. Additionally, the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests is accounted for as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The presentation of this non-GAAP measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2016 totaled $1,055.8, compared to $1,265.6 in 2015. The decrease of $209.8 was primarily due to the completion of major projects in 2016 and 2015. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Spending in 2016 and 2015 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen for coal gasification in China, hydrogen to the global market, oxygen to the steel industry, nitrogen to the electronic semiconductor industry, and capacity expansion for the Materials Technologies segment. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2016 totaled $1,083.0 compared to $1,678.4 in 2015. The decrease of $595.4 was primarily due to the prior year purchase of the 30.5% equity interest in our Indura S.A. subsidiary from the largest minority shareholder for $277.9. Refer to Note 21, Noncontrolling Interests, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Additionally, capital lease expenditures of $27.2, decreased by $68.4, reflecting lower project spending. On 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded noncash transactions which resulted in an increase of $26.9 and $67.5, respectively, to our investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates for our obligation to invest in the joint venture. These noncash transactions have been excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows. In total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. Air Products has also entered into a sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer, procure, and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply the gases to Saudi Aramco. 42 Table of Contents Sales backlog represents our estimate of revenue to be recognized in the future on our share of Air Products’ sale of equipment orders and related process technology that are under firm contracts. The sales backlog for the Company at 30 September 2016 was $1,057, compared to $1,535 at 30 September 2015. The decrease was driven by progress on the Jazan project and completion of LNG orders. 2017 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2017 are expected to be approximately $1,200. A majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants that are currently under construction or expected to start construction. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. Financing Activities For the year ended 2016, cash used for financing activities was $271.1. Our borrowings (short- and long-term proceeds, net of repayments) were a net source of cash (issuance) of $331.2 and included debt proceeds from the issuance of a .375% Eurobond of €350 million ($386.9) on 1 June 2016 and the issuance of a $575.0 term loan by Versum in anticipation of the spin-off, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt, including the 2.0% Senior Note of $350.0 million on 2 August 2016, and a $144.2 use of cash for net commercial paper and other short-term debt borrowings. Versum distributed in-kind notes with an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 to Air Products. However, since Air Products exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for $418.3 of Air Products’ outstanding commercial paper, this non-cash debt for debt exchange was excluded from the consolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. We also used cash to pay dividends of $721.2 and received proceeds from stock option exercises of $141.3. For the year ended 2015, cash used for financing activities was $945.4 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $677.5 and payments for subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interest of $278.4, which was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $121.3. Our borrowings were a net use of cash of $84.4 and included $284.0 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances, debt proceeds from the issuance of a 1.0% Eurobond of €300 million ($335.3), repayment of a 3.875% Eurobond of €300 million ($335.9), repayment of Industrial Revenue Bonds totaling $147.2, and repayment of 3,000,000 Unidades de Fomento (“UF”) Series E 6.30% Bonds totaling $146.6. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. For the year ended 2014, cash used for financing activities was $504.3 primarily attributable to cash used to pay dividends of $627.7 which was partially offset by proceeds from stock options exercised of $141.6. Our borrowings were a net use of cash (issuance) of $3.5 and included $148.7 of net commercial paper and other short-term debt issuances, debt proceeds from the issuance of a $400 senior fixed-rate 3.35% note on 31 July 2014 and $61.0 of other, primarily international, debt issuances and debt repayments of a 3.75% Eurobond of €300 million ($401.0) in November 2013 and $207.6 of other, primarily international, debt. Discontinued Operations For the year ended 2016, discontinued operations primarily includes the Energy-from-Waste business which the Company decided to exit in the second quarter of 2016. Cash used by discontinued operations was $176.9 primarily driven by capital expenditures for plant and equipment of $97.0 and the loss from discontinued operations of $37.6. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. For the year ended 2015, cash used by discontinued operations was $357.8. The use of cash was primarily driven by expenditures for plant and equipment of $349.2 related to the Energy-from-Waste facilities. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. For the year ended 2014, cash used by discontinued operations was $471.8. The use of cash was driven by capital expenditures of $321.5 for our Energy-from-Waste facilities and a payment made to the Linde Group for contingent proceeds we were obligated to return from the sale of our Homecare business of $157.1. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 43 Table of Contents Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2016 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2016, total debt outstanding was $6,225.2 compared to $5,879.0 at the end of 2015, and cash and cash items were $1,501.3 compared to $206.4 at the end of 2015. Total debt at 30 September 2016 and 2015, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt plus total equity), was 46.3% and 44.3%, respectively. During fiscal 2013, we entered into a five-year $2,500.0 revolving credit agreement maturing 30 April 2018 with a syndicate of banks (the “2013 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to both the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. There have been subsequent amendments to the 2013 Credit Agreement, and as of 30 September 2016, the maximum borrowing capacity was $2,690.0. The 2013 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity for the Company and supports its commercial paper program. This credit facility includes a financial covenant for a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization no greater than 70%. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2013 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2016. During September 2016, in anticipation of the Versum spin-off, Versum entered into certain financing transactions to allow for a cash distribution of $550.0 and a distribution in-kind of notes issued by Versum with an aggregate principal amount of $425.0 to Air Products. Air Products then exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for $418.3 of Air Products’ outstanding commercial paper. Since Versum debt was issued in September but Versum did not become a separate entity until 1 October 2016, Air Products’ consolidated balance sheet includes the Versum debt. The $575.0 term loan and the $425.0 of notes were included in the Versum spin-off transaction and do not represent obligation of the Company in the future. In addition, Versum entered into a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility (Versum Revolving Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 that matures on 30 September 2021. Lenders under the Revolving Facility have a maximum first lien net leverage ratio covenant (total debt net of cash on hand to total adjusted EBITDA) of 3.25:1.00 and certain other customary covenants. No borrowings were outstanding on the Versum Revolving Facility as of 30 September 2016. Refer to Note 3, Materials Technologies Separation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Commitments totaling $51.3 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, all of which was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2016. As of 30 September 2016, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements. On 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal years 2016, 2015 or 2014. At 30 September 2016, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains. 2017 Outlook Cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future and our working capital balance was $1,034.0 at 30 September 2016. We expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants. We expect to utilize the proceeds from the distribution from Versum to pay down debt, largely commercial paper, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Dividends Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. During 2016, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from $.81 per share to $.86 per share. 44 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We are obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes our obligations as of 30 September 2016: Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $5,289 $371 $419 $407 $353 $417 $3,322 Contractual interest 880 131 119 117 99 91 323 Capital leases 31 2 1 2 2 3 21 Operating leases 355 71 62 50 38 32 102 Pension obligations 1,211 67 50 51 52 56 935 Unconditional purchase obligations 5,331 942 525 307 298 276 2,983 Obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate 100 — — — 100 — — Total Contractual Obligations $13,197 $1,584 $1,176 $934 $942 $875 $7,686 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. We had $1,396 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2016, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2016. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Consistent with the debt maturities table within Note 15, Debt, the long-term debt obligations reflect financing entered into in anticipation of the spin-off of EMD as Versum Materials, Inc. The spin-off was completed on 1 October 2016 and the related debt of $997.2 was maintained by Versum. Leases Refer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Approximately $4,000 of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium purchases, which include crude feedstock supply to multiple helium refining plants in North America as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world. As a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain take-or-pay provisions. The refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas, primarily under medium-term requirements contracts. While contract terms in the energy sector are longer than those in merchant, helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties. Approximately $330 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to 45 Table of Contents the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconditional purchase obligations. The unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers. Purchase commitments to spend approximately $350 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2017. In addition, we have purchase commitments totaling approximately $500 in 2017 and 2018 relating to our long-term sale of equipment project for Saudi Aramco’s Jazan oil refinery. We also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. Obligation for Future Contribution to an Equity Affiliate On 19 April 2015, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Saudi Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns 25% of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan. In total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. As of 30 September 2016, we recorded a noncurrent liability of $94.4 for our obligation to make future equity contributions based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2016 were $767.1. Tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2016 were $106.9. These tax liabilities were excluded from the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. In addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. Refer to Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. PENSION BENEFITS The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. Over the long run, the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. The fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2016 measurement date increased to $4,116.4 from $3,916.4 at the end of fiscal year 2015. The projected benefit obligation for these plans was $5,327.3 and $4,787.8 at the end of the fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net unfunded liability increased by approximately $340 from $871 to $1,211 due primarily to lower discount rates. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits. 46 Table of Contents Pension Expense 2016 2015 2014 Pension expense $68.1 $135.6 $135.9 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 7.3 35.2 5.8 Weighted average discount rate(A) 4.1 % 4.0 % 4.6 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 7.5 % 7.4 % 7.7 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 3.5 % 3.5 % 3.9 % (A) Effective in 2016, the Company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs. The Company has accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation. 2016 vs. 2015 Pension expense, excluding special items, decreased from the prior year due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost, the impact from expected return on assets and demographic gains, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans. Special items of $7.3 included pension settlement losses of $6.4, special termination benefits of $2.0, and curtailment gains of $1.1. These resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions. 2015 vs. 2014 The decrease in pension expense, excluding special items, was due to the impact from expected return on assets, a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption, and lower service cost and interest cost. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses, which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate. Special items of $35.2 included pension settlement losses of $21.2, special termination benefits of $8.7, and curtailment losses of $5.3. These resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions. 2017 Outlook In 2017, pension expense, excluding special items, is estimated to be approximately $70 to $75, an increase of $10 to $15 from 2016, resulting primarily from a decrease in discount rates, offset by favorable asset experience, effects of the Versum spin-off and the adoption of new mortality tables. Pension settlement losses of $10 to $15 are expected, dependent on the timing of retirements. In 2017, we expect pension expense to include approximately $164 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $121 in 2016. Net actuarial losses of $484 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2016, primarily attributable to lower discount rates and improved mortality projections. Actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company expects to record a curtailment loss estimated to be $5 to $10 related to employees transferring to Versum. The loss will be reflected in the results from discontinued operations on the consolidated income statements. We continue to evaluate opportunities to manage the liabilities associated with our pension plans. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2016 and 2015, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $79.3 and $137.5, respectively. For 2017, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $65 to $85. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which 47 Table of Contents are dependent upon the timing of retirements and future cost reduction actions. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 45 for a projection of future contributions. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA: the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $27.0, $28.3, and $35.1 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $7 and $4 in 2016 and 2015, respectively, on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $3 in both 2017 and 2018. We accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $81 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $95 as of 30 September 2016. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2016 and 2015 included an accrual of $81.4 and $80.6, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and Pasadena, Texas, locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, California’s cap and trade scheme, South Korea’s Emission Trading Scheme, Alberta’s Specified Gases Emitter Regulation and, beginning in 2017, the Ontario cap and trade scheme and China National Emission Trading Scheme. Where these regulations impose compliance costs on our hydrogen production facilities (California, Alberta, and Ontario), we have been able to mitigate the majority of such costs through our contractual terms. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on us. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. We are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In 48 Table of Contents addition, the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. We are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating in the industrial gas business. In 2015, we entered into a long-term sale of equipment contract to engineer, procure, and construct industrial gas facilities with a 25% owned joint venture for Saudi Aramco’s Jazan oil refinery and power plant in Saudi Arabia. The agreement included terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party. Sales related to this contract are included in the results of our Industrial Gases – Global segment and were approximately $300 during fiscal year 2016 and were not material during fiscal year 2015. INFLATION We operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management’s significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2016 totaled $8,852.7, and depreciation expense totaled $893.0 during 2016. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. The regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset. Our regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are 49 Table of Contents generally 15 years. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Materials Technologies segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional Industrial Gases segments and Materials Technologies segment would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease Life Increase Life By 1 Year By 1 Year Industrial Gases – Regional $36 $(31) Materials Technologies $4 $(3) Impairment of Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. On 29 March 2016, the Board of Directors approved the Company’s exit of its Energy-from-Waste business. Accordingly, we assessed the recoverability of capital costs for the two projects associated with this business and recorded an impairment charge of $913.5 to reduce the carrying values of plant assets to their estimated net realizable value of $20. We estimated the net realizable value of the projects assuming an orderly liquidation of assets capable of being marketed on a secondary equipment market based on market quotes and our experience with selling similar equipment. An asset’s orderly liquidation value is the amount that could be realized from a liquidation sale, given a reasonable period of time to find a buyer, selling the asset in the existing condition where it is located, and assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. The valuation includes inputs that are unobservable and therefore considered Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. The loss was measured as the difference between the orderly liquidation value of the assets and the net book value of the assets. Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, for additional information. There have been no significant changes in the estimated net realizable value as of 30 September 2016. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable 50 Table of Contents intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $1,150.2 as of 30 September 2016. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements. We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for more frequent testing. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. As of 30 September 2016, we had six business segments and thirteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each business segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the three regional Industrial Gases segments and the Materials Technologies segment. As part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a two-step quantitative test is required. We chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing, as further described below. The first step of the quantitative test requires that we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value, including assigned goodwill. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates. If our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in an analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. In 2014, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing as of 1 July 2014 and concluded that the goodwill associated with the Latin America reporting unit was impaired and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $305.2. The Latin America reporting unit is composed predominately of our Indura business with business units in Chile, Colombia, and other Latin America countries, which the Company acquired in 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing noting no indications of impairment. The fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. The excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units ranged from approximately 30% to approximately 350%. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of 51 Table of Contents these reporting units. In this scenario, the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 15% to 300%. Future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges. We will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results or changes in management’s business outlook or strategy. Intangible Assets Intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 September 2016 totaled $425.3 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2016 totaled $62.7 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we conducted our annual impairment test and determined that our indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. Refer to Note 11, Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles and found no indications of impairment. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,288.1 at 30 September 2016. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Revenue Recognition- Percentage-of-Completion Method Revenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, revenue from the sale of major equipment, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) heat exchangers and large air separation units, is recognized based on labor hours or costs incurred to date compared with total estimated labor hours or costs to be incurred, depending on the nature of the project and the best measure of progress toward completion. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete the contract and recognize the profit over the life of the contract. Accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors 52 Table of Contents such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule and technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs or labor hours are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. Our Jazan large air separation unit sale of equipment project within our Industrial Gases – Global segment spans several years. In addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities, this project requires monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. Given the revenue and cost uncertainties associated with these risks, we recognized revenue and cost with no estimated profit through the third quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of progress toward completion and a reassessment of revenue and cost risks, we changed our estimated profit on the project and recognized the inception-to-date effect of that change associated with approximately $300 of revenue. Changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method, including the Jazan project, favorably impacted operating income by approximately $20 in fiscal year 2016, primarily during the fourth quarter. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years. Changes in estimates during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were not significant. We assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. At 30 September 2016, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $146.6 and $574.4, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2016 were $106.9, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the year ended 30 September 2016 was $586.5. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 23, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease/increase net income by approximately $21. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. 53 Table of Contents Actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. In fiscal year 2016, the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation and benefit costs for the U.S. plans reflect the adoption of the new Society of Actuaries RP-2014 mortality table projected with Scale BB-2D. As of 30 September 2016, the projected benefit obligation reflects the adoption of the new mortality projection scale MP-2016 for the U.S. plans. Our mortality assumptions will differ from the IRS mortality assumptions used to determine funding valuations, as the IRS is not expected to adopt the new tables until 2018 or later. One of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. Effective in 2016, the Company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs. The Company has accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. This rate will change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $33 per year. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $19 per year. We use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. For equities, this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets. The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $16 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business we encounter contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within 54 Table of Contents this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE As of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we adopted guidance on the presentation of deferred income taxes that resulted in all deferred tax liabilities and assets being classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Accordingly, prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The guidance, which did not change the existing requirement to net deferred tax assets and liabilities within a jurisdiction, resulted in a reclassification adjustment that increased noncurrent deferred tax assets by $13.7 and decreased noncurrent deferred tax liabilities by $99.9 as of 30 September 2015. See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains “forward-looking statements” within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about business outlook. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this report. Actual performance and financial results may differ materially from projections and estimates expressed in the forward-looking statements because of many factors not anticipated by management, including, without limitation, global or regional economic conditions and supply and demand dynamics in market segments into which the Company sells; significant fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies from that currently anticipated; future financial and operating performance of major customers; unanticipated contract terminations or customer cancellations or postponement of projects and sales; asset impairments due to economic conditions or specific customer or other events; the impact of competitive products and pricing; ability to protect and enforce the Company’s intellectual property rights; unexpected changes in raw material supply and markets; the impact of price fluctuations in natural gas and disruptions in markets and the economy due to oil price volatility; the ability to recover increased energy and raw material costs from customers; costs and outcomes of litigation or regulatory investigations; the success of productivity and cost reduction programs; the timing, impact, and other uncertainties of future acquisitions or divestitures; political risks, including the risks of unanticipated government actions; acts of war or terrorism; the impact of changes in environmental, tax or other legislation and regulatory activities in jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate; and other risk factors described in Section 1A, Risk Factors. The Company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this document to reflect any change in the Company’s assumptions, beliefs or expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances upon which any such forward-looking statements are based. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital. We address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into 55 Table of Contents transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies, see Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases. Our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in Note 14, Fair Value Measurements, to the consolidated financial statements. At 30 September 2016 and 2015, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $5,187.7 and $4,452.0, respectively. The increase in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt by Versum, which included senior unsecured notes ($425.0) and a fully drawn term loan facility ($575.0). The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities) as of the valuation date. Interest Rate Risk Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2016, including the effect of currency swap agreements, primarily comprised debt denominated in U.S. dollars (37%) and Euros (33%). This debt portfolio is composed of 53% fixed-rate debt and 47% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position. The sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2016, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $161 and $139 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2016 and 2015, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $178 and $151 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2016 and 2015, respectively. Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $29 and $30 of interest incurred per year at the end of 30 September 2016 and 2015, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $29 and $30 per year at 30 September 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2016 and 2015, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $438 and $421 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2016 and 2015, respectively. The primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are Euros and U.S. dollars and British Pound Sterling and U.S. dollars. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset/liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis. 56 Table of Contents The majority of the Company’s sales are derived from outside of the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. Financial results therefore will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Euro and the Chinese Renminbi represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Euro or the Chinese Renminbi versus the U.S. dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $20 and $15, respectively. 57 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:42:28.117010
