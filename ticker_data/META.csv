1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2013,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics."" Overview Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. Facebook enables you to express yourself and connect with the world around you instantly and freely. We build products that support our mission by creating utility for users, developers, and marketers: Users. We enable people who use Facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about. Developers. We enable developers to use the Facebook Platform to build applications (apps) and websites that integrate with Facebook to reach our global network of users and to build products that are more personalized and social. Marketers. We enable marketers to engage with more than one billion monthly active users (MAUs) on Facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. We offer marketers a unique combination of reach, relevance, social context, and engagement to enhance the value of their ads. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our Payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our Platform developers. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded revenue of $5.09 billion, income from operations of $538 million and net income of $53 million. Total costs and expenses increased 133% compared to revenue growth of 37% due to significant increases in share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses for restricted stock units (RSUs) and increases in headcount for the year ended December 31, 2012. During fiscal 2012, we recognized $1.72 billion of share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses. Of these amounts, $1.13 billion was due to the recognition of share-based compensation and related payroll tax expenses related to RSUs granted prior to January 1, 2011 (Pre-2011 RSUs) triggered by the completion of our initial public offering (IPO) in May 2012. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 has exceeded the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and losses arising outside the United States in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit.Trends in Our User Metrics The numbers of MAUs, DAUs, and mobile MAUs discussed below, as well as average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include Instagram users unless such users would otherwise qualify as MAUs, DAUs and/or mobile MAUs based on activity that is shared back to Facebook.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website that is integrated with Facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community, which has grown substantially in the past several years. 36Note: For purposes of reporting MAUs, DAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey, Asia includes all users in Australia and New Zealand, and Rest of World includes Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. In June 2012, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the first quarter of 2012. While this issue did not affect our overall worldwide MAU number, it did affect our attribution of users to different geographic regions. The first quarter of 2012 user metrics as pictured in the charts above reflect the reclassification to more correctly attribute users by geographic region.As of December 31, 2012, we had 1.06 billion MAUs, an increase of 25% from December 31, 2011. Users in Brazil, India and Indonesia represented key sources of growth in fiscal 2012 relative to the prior year. We had 67 million MAUs in Brazil as of December 31, 2012, an increase of 81% compared to the same period in 2011; we had 71 million MAUs in India as of December 31, 2012, an increase of 54% compared to the same period in 2011; and we had 60 million MAUs in Indonesia as of December 31, 2012, an increase of 25% compared to the same period in 2011. Additionally, we had 174 million MAUs in the United States as of December 31, 2012, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2011. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website that is integrated with Facebook, on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement. 37 Note: For non-worldwide DAU user numbers presented for the periods marked March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, the figures represent an average of the first 25 days of the former period and the last 27 days of the latter period in order to avoid using data subject to the algorithm error described in the MAU section above. These average numbers do not meaningfully differ from the average numbers when calculated over a full month.Worldwide DAUs increased 28% to 618 million on average during December 2012 from 483 million during December 2011. We experienced growth in DAUs across major markets including Brazil, India and Japan. Overall growth in DAUs was driven largely by increased mobile usage of Facebook. Relative to September 30, 2012, DAUs increased from 584 million to 618 million, due to an increase in mobile users. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the number of DAUs using personal computers declined modestly compared to the third quarter of 2012, including declines in key markets such as the United States, while mobile DAUs continued to increase. 38•Mobile MAUs. We define a mobile MAU as a user who accessed Facebook via a mobile app or via mobile-optimized versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet such as the iPad, during the period of measurement. Worldwide mobile MAUs increased 57% to 680 million as of December 31, 2012 from 432 million as of December 31, 2011. In all regions, an increasing number of our MAUs are accessing Facebook through mobile devices, with users in the United States, India and Brazil representing key sources of mobile growth over the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2012. Approximately 157 million mobile MAUs accessed Facebook solely through mobile apps or our mobile website during the month ended December 31, 2012, increasing 25% from 126 million during the month ended September 30, 2012. The remaining 523 million mobile MAUs accessed Facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during that month. While most of our mobile users also access Facebook through personal computers, we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will exceed the growth in usage through personal computers for the foreseeable future and that the usage through personal computers may be flat or continue to decline in certain markets, including key developed markets such as the United States, in part due to our focus on developing mobile products to encourage mobile usage of Facebook. 39Trends in Our Monetization by User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual goods are purchased. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. Annual ARPU is the sum of respective quarterly ARPU amounts in that year. Our revenue and ARPU in markets such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users. Note: Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the advertiser or developer. In June 2012, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter of 2012 ARPU amount for the United States & Canada region reflects an adjustment based on the reclassification to more correctly attribute users by geographic region. The amounts above for the fourth quarter of 2012 include a one-time increase in Payments revenue as described in Results of Operations.40For 2012, worldwide ARPU was $5.32, an increase of 6% from 2011. ARPU increased in 2012 by approximately 20% in the United States & Canada and Rest of World, by approximately 15% in Asia and 8% in Europe compared to 2011. During the fourth quarter of 2012, worldwide ARPU was $1.54, an increase of 12% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Over this period, ARPU increased by approximately 37% in Rest of World, by over 20% in United States & Canada and Asia, and by approximately 7% in Europe. User growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will continue to be higher in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such as Asia and Rest of World, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region. We also expect worldwide ARPU will decline in the first quarter of 2013 driven by seasonality, which is consistent with historical trends.Factors Affecting Our Performance Number of MAUs and DAUs. Trends in our MAUs and DAUs affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. In 2012, MAUs increased by 25% and DAUs increased by 28%. We expect our growth rates for MAUs and DAUs to decline as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates. Additionally, as we grow our business and expand internationally, we expect to face challenges entering new markets such as China, where access to Facebook is restricted in whole or in part. As user growth rates slow, we expect the rate of growth in revenue will likely decline over time, which will affect our income from operations and net income. User Geography. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. For example, ARPU for an average user in United States & Canada is more than five times higher than for an average user in Asia. User geography also has some impact on our costs, though in general new users in Asia and Rest of World do not require material incremental infrastructure investments because we are able to utilize existing infrastructure such as our data centers in the United States to make our products available to these users. In addition, user growth by geography does not necessarily affect our overall headcount requirements or headcount-related expenses since we are generally able to support users in all geographies from our existing facilities. In 2012, we grew users relatively faster in Asia and Rest of World where on average users generate less revenue as compared with users in the United States or Europe. In the future, we expect to continue to grow more rapidly in Asia and Rest of World markets where our current penetration rates are lower. We plan to continue to invest in user growth across the world, including in geographies where current per user monetization is relatively lower. User Engagement. Changes in user engagement as measured by metrics such as frequency of visitation will also affect our revenue and financial performance. Growth in user engagement should generally increase the opportunities for us to display advertising and to deliver relevant commercial content to users. Growth in user engagement also generally results in increases in our expenses and capital expenditures required to support user activity. User engagement as measured by DAUs as a percentage of MAUs increased from 57% at the end of 2011 to 59% at the end of 2012. Our product development investments are focused on increasing user engagement over time. Facebook Usage on Mobile Devices. Increasing Facebook use on mobile devices may affect our revenue and financial results as we currently show fewer ads on average to mobile users compared to users on personal computers. The lower volume of ads per mobile user is partially offset by the higher price per ad for mobile, and we are investing to try to make our mobile ads more valuable over time. In 2012, we began showing ads in mobile users' News Feeds, and for the fourth quarter of 2012 and for the year ended December 31, 2012, we estimate that approximately 23% and 11% of our ads revenue came from mobile products, respectively. We expect mobile usage to increase at a faster rate than usage through personal computers for the foreseeable future, particularly in developed markets, and our success in ramping up mobile monetization will likely have a material impact on our financial performance. Value of Our Advertising Products. We believe that increasing the value of our advertising products and the consequent return on investment to marketers from working with Facebook will increase marketer demand and thereby increase the amount marketers spend with us. We aim to increase the value of our advertising products through such means as increasing the size and engagement of our user base, improving our ability to select relevant advertising content for each user, developing new ads formats and products, and improving the measurement tools available to marketers to optimize their campaigns. For example, in 2012, we launched advertising in News Feed and Custom Audiences in order to enable marketers to more effectively reach their target customers. Management of Ad Inventory. Our revenue trends are also affected by ad inventory management changes affecting the number, size, or prominence of ads we display. For example, in 2012 we began showing ads in News Feed. These News Feed ads are displayed more prominently and we receive a higher price per ad compared to ads displayed on the right hand column of our web page. Product Innovation. We make ongoing product changes intended to enhance the user experience and increase user engagement. For example, in 2012, we launched new versions of our iPhone app that are faster and more reliable than the prior versions of our app. The new versions of the apps significantly increased News Feed loads and user feedback shared. Our new products often also increase costs if they require additional compute power and infrastructure.41Investment in Infrastructure. Our investments in the scope, reliability, redundancy, and efficiency of our infrastructure affects our expenses and capital expenditures. In 2012, we continued to make significant investments in our technical infrastructure to ensure that our growing user base can access Facebook rapidly and reliably, by expanding the capacity of our data centers in Prineville, Oregon and Forest City, North Carolina and by initiating construction of a new data center project in Lulea, Sweden. We also invested in hardware and software efficiency projects to improve the performance of our infrastructure. Investment in Talent. As of December 31, 2012, we had 4,619 employees, an increase of 44% from the end of 2011. Our employee headcount has increased significantly and we expect headcount growth to continue in 2013 as we ramp up our investment in technical staff, sales and marketing, and general and administrative personnel. We have also made and intend to make acquisitions with the primary objective of adding software engineers, product designers, and other personnel with certain technology expertise. Business Development and Acquisitions. As part of our business strategy, we periodically make acquisitions to add specialized employees, complementary companies, products, technologies, or other assets. For example, in 2012, we acquired Instagram, Inc. and certain AOL patent assets from Microsoft Corporation. Our acquisitions will affect our future financial results due to factors such as the amortization of acquired intangible assets and may also result in potential charges such as restructuring costs or impairment expense. Geographic Earnings Mix. In 2012, our tax rate was 89%, up from 41% in 2011, primarily due to significant amounts of share-based compensation expense being allocated to our international subsidiaries in low tax jurisdictions, leading to non-deductible losses in those subsidiaries. Our future tax rate and financial results will be affected by the relative profitability of our corporate entities in higher versus lower tax jurisdictions.Seasonality. Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 46%, 18%, and 22% between the third and fourth quarters of 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2011 and 2012 declined 3% and 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2011, respectively. Share-based Compensation Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized $1.57 billion of share-based compensation expense. Of these amounts, $1.04 billion was due to the recognition of share-based compensation related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012. As of December 31, 2012, there was $2.21 billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense, of which $1.96 billion is related to RSUs and $244 million is related to restricted shares and stock options. This unrecognized share-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition for Payments and Other Fees We enable Payments from our users to our Platform developers. Our users can make payments on the Facebook Platform by using credit cards or other payment methods available on our website. The primary process for these transactions is through the purchase of our virtual currency. Our users then use this virtual currency to purchase virtual and digital goods in games and apps from developers on the Facebook Platform. Upon the initial sale of the virtual currency, we record consideration received from a user as a deposit. When a user engages in a payment transaction utilizing the virtual currency for the purchase of a virtual or digital good from a 42Platform developer, we reduce the virtual currency balance of the user by the price of the purchase, which is a price that is solely determined by the Platform developer. We remit to the Platform developer an amount that is based on the total amount of virtual currency redeemed less the processing fee that we charge the Platform developer for the service performed. Our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction. We record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the user. Under GAAP guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent, the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment. We consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts. Should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with Platform developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales, we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the Platform developers as an associated cost. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Share-based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2011 we granted Pre-2011 RSUs to our employees and members of our board of directors that vested upon the satisfaction of both a service-based condition, generally over four years, and a liquidity condition. The liquidity condition was satisfied in connection with our IPO in May 2012. Because the liquidity condition was not satisfied until our IPO, in prior periods we had not recorded any expense relating to the granting of the Pre-2011 RSUs. In the second quarter of 2012, we recognized $986 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with Pre-2011 RSUs that vested in connection with our IPO. For the Pre-2011 RSUs, we recognize share-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. RSUs granted on or after January 1, 2011 (Post-2011 RSUs) are not subject to a liquidity condition in order to vest, and compensation expense related to these grants is based on the grant date fair value of the RSUs and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable service period. The majority of Post-2011 RSUs are earned over a service period of four to five years. For Post-2011 RSUs, which are only subject to a service condition, we recognize share-based compensation expense on a ratable basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.We account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and RSUs, to be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those share-based awards that we expect to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any. We will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates. We have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies. As these awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition share-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight-line basis over the employee's required service period. We capitalize share-based employee compensation expense when appropriate. We did not capitalize any share-based compensation 43expense in the three years ended December 31, 2012. Loss Contingencies We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of December 31, 2012. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting operating unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment under the new authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step will be performed; otherwise, no further step is required. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. Any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. As of December 31, 2012, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our amortizable intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.Components of Results of OperationsRevenueWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our Payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our Platform developers.Advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the Facebook website or mobile app and third-party affiliated websites or mobile apps. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of clicks made by our users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. Whether we count the initial display only or every display of an ad as an impression is dependent on where the ad is displayed. For example, an individual ad in News Feed that is purchased on an impression basis may be displayed to users more than once during a day; however, only the initial display of the ad is considered an impression, regardless of how many times the ad is actually displayed within the News Feed.44Payments and other fees. We enable Payments from our users to our Platform developers. Our users can transact and make payments on the Facebook Platform by using credit cards, PayPal or other payment methods available on our website. We receive a fee from our Platform developers when users make purchases from our Platform developers using our Payments infrastructure. We recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our Platform developers. We have mandated the use of our Payments infrastructure for game apps on Facebook, and fees related to Payments are generated almost exclusively from games. Cumulatively to date, games from Zynga have generated the majority of our payments and other fees revenue. However, Zynga's contribution to our payments and other fees revenue has decreased over time and this trend may continue. Our other fees revenue consists primarily of user Promoted Posts and, to a lesser extent, Facebook Gifts revenue, and has been immaterial in recent periods.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. Cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. Marketing and sales. Our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include user-, developer-, and advertiser-facing marketing and promotional expenditures.General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. General and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of patents we acquired.We have reclassified certain prior period expense amounts from marketing and sales to general and administrative within our consolidated statements of income to conform to our current year presentation. These reclassifications did not affect previously reported revenue, total costs and expenses, income from operations, or net income in our consolidated statements of income.Results of Operations The following table set forth our consolidated statements of income data: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in millions)Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue$5,089 $3,711 $1,974Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue1,364 860 493Research and development1,399 388 144Marketing and sales896 393 167General and administrative892 314 138Total costs and expenses4,551 1,955 942Income from operations538 1,756 1,032Interest and other income (expense), net(44) (61) (24)Income before provision for income taxes494 1,695 1,008Provision for income taxes441 695 402Net income $53 $1,000 $60645Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in millions)Cost of revenue$88 $9 $—Research and development843 114 9Marketing and sales306 37 2General and administrative335 57 9Total share-based compensation expense$1,572 $217 $20 The following table set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue100 % 100 % 100 %Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue27 23 25Research and development27 10 7Marketing and sales18 11 8General and administrative18 8 7Total costs and expenses89 53 48Income from operations11 47 52Interest and other income (expense), net(1) (2) (1)Income before provision for income taxes10 46 51Provision for income taxes9 19 20Net income 1 % 27 % 31 %Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010Cost of revenue2% —% —%Research and development17 3 —Marketing and sales6 1 —General and administrative7 2 —Total share-based compensation expense31% 6% 1% 46Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2011 to 2012% Change 2010 to 2011% Change 2012 2011 2010 (in millions) Advertising$4,279 $3,154 $1,868 36% 69%Payments and other fees810 557 106 45% 425%Total revenue$5,089 $3,711 $1,974 37% 88% 2012 Compared to 2011. Revenue in 2012 increased $1.38 billion, or 37% compared to 2011. The increase was due primarily to a 36% increase in advertising revenue during 2012 as compared to 2011. Advertising revenue grew due to a 32% increase in the number of ads delivered during 2012 and to a 3% increase in the average price per ad. The increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth. MAUs grew 25% from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 and average DAUs grew 28% from December 2011 to December 2012. Various product changes and changes in user engagement generally offset in their impact on the average number of ads per user. For example, the shift to greater mobile use generally reduced ads per user, while the introduction of ads in News Feed increased the number of ads per user. The rate of change in number of ads delivered also differs by geography, driven by factors such as mobile penetration. For example, Europe and Rest of World increased at a faster rate than the United States and Asia. Growth in the average price per ad during 2012 compared to 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in price per ad in the United States, which benefited from growth in ads in News Feed across desktop and mobile devices. Ads in News Feed have a significantly higher average price per ad due to factors which include the prominent position of the ads. The increase in price per ad in the United States was partially offset by an increased percentage of our worldwide ads being delivered in the Asia and Rest of World geographies where the average price per ad, while growing on a year-over-year basis, is relatively lower. The average price per ad was also affected by a decline in the average price per ad in Europe in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, an increase in the percentage of ads being delivered in European regions where the average price per ads is relatively lower, and in part, we believe, to continuing weak economic conditions in that region affecting advertiser demand.For the year ended December 31, 2012, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue as a percentage of advertising revenue was approximately 11%. As mobile advertising was not offered prior to the first quarter of 2012, comparisons to prior year are not meaningful.Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 41% compared to the same period in 2011, due to a 46% increase in the number of ads delivered, partially offset by a 4% decrease in the average price per ad. The increase in ads delivered was driven by user growth and certain product changes, including the addition of News Feed ads on personal computers and mobile devices. MAUs grew 25% from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 and average DAUs grew 28% from December 2011 to December 2012. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we lowered our market reserve price (i.e. the minimum price threshold accepted in our ads auction), and this product change had the effect of increasing the number of ads delivered and decreasing the average price per ad. This change primarily affected the Rest of World and Asia markets where the average price per ad is relatively lower, and the change increased the percentage of our ads that are shown in relatively lower priced markets, which has the effect of decreasing the overall average price per ad. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue as a percentage of advertising revenue was approximately 23%.Payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased $253 million, or 45%, compared to 2011. Excluding the one-time increase in Payments revenue described below, Payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased 34% compared to 2011. Facebook Payments became mandatory for all game developers accepting payments on the Facebook Platform with limited exceptions on July 1, 2011. Accordingly, comparisons of Payments and other fees revenue to periods before this date may not be meaningful.Payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $256 million. Comparisons to prior periods are not meaningful due to the one-time increase in Payments revenue described below. Our Payments terms and conditions provide for a 30-day claim period subsequent to a Payments transaction during which the customer may dispute the virtual or digital goods transaction. Through the third quarter of 2012, we had deferred recognition of Payments revenue until the expiration of this period as we were unable to make reasonable and reliable estimates of future refunds or chargebacks arising during this claim period, due to lack of historical transactional information. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had 24 months of historical transactional information which enabled us to estimate future refunds and chargebacks. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded all Payments revenues at the time of the purchase of the related 47virtual or digital goods, net of estimated refunds or chargebacks. This change resulted in a one-time increase in Payments revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $66 million as we recognized revenue from four months of transactions.Seven and nine percent of our total revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2012, respectively and 11% and 12% of our total revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011, respectively, came from a single customer, Zynga. Revenue from Zynga consisted of payments processing fees related to their sale of virtual goods and from direct advertising purchased by Zynga. In 2012, we generated approximately 51% of our revenue from marketers and Platform developers based in the United States, compared to 56% in 2011. The change is due primarily to a faster growth rate of international users and, to a lesser extent, to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods. The majority of our revenue outside of the United States came from customers located in western Europe, Canada, Australia and Brazil.2011 Compared to 2010. Revenue in 2011 increased $1.74 billion, or 88% compared to 2010. The increase was due primarily to a 69% increase in advertising revenue to $3.15 billion. Advertising revenue grew due to a 42% increase in the number of ads delivered and an 18% increase in the average price per ad delivered. The increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth; MAUs grew 39% from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 and average DAUs grew 48% from December 2010 to December 2011. The number of ads delivered was also affected by many other factors including product changes that significantly increased the number of ads on many Facebook pages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by an increase in usage of our mobile products, where we did not show ads, and by various product changes implemented in 2011 that in aggregate modestly reduced the number of ads on certain pages. The increase in average price per ad delivered was affected by factors including improvements in our ability to deliver more relevant ads to users and product changes that contributed to higher user interaction with the ads by increasing their relative prominence. Payments and other fees revenue increased to $557 million in 2011 due to the adoption of Facebook Payments, which has been gradually adopted by our Platform developers and began generating significant revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010. Facebook Payments became mandatory for all game developers accepting payments on the Facebook Platform with limited exceptions on July 1, 2011. Accordingly, comparisons of payments and other fees revenue to periods before that date may not be meaningful. In 2011, other fees revenue was immaterial. In 2011, we generated approximately 56% of our revenue from marketers and Platform developers based in the United States, compared to 62% in 2010. This change is due to factors including a faster growth rate of international users and the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods. The majority of our revenue outside of the United States came from customers located in western Europe, Canada, and Australia. Cost of revenue Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012% Change 2010 to 2011% Change (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue$1,364 $860 $493 59% 74%Percentage of revenue27% 23% 25% 2012 Compared to 2011. Cost of revenue in 2012 increased $504 million, or 59%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to expenses related to expanding our data center operations, including a $257 million increase in depreciation in 2012. Share-based compensation expense increased by $79 million in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Increases in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 65% increase in employee headcount also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue in 2012. These expenses supported our user growth, the increased usage of products by users, developers, and marketers, and the launch of new products.2011 Compared to 2010. Cost of revenue in 2011 increased $367 million, or 74%, compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to expenses related to expanding our data center operations, including a $164 million increase in depreciation and a $35 million increase in data center facility rent. These expenses supported our user growth, the increased usage of our products by users, developers, and marketers, and the launch of new products. Additionally, credit card and other related revenue processing fees increased by $60 million. We anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future as we expand our data center 48capacity to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and offerings. The expected increase in cost of revenue may be partially mitigated to the extent we are able to realize improvements in server performance and the efficiency of our technical operations. We expect cost of revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2013 compared to 2012 due to our investment in technical infrastructure. Research and development Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012% Change 2010 to 2011% Change (dollars in millions) Research and development$1,399 $388 $144 261% 169%Percentage of revenue27% 10% 7% 2012 Compared to 2011. Research and development expenses in 2012 increased $1.01 billion, or 261%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $729 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 73% growth in employee headcount in engineering, design, product management, and other technical functions. This investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users, developers, and marketers.2011 Compared to 2010. Research and development expenses in 2011 increased $244 million, or 169%, compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase from $9 million in 2010 to $114 million in 2011 for share-based compensation expense related to Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 57% growth in employee headcount in engineering, design, product management, and other technical functions. This investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users, developers, and marketers. In 2013, we plan to continue rapidly hiring engineering, design, product management, and other technical employees. However, we expect research and development expenses will rise in 2013 at a lower rate than it rose in 2012 due to the large share-based compensation expense in the second quarter of 2012 associated with Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO.Marketing and sales Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012% Change 2010 to 2011% Change (dollars in millions) Marketing and sales896 393 167 128% 135%Percentage of revenue18% 11% 8% 2012 Compared to 2011. Marketing and sales expenses in 2012 increased $503 million, or 128%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $269 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expenses also increased due to a 19% increase in employee headcount to support global sales, business development and customer service. An increase in our user-, developer-, and advertiser-facing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2012.2011 Compared to 2010. Marketing and sales expenses in 2011 increased $226 million, or 135%, compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 45% increase in employee headcount to support global sales, business development, and customer service, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in our user-, developer-, and advertiser-facing marketing. Additionally, share-based compensation expense increased from $2 million in 2010 to $37 million in 2011 due to recognition of expense related to Post-2011 RSUs.In 2013, we plan to add sales, business development and customer service employees, and increase our investment in user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing. However, we expect marketing and sales expenses will rise in 2013 at a lower rate than it rose in 2012 due to the large share-based compensation expense in the second quarter of 2012 associated with Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO.49General and administrative Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012% Change 2010 to 2011% Change (dollars in millions) General and administrative$892 $314 $138 184% 128%Percentage of revenue18% 8% 7% 2012 Compared to 2011. General and administrative expenses in 2012 increased $578 million, or 184%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $278 million resulting from recognition of expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. The increase was also due to growth in legal fees and settlement costs, amortization of acquired patents and other professional service fees. Payroll and benefits expenses also increased for 2012 due to a 38% increase in employee headcount in corporate communications and policy, human resources, legal, finance, and other functions.2011 Compared to 2010. General and administrative expenses in 2011 increased $176 million, or 128%, compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 60% increase in employee headcount in finance, legal, human resources, and other functions. Additionally, outside consulting and legal fees contributed to the increase. Share-based compensation expense increased from $9 million in 2010 to $57 million in 2011 due to recognition of expense related to Post-2011 RSUs.In 2013, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support our growth. However, we expect general and administrative expenses will rise in 2013 at a lower rate than it rose in 2012 due to the large share-based compensation expense in the second quarter of 2012 associated with Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO. Interest and other income (expense), net Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012% Change 2010 to 2011% Change (in millions) Interest expense$(51) $(42) $(22) 21 % 91%Other income (expense), net7 (19) (2) (137)% 850%Interest and other income (expense), net$(44) $(61) $(24) (28)% 154% 2012 Compared to 2011. Interest and other income (expense), net in 2012 decreased $17 million, or 28%, compared to 2011. Interest expense increased by $9 million primarily due to an increased volume of property and equipment financed by capital leases for 2012 and interest on the $1.5 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012. Changes in other income (expense), net were primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses in 2012 resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances and an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances.2011 Compared to 2010. Interest and other income (expense), net in 2011 increased $37 million, or 154%, compared to 2010. Interest expense increased by $20 million, driven by an increase in fees related to our credit facility as described in ""—Liquidity and Capital Resources,"" and the payments related to an increased volume of property and equipment financed by capital leases. The change in other income (expense), net was primarily due to $29 million in foreign exchange related losses in 2011. Foreign exchange losses in 2011 stemmed from the periodic re-measurement of our intercompany Euro balances. Foreign currency balances were immaterial in 2010. These expenses were partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by larger invested cash balances. 50Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012% Change 2010 to 2011% Change (dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes$441 $695 $402 (37)% 73%Effective tax rate89% 41% 40% 2012 Compared to 2011. Our provision for income taxes in 2012 decreased $254 million, or 37%, compared to 2011, primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and the losses arising outside the United States in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate in 2012 was also higher due to the expiration of the federal tax credit for research and development activities.On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted, which includes a reinstatement of the federal research and development credit for the tax year ended December 31, 2012. We estimate that our tax credit for 2012 would have been approximately $80 million to $120 million, which we will record as a discrete benefit in the first quarter of 2013.2011 Compared to 2010. Our provision for income taxes in 2011 increased $293 million, or 73%, compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to losses arising outside the United States in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit and the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation expense during the year. 51 Quarterly Results of Operations Data The following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2012.

This charge resulted in a one-time increase in Payment revenue of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.(2)In the second quarter of 2012, we recognized $986 million of share-based compensation expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs that vested in connection with our IPO.52 Three Months Ended Dec 31, 2012 Sep 30, 2012 Jun 30, 2012 Mar 31, 2012 Dec 31, 2011 Sep 30, 2011 Jun 30, 2011 Mar 31, 2011 (as a percentage of total revenue)Consolidated Statements of Operations Data: Revenue: Advertising revenue84% 86 % 84 % 82% 83% 84% 87% 87%Payments and other fees revenue16 14 16 18 17 16 13 13Total revenue100% 100 % 100 % 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue25 26 31 26 22 25 23 23Research and development19 19 60 14 11 11 11 8Marketing and sales12 13 33 14 11 12 11 8General and administrative11 12 39 10 8 9 9 8Total costs and expenses67 70 163 64 52 57 55 47Income (loss) from operations33 30 (63) 36 48 43 45 53Income (loss) before (provision for) benefit from income taxes32 29 (65) 36 46 40 45 54Net income (loss)4% (5)% (13)% 19% 27% 24% 27% 32%Net income (loss) attributable to Class A and Class B common stockholders4% (5)% (13)% 13% 18% 16% 18% 21%Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Three Months Ended Dec 31, 2012 Sep 30, 2012 Jun 30, 2012 Mar 31, 2012 Dec 31, 2011 Sep 30, 2011 Jun 30, 2011 Mar 31, 2011 (as a percentage of total revenue)Cost of revenue1% 1% 6% — % — % — % — % — %Research and development8 9 46 6 4 3 4 1Marketing and sales2 2 20 2 1 1 1 —General and administrative2 2 22 2 2 2 2 —Total share-based compensation expense12% 14% 93% 10% 7% 7% 7% 1% 53Liquidity and Capital Resources Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in millions)Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: Net cash provided by operating activities$1,612 $1,549 $698Net cash used in investing activities(7,024) (3,023) (324)Net cash provided by financing activities6,283 1,198 781Purchases of property and equipment(1,235) (606) (293)Depreciation and amortization649 323 139Share-based compensation1,572 217 20Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds and U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $9.63 billion as of December 31, 2012, an increase of $5.72 billion from December 31, 2011. The most significant cash flow activities consisted of $6.8 billion of net proceeds from our IPO, which was completed in May 2012, $1.61 billion of cash generated from operations, $1.5 billion of loan draw down and $1.03 billion in excess tax benefit from share-based award activity, offset by $2.86 billion of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of RSUs when the Pre-2011 RSUs vested and settled in the fourth quarter of 2012, $1.24 billion used for capital expenditures and $911 million used for acquisitions of businesses and other assets. If we continue to net settle RSUs, we will use additional cash to pay employees' tax withholding obligations in connection with such settlements. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. In February 2012, we entered into an agreement for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $5 billion for general corporate purposes, with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.0%. Under the terms of the agreement, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee of 0.10% per annum on the daily undrawn balance. No amounts were drawn down under this credit facility as of December 31, 2012.Concurrent with our entering into the revolving credit facility, we also entered into a bridge credit facility agreement that allowed us to borrow up to $3 billion to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of RSUs in connection with our IPO. In October 2012, we amended and restated our bridge credit facility, converting it to an unsecured term loan facility (Amended and Restated Term Loan) that allowed us to borrow up to $1.5 billion to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of RSUs in connection with our IPO, with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at LIBOR plus 1.0%. We paid origination fees at closing of the Amended and Restated Term Loan, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. We drew down the $1.5 billion of the Amended and Restated Term Loan in October 2012 and paid an upfront fee of 0.15% on the loan amount, which fee is being amortized over the remaining term of the facility. Any amounts outstanding will become due and payable on October 25, 2015.In connection with the draw down of the Amended and Restated Term Loan, to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuation, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement. The net effect of this swap agreement is to convert the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 1.46%. The interest rate swap has a maturity date of October 25, 2015. As of December 31, 2012, our income tax refundable of $451 million reflects the expected refund from income tax loss carrybacks to 2010 and 2011. We expect to receive this refund in the first six months of 2013.As of December 31, 2012, $565 million of the $9.63 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have provided for the additional taxes that would be due if we repatriated these funds for use in our operations in the United States. Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities during 2012 primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense of $1.57 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $649 million, partially offset by income tax refundable of $451 million. The cash flow from operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 increased modestly 54as the increases in adjustments for non-cash items as described above were offset by a reduction in net income of $947 million and an increase in income tax refundable.Cash flow from operating activities during 2011 primarily resulted from net income of $1 billion, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $323 million, and share-based compensation expense of $217 million.Cash flow from operating activities during 2010 primarily resulted from net income of $606 million, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $139 million and share-based compensation expense of $20 million, partially offset by cash consumed by working capital of $70 million.Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2012 primarily resulted from $4.87 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities, $1.24 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment, storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers as well as $911 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets, such as patents. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increases in the purchase of marketable securities, acquisitions of businesses and other assets, and capital expenditures.Cash used in investing activities during 2011 primarily related to the use of approximately $2.4 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities. Our cash used in investing activities in 2011 also consisted of capital expenditures of $606 million related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment, storage infrastructure, and the construction of data centers.Cash used in investing activities during 2010 primarily consisted of capital expenditures related to the purchases of property and equipment and the construction of data centers. Changes in restricted cash and deposits consumed $9 million of cash related to security deposits in support of real estate expansion in 2010. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, also consumed $22 million of cash in 2010.We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2013 of approximately $1.8 billion. Cash Provided by Financing Activities In May 2012, we received $6.8 billion in proceeds from our IPO, net of offering costs. Our financing activities have primarily consisted of equity issuances, lease financing, and debt financing. Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.28 billion and $1.2 billion, in 2012 and 2011, respectively, and included excess tax benefits from stock award activities of $1.03 billion and $433 million for the same periods, respectively. In 2012, our net cash provided by financing activities included the draw down of $1.5 billion from the Amended and Restated Term Loan. We did not have a loan draw down in 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we paid $2.86 billion of taxes related to the net settlement of RSUs when the Pre-2011 RSUs were vested and settled. In January 2011, we completed an offering of our Class A common stock to certain non-U.S. investors that generated $998 million in net proceeds. In December 2010, we completed an offering of our Class A common stock that generated $500 million in proceeds.In March 2010, we entered into a credit facility with certain lenders. This facility allowed for the draw down of up to $250 million in unsecured senior loans. In April 2010, we drew down the full amount available under the facility, and in March 2011, we repaid the entire $250 million balance.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2012. 55Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations under capital and operating leases for equipment and office and data center facilities. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2012. Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations$851 $142 $245 $212 $252Capital lease obligations979 398 403 35 143Other contractual commitments(1)749 659 71 19 —Long-term debt(2)1,562 22 1,540 — —Total contractual obligations$4,141 $1,221 $2,259 $266 $395_____________________(1)Other contractual commitments primarily relate to equipment and supplies for our data center operations, and, to a lesser extent, construction commitments related to our data center sites. (2)Long-term debt relates to the draw down of our Amended and Restated Term Loan of $1.5 billion including the estimated future interest payments using a fixed rate of 1.46%, which represented our effective interest rate after we entered into an interest rate swap agreement. In addition, our other liabilities include $100 million related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2012. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table. Contingencies We are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. Such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. See Note 10 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncement Comprehensive IncomeIn May 2011, the FASB issued guidance that changed the requirement for presenting ""Comprehensive Income"" in the consolidated financial statements. The update requires an entity to present the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. We adopted this new guidance on January 1, 2012.Goodwill Impairment Testing In September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary. An entity now has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step impairment test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this new standard on January 1, 2012 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.56Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time we do not, but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities would have on our results of operations. We recognized foreign currency losses of $9 million and $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Foreign currency losses were not significant in 2010.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest paid on our long-term debt.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds and U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $55 million and $15 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.Our long-term debt consists of the $1.5 billion draw down on our three-year unsecured term loan facility that bears variable interest at 1-month LIBOR plus 1.0%. As our risk management objective is to mitigate the risk of changes in cash flows attributable to changes in the designated 1-month LIBOR for the loan, we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement for the exact notional amount of $1.5 billion and a fixed interest rate of 1.46% at the same time the term loan was drawn down to hedge this exposure. Both the term loan and interest rate swap have a maturity date of October 25, 2015. Changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swap are expected to exactly offset the changes in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the 1-month LIBOR based interest payments on the long-term debt. The net effect of this swap agreement is to convert the variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 1.46%.Inflation RiskWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.57",2023-12-30 16:18:45.659721
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2014,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data."" Overview Our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. We build products that support our mission by creating value for users, marketers, and developers:Users. We enable people who use Facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover and learn what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about.Marketers. We enable marketers to engage with more than 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs) on Facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. We offer marketers benefits such as targeted reach, engagement, Facebook ads, Facebook ad system and ad measurement.Developers. We enable developers to use Facebook's developer services to build, grow and monetize their mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook more rapidly and successfully.We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our Payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers with applications on the Facebook website. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded revenue of $7.87 billion, income from operations of $2.8 billion and net income of $1.5 billion. 36Trends in Our User Metrics The numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (DAUs), mobile DAUs, MAUs, mobile MAUs and average revenue per user (ARPU), and certain other metric such as mobile-only DAUs and mobile-only MAUs, do not include Instagram users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. In addition, other user engagement metrics do not include Instagram unless otherwise specifically stated. Trends in the number of our users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our Messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with Facebook, on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement.Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey, Asia includes all users in Australia and New Zealand, and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 37Worldwide DAUs increased 22% to 757 million on average during December 2013 from 618 million during December 2012. We experienced growth in DAUs across major markets including Brazil, India and the United States. Overall growth in DAUs was driven largely by increased mobile usage of Facebook. The number of DAUs using personal computers decreased modestly in December 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. •Mobile DAUs. We define a mobile DAU as a user who accessed Facebook via a mobile application or via versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, on a given day. Worldwide mobile DAUs increased 49% to 556 million on average during December 2013 from 374 million during December 2012. In all regions, an increasing number of our DAUs are accessing Facebook through mobile devices, with users in Brazil, United States and India representing key sources of mobile growth on average during December 2013 as compared to the same period during 2012. There were 395 million mobile DAUs who accessed Facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website on average during the month ended December 31, 2013, increasing 65% from 240 million during the same period in 2012. The remaining 161 million mobile DAUs accessed Facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during December 2013. We anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers may be flat or decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the United States and other developed markets in Europe and Asia. 38•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our Messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with Facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community. As of December 31, 2013, we had 1.23 billion MAUs, an increase of 16% from December 31, 2012. Users in India, Brazil and Mexico represented key sources of growth in 2013 relative to the prior year.•Mobile MAUs. We define a mobile MAU as a user who accessed Facebook via a mobile application or via versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, during the period of measurement. 39Worldwide mobile MAUs increased 39% to 945 million as of December 31, 2013 from 680 million as of December 31, 2012. In all regions, an increasing number of our MAUs are accessing Facebook through mobile devices, with users in India, Brazil, and the United States representing key sources of mobile growth over the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012. There were 296 million mobile MAUs who accessed Facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website during the month ended December 31, 2013, increasing 89% from 157 million during the same period in 2012. The remaining 649 million mobile MAUs accessed Facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during December 2013. We anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers will decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the United States and other developed markets in Europe and Asia. 40Trends in Our Monetization by User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. Annual ARPU is the sum of respective quarterly ARPU amounts in that year. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users. For example, ARPU for an average user in 2013 in United States & Canada is more than five times higher than for an average user in Asia. Note: Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 41For 2013, worldwide ARPU was $6.81, an increase of 28% from 2012. Over this period, ARPU increased by approximately 43% in Rest of World, 38% in the United States & Canada, 36% in Europe and 34% in Asia. User growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will continue to be higher in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such as Asia and Rest of World, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition for Payments and Other FeesWe enable Payments from our users to developers with applications on the Facebook website. Our users can make payments on Facebook by using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards or other methods. We receive a fee from developers when a user engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the Facebook website. The price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer. We remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed. Our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction. We record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the user. Under GAAP guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent, the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment. We consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts. Should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales, we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Share-based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2011 we granted RSUs (Pre-2011 RSUs) to our employees and members of our board of directors that vested upon the satisfaction of both a service-based condition, generally over four years, and a liquidity condition. The liquidity condition was 42satisfied in connection with our IPO in May 2012. Therefore, we did not recognize any expense relating to the granting of the Pre-2011 RSUs until the completion of our IPO. For the Pre-2011 RSUs, we recognize share-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. RSUs granted on or after January 1, 2011 (Post-2011 RSUs) are not subject to a liquidity condition in order to vest, and compensation expense related to these grants is based on the grant date fair value of the RSUs and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable service period. The majority of Post-2011 RSUs are earned over a service period of four to five years. For Post-2011 RSUs, which are only subject to a service condition, we recognize share-based compensation expense on a ratable basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.We account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and RSUs, to be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those share-based awards that we expect to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any. We will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates. We have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies. As these awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition share-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight-line basis over the employee's required service period. Loss Contingencies We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. We believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of December 31, 2013. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected. Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting operating unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step will be performed; otherwise, no further step is required. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. Any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. As of December 31, 2013, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are 43expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our amortizable intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.Components of Results of OperationsRevenueWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our Payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the Facebook website.Advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the Facebook website or mobile application and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by our users, the number of actions taken by our users or the number of impressions delivered. We recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. Whether we count the initial display only or every display of an ad as an impression is dependent on where the ad is displayed. For example, an individual ad in News Feed that is purchased on an impression basis may be displayed to users more than once during a day; however, only the initial display of the ad is considered an impression, regardless of how many times the ad is actually displayed within the News Feed to a particular user. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action.Payments and other fees. We enable Payments from our users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the Facebook website. Our users can transact and make payments on the Facebook website by using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards or other methods. We receive a fee from developers when users make purchases in these applications using our Payments infrastructure. We recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. We have mandated the use of our Payments infrastructure for game applications on Facebook, and fees related to Payments are generated almost exclusively from games. Our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of user Promoted Posts and our ad serving and measurement products. Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. Cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. Marketing and sales. Our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing and promotional expenditures.General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of patents we acquired.44Results of Operations The following table set forth our consolidated statements of income data: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions)Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue$7,872 $5,089 $3,711Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue1,875 1,364 860Research and development1,415 1,399 388Marketing and sales997 896 393General and administrative781 892 314Total costs and expenses5,068 4,551 1,955Income from operations2,804 538 1,756Interest and other expense, net(50) (44) (61)Income before provision for income taxes2,754 494 1,695Provision for income taxes1,254 441 695Net income$1,500 $53 $1,000Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions)Cost of revenue$42 $88 $9Research and development604 843 114Marketing and sales133 306 37General and administrative127 335 57Total share-based compensation expense$906 $1,572 $217 The following table set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue100 % 100 % 100 %Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue24 27 23Research and development18 27 10Marketing and sales13 18 11General and administrative10 18 8Total costs and expenses64 89 53Income from operations36 11 47Interest and other expense, net(1) (1) (2)Income before provision for income taxes35 10 46Provision for income taxes16 9 19Net income19 % 1 % 27 %45Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011Cost of revenue1% 2% —%Research and development8 17 3Marketing and sales2 6 1General and administrative2 7 2Total share-based compensation expense12% 31% 6% Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2013 vs 2012% Change 2012 vs 2011% Change 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Advertising$6,986 $4,279 $3,154 63% 36%Payments and other fees886 810 557 9% 45%Total revenue$7,872 $5,089 $3,711 55% 37% 2013 Compared to 2012. Revenue in 2013 increased $2.78 billion, or 55% compared to 2012. The increase was due primarily to a 63% increase in advertising revenue during 2013 as compared to 2012. The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. News Feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. In 2013, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 45% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 11% in 2012. Other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2013 included an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory, and a 22% growth in average DAUs from December 2012 to December 2013.In 2013 compared to 2012, we increased the number of ads shown by 20% and the average price per ad by 36%. The increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by the increased number of News Feed ads on both mobile devices and personal computers, offset partially by product changes including our decision to lower the market reserve price, i.e. the minimum price threshold accepted in our auction. The increase in the number of ads shown was driven by user growth and the reserve price change, partially offset by a shift towards more usage on mobile devices, where we show fewer ads than on personal computers.Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 76% compared to the same period in 2012. The increase in ad revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 was driven by the same factors that drove 2013 annual ad revenue growth, primarily an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. For the fourth quarter of 2013, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 53% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 23% in the same period in 2012. Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 30%, 22%, and 18% between the third and fourth quarters of 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 declined 6% and 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Payments and other fees revenue in 2013 increased $76 million, or 9%, compared to 2012. The increase in Payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased Payments revenue from games played on Facebook on personal computers, and to a lesser extent, the inclusion of other fees revenue in 2013 from user Promoted Posts and our ad serving and measurement products.Payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 was $241 million, as compared to $256 million in the same period of 2012, which was affected by a one-time increase in Payments revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our Payments terms and conditions provide for a 30-day claim period subsequent to a Payments transaction during which the customer may dispute the virtual or digital goods transaction. Due to lack of historical transactional information, through the third quarter of 2012, we deferred recognition of Payments revenue until the expiration of the claim period as we were unable to make reasonable and reliable estimates 46of future refunds or chargebacks arising during this period. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had 24 months of historical transactional information which enabled us to estimate future refunds and chargebacks. Accordingly, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded all Payments revenues at the time of the purchase of the related virtual or digital goods, net of estimated refunds or chargebacks. This change resulted in a one-time increase in Payments revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $66 million as we recognized revenue from four months of transactions.In 2013, we generated approximately 46% of our revenue from marketers and developers based in the United States, compared to 51% in 2012. The change is due to a faster growth rate of international users and to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods. The majority of our revenue outside of the United States came from customers located in Western Europe, Canada, Australia and Brazil.2012 Compared to 2011. Revenue in 2012 increased $1.38 billion, or 37% compared to 2011. The increase was due primarily to a 36% increase in advertising revenue during 2012 as compared to 2011. Advertising revenue grew due to a 32% increase in the number of ads delivered during 2012 and to a 3% increase in the average price per ad. The increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth. Average DAUs grew 28% from December 2011 to December 2012 and MAUs grew 25% from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. Various product changes and changes in user engagement generally offset in their impact on the average number of ads per user. For example, the shift to greater mobile use generally reduced ads per user, while the introduction of ads in News Feed increased the number of ads per user. The rate of change in number of ads delivered also differs by geography, driven by factors such as mobile penetration. For example, Europe and Rest of World increased at a faster rate than the United States and Asia. Growth in the average price per ad during 2012 compared to 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in price per ad in the United States, which benefited from growth in ads in News Feed across desktop and mobile devices. Ads in News Feed have a significantly higher average price per ad due to factors which include the prominent position of the ads. The increase in price per ad in the United States was partially offset by an increased percentage of our worldwide ads being delivered in the Asia and Rest of World geographies where the average price per ad, while growing on a year-over-year basis, is relatively lower. The average price per ad was also affected by a decline in the average price per ad in Europe in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, an increase in the percentage of ads being delivered in European regions where the average price per ads is relatively lower, and in part, we believe, to continuing weak economic conditions in that region affecting advertiser demand.In 2012, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue as a percentage of advertising revenue was approximately 11%. As mobile advertising was not offered prior to the first quarter of 2012, comparisons to prior year are not meaningful.Payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased $253 million, or 45%, compared to 2011. Excluding the one-time increase in Payments revenue described above, Payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased 34% compared to 2011. Facebook Payments became mandatory for all game developers accepting payments on the Facebook website with limited exceptions on July 1, 2011. Accordingly, comparisons of Payments and other fees revenue to periods before this date may not be meaningful.In 2012, we generated approximately 51% of our revenue from marketers and developers based in the United States, compared to 56% in 2011. The change is due primarily to a faster growth rate of international users and, to a lesser extent, to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods. The majority of our revenue outside of the United States came from customers located in western Europe, Canada, Australia and Brazil.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and one customer represented 12% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. Cost of revenue Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012% Change 2012 vs 2011% Change (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue$1,875 $1,364 $860 37% 59%Percentage of revenue24% 27% 23% 2013 Compared to 2012. Cost of revenue in 2013 increased $511 million, or 37%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to expanding our data center and technical infrastructure, including a $275 million increase in depreciation in 2013. In addition, we recognized $117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013 primarily due to exiting certain 47leased data centers resulting from the migration of operations to our own data centers. In the event that circumstances change such that we decide to re-occupy and utilize any of the data centers we have exited, we would reverse the remaining lease abandonment liability associated with those facilities. The increase in cost of revenue in 2013 was partially offset by a $46 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to 2012 mainly due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012.2012 Compared to 2011. Cost of revenue in 2012 increased $504 million, or 59%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to expenses related to expanding our data center operations, including a $257 million increase in depreciation in 2012. Share-based compensation expense increased by $79 million in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Increases in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 65% increase in employee headcount also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue in 2012. These expenses supported our user growth, the increased usage of products by users, developers, and marketers, and the launch of new products.We anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase in dollar amount in 2014 and for the foreseeable future as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and offerings. The expected increase in cost of revenue may be partially mitigated to the extent we are able to realize improvements in server and network performance and the efficiency of our technical operations.

Research and development expenses in 2013 increased $16 million, or 1%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 50% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 in engineering and other technical functions. This increase in 2013 was offset by a $239 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to 2012 mainly due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012.2012 Compared to 2011. Research and development expenses in 2012 increased $1.01 billion, or 261%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $729 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 73% growth in employee headcount in engineering, design, product management, and other technical functions. This investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users, developers, and marketers.In 2014, we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees. We expect research and development expenses will rise in 2014 at a higher rate than it rose in 2013 due to the large share-based compensation expense in 2012 associated with Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO which lowered the growth rate between 2012 and 2013.Marketing and sales Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012% Change 2012 vs 2011% Change (dollars in millions) Marketing and sales$997 $896 $393 11% 128%Percentage of revenue13% 18% 11% 2013 Compared to 2012. Marketing and sales expenses in 2013 increased $101 million, or 11%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 36% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 to support global sales, business development and customer service. Our user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2013. These increases in 2013 were partially offset by a decrease 48in share-based compensation expense of $173 million compared to 2012 primarily due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012.2012 Compared to 2011. Marketing and sales expenses in 2012 increased $503 million, or 128%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $269 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expenses also increased due to a 19% increase in employee headcount to support global sales, business development and customer service. An increase in our user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2012.In 2014, we plan to add sales and business development employees, and increase our investment in user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing. We expect marketing and sales expenses will rise in 2014 at a higher rate than it rose in 2013 due to the large share-based compensation expense in 2012 associated with Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO which lowered the growth rate between 2012 and 2013.General and administrative Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012% Change 2012 vs 2011% Change (dollars in millions) General and administrative$781 $892 $314 (12)% 184%Percentage of revenue10% 18% 8% 2013 Compared to 2012. General and administrative expenses in 2013 decreased $111 million, or 12%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $208 million decrease in share-based compensation expense in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from recognition of expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012. The decrease in 2013 was partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 19% increase in employee headcount and increased amortization of acquired patents. 2012 Compared to 2011. General and administrative expenses in 2012 increased $578 million, or 184%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $278 million resulting from recognition of expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. The increase was also due to growth in legal fees and settlement costs, amortization of acquired patents and other professional service fees. Payroll and benefits expenses also increased for 2012 due to a 38% increase in employee headcount in corporate communications and policy, human resources, legal, finance, and other functions.In 2014, we expect general and administrative expenses will grow relative to 2013 as we continue to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support our growth.Interest and other expense, net Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012% Change 2012 vs 2011% Change (in millions) Interest expense$(56) $(51) $(42) 10 % 21 %Other income (expense), net6 7 (19) (14)% 137 %Interest and other expense, net$(50) $(44) $(61) 14 % (28)% 2013 Compared to 2012. Interest and other expense, net in 2013 increased $6 million, or 14%, compared to 2012. Interest expense increased by $5 million primarily due to interest on the $1.5 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012 and fully repaid in August 2013. Other income, net in 2013 decreased $1 million compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange loss resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances, offset by an increase in interest income resulting from higher invested cash balances.2012 Compared to 2011. Interest and other expense, net in 2012 decreased $17 million, or 28%, compared to 2011. Interest expense increased by $9 million primarily due to an increased volume of property and equipment financed by capital leases for 2012 49and interest on the $1.5 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012. Changes in other income (expense), net were primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses in 2012 resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances and an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances.Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012% Change 2012 vs 2011% Change (dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes$1,254 $441 $695 184% (37)%Effective tax rate46% 89% 41% 2013 Compared to 2012. Our provision for income taxes in 2013 increased $813 million, or 184%, compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in pretax income. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a lower amount of non-deductible share-based compensation resulting from recognition of expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012. Our effective tax rate in 2013 was also lower due to the reinstatement in 2013 of the federal tax credit for research and development activities. We recognized the benefit from the reinstatement of the tax credit for 2012 and 2013 during the year ended December 31, 2013. 2012 Compared to 2011. Our provision for income taxes in 2012 decreased $254 million, or 37%, compared to 2011, primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and the losses arising outside the United States in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate in 2012 was also higher due to the expiration of the federal tax credit for research and development activities.50 Quarterly Results of Operations Data The following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2013.

This charge resulted in a one-time increase in Payment revenue of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.(2)In the second quarter of 2012, we recognized $986 million of share-based compensation expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs that vested in connection with our IPO.

Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds and U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.45 billion as of December 31, 2013, an increase of $1.82 billion from December 31, 2012, primarily due to $4.22 billion of cash generated from operations, $1.48 billion of net proceeds from our follow-on equity offering which was completed in December 2013, and $609 million in excess tax benefit from share-based award activity, offset by the repayment of our $1.5 billion term loan, $1.36 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $889 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards. In January 2014, we began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of RSUs in order to cover any required withholding taxes (""sell-to-cover""), rather than our previous approach of net share settlement. We expect this sell-to-cover approach will reduce our cash outflows. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.In August 2013, in connection with the termination of our existing credit facilities, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 Revolving Credit Facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at LIBOR plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. We paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. Any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on August 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2013, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. See Note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional detail.As of December 31, 2013, $634 million of the $11.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have provided for the additional taxes that would be due if we repatriated these funds for use in our operations in the United States. 53Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities during 2013 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $1.01 billion and share-based compensation expense of $906 million, and an increase in other liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. The cash flow from operating activities during 2013 compared to 2012 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.45 billion and uncertain tax position of $786 million. In addition, we received income tax refunds of $421 million in 2013.Cash flow from operating activities during 2012 primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense of $1.57 billion and depreciation and amortization of $649 million, partially offset by income tax refundable of $451 million. The cash flow from operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 increased modestly as the increases in adjustments for non-cash items as described above were offset by a reduction in net income of $947 million and an increase in income tax refundable.Cash flow from operating activities during 2011 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $323 million and share-based compensation expense of $217 million.Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2013 primarily resulted from $1.36 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers, as well as $882 million for the net purchase of marketable securities and $368 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets, such as patents. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to decreases in the purchase of marketable securities and the acquisition of businesses and other assets.Cash used in investing activities during 2012 primarily resulted from $4.87 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities, $1.24 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers, as well as $911 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets, such as patents. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increases in the purchase of marketable securities, the acquisition of businesses and other assets, and capital expenditures.Cash used in investing activities during 2011 primarily resulted from the use of approximately $2.4 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities. Our cash used in investing activities in 2011 also consisted of capital expenditures of $606 million related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers.We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2014 of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion. Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during 2013 was $667 million, which primarily resulted from $1.5 billion for repayment of debt and $889 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $1.48 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our follow-on equity offering in December 2013.Cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was $6.28 billion, which primarily resulted from $6.8 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our IPO, $1.5 billion draw down from our unsecured term loan facility and $1.03 billion of excess tax benefits from stock award activities, partially offset by $2.86 billion of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards. Cash provided by financing activities during 2011 was $1.2 billion, primarily resulted from $998 million in net proceeds related to the completion of an offering of our Class A common stock to certain non-U.S. investors. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2013. 54Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations under capital and operating leases for equipment and office and data center facilities. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2013. Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations$978 $142 $281 $243 $312Capital lease obligations561 255 148 31 127Other contractual commitments(1)258 116 40 16 86Total contractual obligations$1,797 $513 $469 $290 $525_____________________(1)Other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure for our data center operations and, to a lesser extent, construction commitments related to our data center sites. In addition, our other liabilities include $886 million related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2013. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table. Contingencies We are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. Such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. See Note 10 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncement Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02) which is effective prospectively for public companies for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. This new accounting standard improves the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) by requiring an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of AOCI on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income. For other amounts that are not required under GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures required under GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. We adopted this new guidance on January 1, 2013 and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.55Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. We recognized foreign currency losses of $14 million, $9 million, and $29 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, and U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $73 million and $55 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.Inflation RiskWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.56",2023-12-30 16:18:46.070276
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2015,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Overview We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our Payments infrastructure that enables people who use Facebook to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded revenue of $12.47 billion, income from operations of $4.99 billion, and net income of $2.94 billion. 32Trends in Our User Metrics The numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (DAUs), mobile DAUs, MAUs, mobile MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), and certain other metrics such as mobile-only DAUs and mobile-only MAUs, do not include Instagram or WhatsApp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. In addition, other user engagement metrics do not include Instagram or WhatsApp unless otherwise specifically stated. Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our Messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with Facebook, on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement.Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 33Worldwide DAUs increased 18% to 890 million on average during December 2014 from 757 million during December 2013. We experienced growth in DAUs across major markets including India, Brazil, and the United States. Overall growth in DAUs was driven by increased mobile usage of Facebook, and the number of DAUs accessing Facebook on personal computers decreased in December 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. We believe that use of Facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.•Mobile DAUs. We define a mobile DAU as a user who accessed Facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our Messenger app on a given day. Worldwide mobile DAUs increased 34% to 745 million on average during December 2014 from 556 million during December 2013. In all regions, an increasing number of our DAUs accessed Facebook through mobile devices on average during December 2014 as compared to the same period during 2013, with users in Brazil, India, and the United States representing key sources of mobile DAU growth on average during December 2014. On average during the month ended December 31, 2014, there were 589 million DAUs who accessed Facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website, increasing 49% from 395 million mobile-only DAUs during the same period in 2013. The remaining mobile DAUs accessed Facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers. We anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.34•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our Messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with Facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community. As of December 31, 2014, we had 1.39 billion MAUs, an increase of 13% from December 31, 2013. Users in India, Brazil, and Indonesia represented key sources of growth in 2014. Overall growth in MAUs was driven by increased mobile usage of Facebook, and the number of MAUs accessing Facebook on personal computers decreased in December 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. We believe that use of Facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.•Mobile MAUs. We define a mobile MAU as a user who accessed Facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our Messenger app during the period of measurement. 35Worldwide mobile MAUs increased 26% to 1.19 billion as of December 31, 2014 from 945 million as of December 31, 2013. In all regions, an increasing number of our MAUs accessed Facebook through mobile devices in 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, with users in India, Brazil, and the United States representing key sources of mobile MAU growth in 2014. There were 526 million mobile MAUs who accessed Facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website during the month ended December 31, 2014, increasing 78% from 296 million during the same period in 2013. The remaining 663 million mobile MAUs accessed Facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during December 2014. We anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future. 36Trends in Our Monetization by User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users. For example, ARPU for an average user in 2014 in United States & Canada was more than six times higher than for an average user in Asia-Pacific. Note: Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 37For 2014, worldwide ARPU was $9.45, an increase of 39% from 2013. Over this period, ARPU increased by approximately 53% in United States & Canada, 44% in Europe, 42% in Asia-Pacific, and 27% in Rest of World. User growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition for Payments and Other FeesWe enable Payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers. People can make payments on Facebook by using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. We receive a fee from developers when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the Facebook website. The price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer. We remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed. Our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction. We record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person. Under GAAP guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent, the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment. We consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts. Should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales, we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.38Share-based CompensationWe account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those share-based awards that we expect to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any. We will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates.We have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies. As these awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition share-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. We believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of December 31, 2014. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected. Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible AssetsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step will be performed; otherwise, no further step is required. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. Any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. As of December 31, 2014, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.39In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.40Components of Results of OperationsRevenueWe generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our Payments infrastructure that enables people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers.Advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook properties, including our mobile applications, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. We recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action.Payments and other fees. We enable Payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. People can transact and make payments on the Facebook website by using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. We receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our Payments infrastructure. We recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. We have mandated the use of our Payments infrastructure for game applications on Facebook, and fees related to Payments are generated almost exclusively from games. Our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices. Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. Cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. Marketing and sales. Our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include people-, marketer-, and developer-facing marketing and promotional expenditures as well as amortization of intangible assets.General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of intangible assets we have acquired.41Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in millions)Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue$12,466 $7,872 $5,089Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue2,153 1,875 1,364Research and development2,666 1,415 1,399Marketing and sales1,680 997 896General and administrative973 781 892Total costs and expenses7,472 5,068 4,551Income from operations4,994 2,804 538Interest and other income/(expense), net(84) (50) (44)Income before provision for income taxes4,910 2,754 494Provision for income taxes1,970 1,254 441Net income$2,940 $1,500 $53Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in millions)Cost of revenue$62 $42 $88Research and development1,328 604 843Marketing and sales249 133 306General and administrative198 127 335Total share-based compensation expense$1,837 $906 $1,572 The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue100 % 100 % 100 %Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue17 24 27Research and development21 18 27Marketing and sales13 13 18General and administrative8 10 18Total costs and expenses60 64 89Income from operations40 36 11Interest and other income/(expense), net(1) (1) (1)Income before provision for income taxes39 35 10Provision for income taxes16 16 9Net income24 % 19 % 1 %42Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012Cost of revenue—% 1% 2%Research and development11 8 17Marketing and sales2 2 6General and administrative2 2 7Total share-based compensation expense15% 12% 31% Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2014 vs 2013% Change 2013 vs 2012% Change 2014 2013 2012 (in millions) Advertising$11,492 $6,986 $4,279 65% 63%Payments and other fees974 886 810 10% 9%Total revenue$12,466 $7,872 $5,089 58% 55% 2014 Compared to 2013. Revenue in 2014 increased $4.59 billion, or 58% compared to 2013. The increase was due primarily to a 65% increase in advertising revenue during 2014 as compared to 2013. The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. News Feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. In 2014, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 65% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 45% in 2013. Other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2014 included (i) an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory, (ii) other product changes to increase the value and performance of our ads, and (iii) an increase in user growth and engagement.In 2014 compared to 2013, the average price per ad increased by 173% and the number of ads delivered decreased by 40%. The increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-News Feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. Average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed. The reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers. Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased 53% compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 was driven by the same factors that drove 2014 annual advertising revenue growth, primarily an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 69% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 53% in the same period in 2013. Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 22%, 30%, and 22% between the third and fourth quarters of 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 declined 3% and 6% compared to the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively. Payments and other fees revenue in 2014 increased $88 million, or 10%, compared to 2013. The increase in Payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices.Payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $257 million, as compared to $241 million in the same period of 2013. Payments and other fees revenue is currently based predominantly on Payments revenue from games played on 43personal computers. We expect Facebook usage on personal computers will continue to decline in the future, which we expect to result in a decline of our Payments revenue. 2013 Compared to 2012. Revenue in 2013 increased $2.78 billion, or 55% compared to 2012. The increase was due primarily to a 63% increase in advertising revenue during 2013 as compared to 2012. The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. News Feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. In 2013, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 45% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 11% in 2012. Other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2013 included an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory, and a 22% growth in average DAUs from December 2012 to December 2013.In 2013 compared to 2012, we increased the number of ads shown by 20% and the average price per ad by 36%. The increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by the increased number of News Feed ads on both mobile devices and personal computers, offset partially by product changes including our decision to lower the market reserve price, i.e. the minimum price threshold accepted in our auction. The increase in the number of ads shown was driven by user growth and the reserve price change, partially offset by a shift towards more usage on mobile devices, where we show fewer ads than on personal computers.Payments and other fees revenue in 2013 increased $76 million, or 9%, compared to 2012. The increase in Payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased Payments revenue from games played on Facebook on personal computers, and to a lesser extent, the inclusion of other fees revenue in 2013 from user Promoted Posts and our ad serving and measurement products.In 2013, we generated approximately 46% of our revenue from marketers and developers based in the United States, compared to 51% in 2012. The change is due to a faster growth rate of international users and to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods. The majority of our revenue outside of the United States came from customers located in Western Europe, Canada, Australia and Brazil.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.Cost of revenue Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs 2013% Change 2013 vs 2012% Change (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue$2,153 $1,875 $1,364 15% 37%Percentage of revenue17% 24% 27% 2014 Compared to 2013. Cost of revenue in 2014 increased $278 million, or 15%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to our data center and technical infrastructure and increased amortization of our intangible assets. These increases were partially offset by items related to data center lease abandonment: we reversed $34 million of lease abandonment expense in 2014 due to our decision to re-occupy and utilize a previously exited data center, compared to a recognition of $117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013.2013 Compared to 2012. Cost of revenue in 2013 increased $511 million, or 37%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to expanding our data center and technical infrastructure, including a $275 million increase in depreciation in 2013. In addition, we recognized $117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013 primarily due to exiting certain leased data centers resulting from the migration of operations to our own data centers. The increase in cost of revenue in 2013 was partially offset by a $46 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to 2012.In 2015, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase at a higher rate than it increased in 2014 as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services. Additionally, we also expect an increase in amortization of our intangible assets.44Research and development Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs 2013% Change 2013 vs 2012% Change (dollars in millions) Research and development$2,666 $1,415 $1,399 88% 1%Percentage of revenue21% 18% 27% 2014 Compared to 2013. Research and development expenses in 2014 increased $1.25 billion, or 88%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $724 million in share-based compensation expense compared to 2013, and an increase in other payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 48% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 in engineering and other technical functions. Share-based compensation expense also increased due to the acquisitions we completed in 2014.2013 Compared to 2012. Research and development expenses in 2013 increased $16 million, or 1%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 50% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 in engineering and other technical functions. This increase in 2013 was offset by a $239 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to 2012.In 2015, we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees to support our research and development initiatives.Marketing and sales Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs 2013% Change 2013 vs 2012% Change (dollars in millions) Marketing and sales$1,680 $997 $896 69% 11%Percentage of revenue13% 13% 18% 2014 Compared to 2013. Marketing and sales expenses in 2014 increased $683 million, or 69%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 44% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 to support global sales, business development and customer service. Our people-, marketer-, and developer-facing marketing expense also increased $150 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Additionally, share-based compensation expense also increased $116 million compared to 2013.2013 Compared to 2012. Marketing and sales expenses in 2013 increased $101 million, or 11%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 36% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 to support global sales, business development and customer service. Our people-, marketer-, and developer-facing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2013. These increases in 2013 were partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $173 million compared to 2012.In 2015, we plan to add sales and business development employees, and increase our investment in marketing to our people, marketers and developers.

General and administrative expenses in 2014 increased $192 million, or 25%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 55% increase in employee headcount. Share-based compensation expense also increased $71 million compared to 2013. Additionally, professional services expense in 2014 also increased $58 million primarily due to higher consulting and other professional service fees.2013 Compared to 2012. General and administrative expenses in 2013 decreased $111 million, or 12%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $208 million decrease in share-based compensation expense in 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease in 2013 was partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 19% increase in employee headcount and increased amortization of acquired patents. In 2015, we plan to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support overall company growth.Interest and other income/(expense), net Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs 2013% Change 2013 vs 2012% Change (in millions) Interest income/(expense), net$4 $(37) $(37) 111 % — %Other income/(expense), net(88) (13) (7) (577)% (86)%Interest and other income/(expense), net$(84) $(50) $(44) (68)% (14)% 2014 Compared to 2013. Interest and other income/(expense), net in 2014 decreased $34 million, or 68%, compared to 2013. Other income/(expense), net decreased primarily due to $87 million in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. The decrease in other income/(expense), net was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of our long-term debt in August 2013 and lower capital lease payments.2013 Compared to 2012. Interest and other income/(expense), net in 2013 decreased $6 million, or 14%, compared to 2012. Other income/(expense), net decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. In addition, interest expense increased by $5 million primarily due to interest on the $1.5 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012 and fully repaid in August 2013, offset by an increase in interest income resulting from higher invested cash balances.Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs 2013% Change 2013 vs 2012% Change (dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes$1,970 $1,254 $441 57% 184%Effective tax rate40% 46% 89% 2014 Compared to 2013. Our provision for income taxes in 2014 increased $716 million, or 57%, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to non-deductible share-based compensation, operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S., and tax research credits. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a change in our geographic mix of pre-tax income.2013 Compared to 2012. Our provision for income taxes in 2013 increased $813 million, or 184%, compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a lower amount of non-deductible share-based compensation. Our effective tax rate in 2013 was also lower due to the reinstatement in 2013 of the federal tax credit for research and development activities. We recognized the benefit from the reinstatement of the tax credit for 2012 and 2013 during the year ended December 31, 2013. 46 Quarterly Results of Operations DataThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2014.

Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.20 billion as of December 31, 2014, a decrease of $250 million from December 31, 2013, primarily due to $4.98 billion for acquisitions of businesses and $2.50 billion for other cash outflows mainly related to purchases of property and equipment. These decreases were partially offset by $5.46 billion of cash generated from operations and $1.87 billion in excess tax benefit from share-based award activity. In October 2014, the tax withholdings related to the WhatsApp vested merger consideration were funded by net share settlement. The amount remitted to the tax authorities for the employees' tax obligation to the tax authorities was reflected as a financing activity within our consolidated statements of cash flows.In January 2014, we began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of RSUs in order to cover any required withholding taxes (""sell-to-cover""), rather than our previous approach of net share settlement. This sell-to-cover approach reduces our cash outflows compared to the net share settlement approach.In August 2013, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 Revolving Credit Facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at LIBOR plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. We paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. Any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on August 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2014, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. As of December 31, 2014, $1.57 billion of the $11.20 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Substantially all of these funds are in jurisdictions for which we are indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of the local subsidiary. These subsidiaries have historically incurred losses; as such, repatriating the funds will likely incur no residual tax liability. We have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary, however the amount of taxes provided has been insignificant. 49 We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities during 2014 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including share-based compensation expense of $1.79 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.24 billion. The cash flow from operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.44 billion, as adjusted for certain non-cash items described above, partially offset by a decrease in income tax refunds of $415 million.Cash flow from operating activities during 2013 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $1.01 billion and share-based compensation expense of $906 million, and an increase in other liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. The cash flow from operating activities during 2013 compared to 2012 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.45 billion and uncertain tax position of $786 million. In addition, we received income tax refunds of $421 million in 2013.Cash flow from operating activities during 2012 primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense of $1.57 billion and depreciation and amortization of $649 million, partially offset by income tax refundable of $451 million. The cash flow from operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 increased modestly as the increases in adjustments for non-cash items as described above were offset by a reduction in net income of $947 million and an increase in income tax refundable.Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily resulted from $4.98 billion for the acquisition of businesses and $1.83 billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings, partially offset by $1.24 billion for the net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly due to increases in acquisitions of businesses and capital expenditures, partially offset by net sales of marketable securities.Cash used in investing activities during 2013 primarily resulted from $1.36 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers, as well as $882 million for the net purchase of marketable securities and $368 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets, such as patents. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to decreases in the purchase of marketable securities and the acquisition of businesses and other assets.Cash used in investing activities during 2012 primarily resulted from $4.87 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities, $1.24 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers, as well as $911 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets, such as patents. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increases in the purchase of marketable securities, the acquisition of businesses and other assets, and capital expenditures.We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2015 of approximately $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion. Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was $1.57 billion, which primarily resulted from $1.87 billion of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity, partially offset by $243 million of payments related to our capital lease transactions, and $73 million of tax payments related to net share settlement resulting mainly from the vested merger consideration of an acquisition.Cash used in financing activities during 2013 was $667 million, which primarily resulted from $1.50 billion for repayment of debt and $889 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement, partially offset by $1.48 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our follow-on equity offering in December 2013.Cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was $6.28 billion, which primarily resulted from $6.76 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our initial public offering, $1.50 billion draw down from our unsecured term loan facility and $1.03 billion of excess tax benefits from share-based award activity, partially offset by $2.86 billion of taxes paid related to the net share settlement. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2014. 50Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under operating and capital leases for equipment, office, and data center facilities. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2014. Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations$1,101 $155 $319 $268 $359Capital lease obligations303 124 35 32 112Other contractual commitments(1)1,031 644 84 64 239Total contractual obligations$2,435 $923 $438 $364 $710_____________________(1)Other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure for our data center operations and, to a lesser extent, construction commitments related to our data center sites. In addition, our other liabilities include $1.19 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2014. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table. Contingencies We are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. Such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. See Note 10 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance related to revenue from contracts with customers. Under this guidance, revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Early adoption is not permitted. The updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.51Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. We recognized foreign currency losses of $87 million, $14 million, and $9 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $63 million and $73 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.52",2023-12-30 16:18:46.100378
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2016,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Certain revenue information in the sections entitled ""Executive Overview of Full Year 2015 Results"" and ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue"" is presented on a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year 2015 using 2014 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2015 ResultsOur key user metrics and financial results for 2015 are as follows:User growth:•Daily active users (DAUs) were 1.04 billion on average for December 2015, an increase of 17% year-over-year.•Mobile DAUs were 934 million on average for December 2015, an increase of 25% year-over-year.•Monthly active users (MAUs) were 1.59 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of 14% year-over-year.•Mobile MAUs were 1.44 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of 21% year-over-year.Financial results:•Revenue was $17.93 billion, up 44% year-over-year (or 53% year-over-year on a constant currency basis), and ad revenue was $17.08 billion, up 49% year-over-year (or 59% year-over-year on a constant currency basis).•Total costs and expenses were $11.70 billion.•Income from operations was $6.23 billion.•Net income was $3.69 billion with diluted earnings per share of $1.29.•Capital expenditures were $2.52 billion.•Effective tax rate was 40%.•Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $18.43 billion as of December 31, 2015.•Headcount was 12,691 as of December 31, 2015.In 2015, we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile, (ii) growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers.In addition, we invested, and will continue to invest, across three priorities: (i) our core products and services to better serve our existing communities and businesses, (ii) our next generation of services, such as Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, and (iii) our long-term innovation efforts, such as connectivity efforts, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence research. We expect these investments will continue to drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2015.32Trends in Our User MetricsThe numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (DAUs), mobile DAUs, MAUs, mobile MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), and certain other metrics such as mobile-only DAUs and mobile-only MAUs, do not include Instagram or WhatsApp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. In addition, other user engagement metrics do not include Instagram or WhatsApp unless otherwise specifically stated.Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.•Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement.Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 33Worldwide DAUs increased 17% to 1.04 billion on average during December 2015 from 890 million during December 2014. We experienced growth in DAUs across major markets, including India, the United States, and Brazil. Overall growth in DAUs was driven by increased mobile usage of Facebook, and the number of DAUs accessing Facebook on personal computers decreased in December 2015, compared to the same period in 2014. We believe that use of Facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.•Mobile DAUs. We define a mobile DAU as a user who accessed Facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user) on a given day. We define a mobile-only DAU as a user who accessed Facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website on a given day, whereas a mobile DAU may have also accessed Facebook on a personal computer on that day.Worldwide mobile DAUs increased 25% to 934 million on average during December 2015 from 745 million during December 2014. In all regions, an increasing number of our DAUs accessed Facebook through mobile devices on average during December 2015, as compared to the same period during 2014, with users in India, Brazil, and the United States representing key sources of mobile DAU growth on average during December 2015. On average during December 2015, there were 789 million mobile-only DAUs, increasing 34% from 589 million mobile-only DAUs during the same period in 2014. The remaining mobile DAUs accessed Facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers. We anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.34•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community. As of December 31, 2015, we had 1.59 billion MAUs, an increase of 14% from December 31, 2014. Users in India, the United States, and Brazil represented key sources of growth in 2015. Overall growth in MAUs was driven by increased mobile usage of Facebook, and the number of MAUs accessing Facebook on personal computers decreased in December 2015, compared to the same period in 2014. We believe that use of Facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.•Mobile MAUs. We define a mobile MAU as a user who accessed Facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user) during the period of measurement. We define a mobile-only MAU as a user who accessed Facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website during the period of measurement, whereas a mobile MAU may have also accessed Facebook on a personal computer during the period of measurement.35Worldwide mobile MAUs increased 21% to 1.44 billion as of December 31, 2015 from 1.19 billion as of December 31, 2014. In all regions, an increasing number of our MAUs accessed Facebook through mobile devices in 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, with users in India, Brazil, and the United States representing key sources of mobile MAU growth in 2015. There were 823 million mobile-only MAUs as of December 31, 2015, increasing 56% from 526 million mobile-only MAUs during the same period in 2014. The remaining 619 million mobile MAUs accessed Facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during December 2015. We anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future. 36Trends in Our Monetization by User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2015 in the United States & Canada region was more than seven times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region. Note: Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 37For 2015, worldwide ARPU was $11.96, an increase of 27% from 2014. Over this period, ARPU increased by 45% in United States & Canada, 23% in Europe, 22% in Asia-Pacific, and 15% in Rest of World. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from 2014 to 2015 had an unfavorable impact on the growth rate of our ARPU outside the United States and Canada region. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue Recognition for Payments and Other FeesWe enable Payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers. People can make payments on Facebook by using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. We receive a fee from developers when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the Facebook website. The price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer. We remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed. Our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction. We record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person. Under GAAP guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent, the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment. We consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts. Should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales, we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.38Share-based CompensationWe account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those share-based awards that we expect to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any. We will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates.We have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies. As these awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition share-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.We believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of December 31, 2015. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible AssetsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. We evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. As of December 31, 2015, no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets has been identified.Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.39Components of Results of OperationsRevenueAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook properties, including our mobile applications, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. We recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Payments and other fees. We enable Payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. People can transact and make payments on the Facebook website by using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. We receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our Payments infrastructure. We recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. We have mandated the use of our Payments infrastructure for game applications on Facebook, and fees related to Payments are generated almost exclusively from games. Our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, energy and bandwidth costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. Cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.Marketing and sales. Our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include professional and legal services. General and administrative expenses also include depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets we have acquired.40Results of OperationsThe following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data: Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions)Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue$17,928 $12,466 $7,872Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue2,867 2,153 1,875Research and development4,816 2,666 1,415Marketing and sales2,725 1,680 997General and administrative1,295 973 781Total costs and expenses11,703 7,472 5,068Income from operations6,225 4,994 2,804Interest and other income/(expense), net(31) (84) (50)Income before provision for income taxes6,194 4,910 2,754Provision for income taxes2,506 1,970 1,254Net income$3,688 $2,940 $1,500Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions)Cost of revenue$81 $62 $42Research and development2,350 1,328 604Marketing and sales320 249 133General and administrative218 198 127Total share-based compensation expense$2,969 $1,837 $906 The following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue100% 100 % 100 %Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue16 17 24Research and development27 21 18Marketing and sales15 13 13General and administrative7 8 10Total costs and expenses65 60 64Income from operations35 40 36Interest and other income/(expense), net— (1) (1)Income before provision for income taxes35 39 35Provision for income taxes14 16 16Net income21% 24 % 19 %41Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Cost of revenue—% —% 1%Research and development13 11 8Marketing and sales2 2 2General and administrative1 2 2Total share-based compensation expense17% 15% 12% Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2015 vs 2014% Change 2014 vs 2013% Change 2015 2014 2013 (in millions) Advertising$17,079 $11,492 $6,986 49 % 65%Payments and other fees849 974 886 (13)% 10%Total revenue$17,928 $12,466 $7,872 44 % 58% 2015 Compared to 2014. Revenue in 2015 increased $5.46 billion, or 44% compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue.The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on mobile devices. In 2015, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 77% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 65% in 2014. Factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth in 2015 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, (ii) an increase in mobile user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in News Feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads.In 2015 compared to 2014, the average price per ad increased by 140% and the number of ads delivered decreased by 38%. The increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-News Feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. Average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed. The reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 57% compared to the same period in 2014. The increase in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors that drove 2015 annual advertising revenue growth, primarily an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on mobile devices. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 80% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 69% in the same period in 2014.Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 31%, 22%, and 30% between the third and fourth quarters of 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014 declined 8% and 3% compared to the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively.Payments and other fees revenue in 2015 decreased $125 million, or 13%, compared to 2014. The decrease in Payments and other fees revenue was a result of decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers, partially offset by an increase in other fees revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.Payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 decreased $53 million, or 21%, compared to the same period in 2014. 42Payments and other fees revenue is currently based predominantly on Payments revenue from games played on personal computers. As users shift their usage to mobile devices, Facebook usage on personal computers has been declining and will continue to decline in the future, resulting in a decline in our Payments revenue. 2014 Compared to 2013. Revenue in 2014 increased $4.59 billion, or 58% compared to 2013. The increase was due primarily to a 65% increase in advertising revenue during 2014 as compared to 2013.The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. News Feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. In 2014, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 65% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 45% in 2013. Other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2014 included (i) an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory, (ii) other product changes to increase the value and performance of our ads, and (iii) an increase in user growth and engagement.In 2014 compared to 2013, the average price per ad increased by 173% and the number of ads delivered decreased by 40%. The increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-News Feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. Average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed. The reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.Payments and other fees revenue in 2014 increased $88 million, or 10%, compared to 2013. The increase in Payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.Foreign Exchange Impact on RevenueThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from the fourth quarter of and full year 2014 to the same periods in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year 2015 using 2014 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue would have been $6.16 billion and $19.11 billion, respectively, and our advertising revenue would have been $5.96 billion and $18.26 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, both revenue and advertising revenue would have been $322 million and $1.19 billion higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year 2015, respectively.There were no material foreign exchange impacts on our revenue and advertising revenue from the full year 2013 to the same period in 2014.Cost of revenue Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014% Change 2014 vs 2013% Change (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue$2,867 $2,153 $1,875 33% 15%Percentage of revenue16% 17% 24% 2015 Compared to 2014. Cost of revenue in 2015 increased $714 million, or 33%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure of $480 million, compared to 2014. Amortization of our intangible assets in 2015 also increased $100 million compared to 2014, mostly due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014.2014 Compared to 2013. Cost of revenue in 2014 increased $278 million, or 15%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to our data center and technical infrastructure and increased amortization of our intangible assets. These increases were partially offset by items related to data center lease abandonment: we reversed $34 million of lease abandonment expense in 2014 due to our decision to re-occupy and utilize a previously exited data center, compared to a recognition of $117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013.43In 2016, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services.Research and development Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014% Change 2014 vs 2013% Change (dollars in millions) Research and development$4,816 $2,666 $1,415 81% 88%Percentage of revenue27% 21% 18% 2015 Compared to 2014. Research and development expenses in 2015 increased $2.15 billion, or 81%, compared to 2014. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $1.02 billion compared to 2014, which reflected the full year impact of share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014. In addition, other payroll and benefits expense increased as a result of a 43% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 in engineering and other technical functions.2014 Compared to 2013. Research and development expenses in 2014 increased $1.25 billion, or 88%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $724 million in share-based compensation expense compared to 2013, and an increase in other payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 48% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 in engineering and other technical functions. Share-based compensation expense also increased due to the acquisitions we completed in 2014.In 2016, we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees and increasing our investment to support our research and development initiatives.Marketing and sales Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014% Change 2014 vs 2013% Change (dollars in millions) Marketing and sales$2,725 $1,680 $997 62% 69%Percentage of revenue15% 13% 13% 2015 Compared to 2014. Marketing and sales expenses in 2015 increased $1.05 billion, or 62%, compared to 2014. The majority of the increase was due to increases in amortization of our intangible assets of $305 million due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014, and in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 32% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 in our marketing and sales functions. Additionally, our marketing expenses increased $258 million in 2015, compared to 2014.2014 Compared to 2013. Marketing and sales expenses in 2014 increased $683 million, or 69%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 44% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 in our marketing and sales functions. Our marketing expenses also increased $150 million in 2014, compared to 2013. Additionally, share-based compensation expense also increased $116 million compared to 2013.In 2016, we plan to continue to increase our investment and hire marketing and sales employees to support our marketing efforts.General and administrative Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014% Change 2014 vs 2013% Change (dollars in millions) General and administrative$1,295 $973 $781 33% 25%Percentage of revenue7% 8% 10% 442015 Compared to 2014. General and administrative expenses in 2015 increased $322 million, or 33%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 36% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 in general and administrative functions, including an increase of $20 million in share-based compensation expense in 2015, and to a lesser extent, higher legal and other professional services fees.2014 Compared to 2013. General and administrative expenses in 2014 increased $192 million, or 25%, compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 55% increase in employee headcount in general and administrative functions. Share-based compensation expense also increased $71 million compared to 2013. Additionally, professional services expense in 2014 also increased $58 million primarily due to higher consulting and other professional service fees.In 2016, we plan to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support overall company growth.Interest and other income/(expense), net Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014% Change 2014 vs 2013% Change (in millions) Interest income/(expense), net$29 $4 $(37) 625% 111 %Other income/(expense), net(60) (88) (13) 32% (577)%Interest and other income/(expense), net$(31) $(84) $(50) 63% (68)% 2015 Compared to 2014. Interest and other income/(expense), net in 2015 increased $53 million, or 63%, compared to 2014. Other income/(expense), net increased primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. In addition, interest income/(expense), net increased due to higher invested cash balances and interest rates.2014 Compared to 2013. Interest and other income/(expense), net in 2014 decreased $34 million, or 68%, compared to 2013. Other income/(expense), net decreased primarily due to $87 million in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. The decrease in other income/(expense), net was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of our long-term debt in August 2013 and lower capital lease payments.Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 2015 vs 2014% Change 2014 vs 2013% Change (dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes$2,506 $1,970 $1,254 27% 57%Effective tax rate40% 40% 46% 2015 Compared to 2014. Our provision for income taxes in 2015 increased $536 million, or 27%, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate in 2015 remained flat, compared to 2014.Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily because of the impact of acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business, non-deductible share-based compensation, operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S., and tax research credits. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the United States, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions. Our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing, size, and integration of any acquisitions we make.On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of share-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. This opinion concluded that related parties in a cost-sharing arrangement are not required to share share-based compensation. A final decision was issued by the Tax Court, however, this decision may be appealed by the Commissioner. The impact of the conclusions stated by the Tax Court in its opinion was not material to our consolidated financial statements.452014 Compared to 2013. Our provision for income taxes in 2014 increased $716 million, or 57%, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to non-deductible share-based compensation, operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S., and tax research credits. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a change in our geographic mix of pre-tax income.46Quarterly Results of Operations DataThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2015. We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data.

Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $18.43 billion as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $7.24 billion from December 31, 2014, primarily due to $8.60 billion of cash generated from operations and $1.72 billion in excess tax benefits from share-based award activity, partially offset by $2.52 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $313 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets.Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $270 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $2.70 billion, although we anticipate only a relatively small portion of this will be available to offset our federal taxable income in 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.08 billion of federal tax credits, substantially all of which will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2016. We expect that the amount of cash paid for income taxes to significantly increase in 2016.In August 2013, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 Revolving Credit Facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at LIBOR plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. We paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. Any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on August 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.As of December 31, 2015, $1.90 billion of the $18.43 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Substantially all of these funds are in jurisdictions for which we are indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of the local subsidiary. We have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary, however the amount of taxes provided has been insignificant.We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.49Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash flow from operating activities during 2015, mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $2.96 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.95 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for share-based compensation expense, and higher income tax payable as of December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. Cash flow from operating activities during 2014, primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $1.79 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.24 billion. The cash flow from operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.44 billion, as adjusted for certain non-cash items described above, partially offset by a decrease in income tax refunds of $415 million.Cash flow from operating activities during 2013, primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $1.01 billion and share-based compensation expense of $906 million, and an increase in other liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. The cash flow from operating activities during 2013 compared to 2012 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.45 billion and uncertain tax position of $786 million. In addition, we received income tax refunds of $421 million in 2013.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $9.43 billion during 2015, primarily due to $6.70 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $2.52 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office buildings. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets.Cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily resulted from $4.98 billion for the acquisition of businesses and $1.83 billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings, partially offset by $1.24 billion for the net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly due to increases in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets, and capital expenditures, partially offset by net sales of marketable securities.Cash used in investing activities during 2013 primarily resulted from $1.36 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers, as well as $882 million for the net purchase of marketable securities and $368 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets, such as patents. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to decreases in the purchase of marketable securities and the acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets.We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2016 of approximately $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion.Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing ActivitiesCash flow from financing activities during 2015, mostly consisted of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity and principal payments on capital lease obligations. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was mostly due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions and lower tax payments related to the net share settlement, partially offset by a decrease of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity.Cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was $1.57 billion, which primarily resulted from $1.87 billion of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity, partially offset by $243 million of payments related to our capital lease transactions, and $73 million of tax payments related to net share settlement resulting mainly from the vested merger consideration of an acquisition.Cash used in financing activities during 2013 was $667 million, which primarily resulted from $1.50 billion for repayment of debt and $889 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement, partially offset by $1.48 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our follow-on equity offering in December 2013.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.50Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under operating and capital leases for equipment, office, and data center facilities. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2015 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations$1,452 $209 $446 $359 $438Capital lease obligations174 16 31 33 94Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility(1)337 — — 38 299Other contractual commitments(2)1,222 752 86 73 311Total contractual obligations$3,185 $977 $563 $503 $1,142(1)Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility represents our commitment to lease an entire office building in London, United Kingdom, that is currently under construction. As of December 31, 2015, $62 million of the total obligation was recorded as a liability and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this financing obligation.(2)Other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure for our data center operations and, to a lesser extent, construction commitments related to our data center sites. In addition, our other liabilities include $2.46 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.ContingenciesWe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other legal proceedings. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. Such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 10 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting PronouncementIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. As such, the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. We are still evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The updated standard is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2017 with early application permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period. We early adopted this standard retrospectively, and reclassified our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets for all periods presented. As a result of the reclassifications, certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets.51Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have negatively affected our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. We recognized foreign currency losses of $66 million, $87 million, and $14 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $173 million and $63 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.52",2023-12-30 16:18:45.964176
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2017,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Certain revenue information in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue"" is presented on a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2016 using 2015 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2016 Results Our key user metrics and financial results for 2016 are as follows:User growth:•Daily active users (DAUs) were 1.23 billion on average for December 2016, an increase of 18% year-over-year.•Monthly active users (MAUs) were 1.86 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of 17% year-over-year.Financial results:•Revenue was $27.64 billion, up 54% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $26.89 billion, up 57% year-over-year.•Total costs and expenses were $15.21 billion*.•Income from operations was $12.43 billion*.•Net income was $10.22 billion* with diluted earnings per share of $3.49*.•Capital expenditures were $4.49 billion.•Effective tax rate was 18%*.•Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $29.45 billion as of December 31, 2016.•Headcount was 17,048 as of December 31, 2016.*In the fourth quarter of 2016, we elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvement to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09) which required us to reflect any adoption adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. As such, certain full year 2016 financial results data above included the impacts of the ASU 2016-09 adoption. See Note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this adoption.In 2016, we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile, (ii) growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers.We continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform as well as video, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives that we believe will further our mission to connect the world, such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence. We intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we expect these investments and our increasingly global scale will drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2016. In addition, we anticipate our expenses in 2017 will continue to grow as we execute on priorities such as (i) hiring top engineering talent, (ii) investing in research and development, content, and sales and marketing efforts, and (iii) expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our rapid growth.33Trends in Our User MetricsThe numbers for our key metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. In addition, other user engagement metrics do not include Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus unless otherwise specifically stated.Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement.Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 34Worldwide DAUs increased 18% to 1.23 billion on average during December 2016 from 1.04 billion during December 2015. We experienced growth in DAUs across major markets, including India, Indonesia, and Brazil.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community.As of December 31, 2016, we had 1.86 billion MAUs, an increase of 17% from December 31, 2015. Users in India, Indonesia, and Brazil represented key sources of growth in 2016, relative to the same period in 2015.35Trends in Our Monetization by User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2016 in the United States & Canada region was more than eight times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.Note: Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. We discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography in late 2015. While this issue did not affect our overall worldwide revenue, it did affect our attribution of revenue to different geographic regions. The fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and ARPU amounts for all regions were adjusted to reflect this reclassification.36For 2016, worldwide ARPU was $15.98, an increase of 34% from 2015. Over this period, ARPU increased by 49% in United States & Canada, 35% in Europe, 34% in Asia-Pacific, and 25% in Rest of World. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.Share-based CompensationWe account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award. We elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the fourth quarter of 2016, which among other items, provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than to account for them based on an estimate of expected forfeitures. We elected to account for forfeitures as they occur and therefore, share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 has been calculated based on actual forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income, rather than our previous approach which was net of estimated forfeitures. The net cumulative effect of this change was recognized as a $39 million increase to paid-in capital as of January 1, 2016. Share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were recorded net of estimated forfeitures, which were based on historical forfeitures and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any.37We have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies. As these awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition share-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.We believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of December 31, 2016. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible AssetsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2016, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.38Components of Results of OperationsRevenueAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. We recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Payments and other fees. We enable Payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. People can transact and make payments on the Facebook website by using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. We receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our Payments infrastructure. We recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. We have mandated the use of our Payments infrastructure for game applications on Facebook, and fees related to Payments are generated almost exclusively from games. Our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales, and our ad serving and measurement products.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.Marketing and sales. Our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.General and administrative. The majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include professional and legal services. 39Results of OperationsThe following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data, including certain income data for the year ended December 31, 2016 that reflects the impacts of the early adoption of ASU 2016-09: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue$27,638 $17,928 $12,466Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue3,789 2,867 2,153Research and development5,919 4,816 2,666Marketing and sales3,772 2,725 1,680General and administrative1,731 1,295 973Total costs and expenses15,211 11,703 7,472Income from operations12,427 6,225 4,994Interest and other income/(expense), net91 (31) (84)Income before provision for income taxes12,518 6,194 4,910Provision for income taxes2,301 2,506 1,970Net income$10,217 $3,688 $2,940Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in millions)Cost of revenue$113 $81 $62Research and development2,494 2,350 1,328Marketing and sales368 320 249General and administrative243 218 198Total share-based compensation expense$3,218 $2,969 $1,837 40The following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue100% 100% 100 %Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue14 16 17Research and development21 27 21Marketing and sales14 15 13General and administrative6 7 8Total costs and expenses55 65 60Income from operations45 35 40Interest and other income/(expense), net— — (1)Income before provision for income taxes45 35 39Provision for income taxes8 14 16Net income37% 21% 24 %Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014Cost of revenue—% —% —%Research and development9 13 11Marketing and sales1 2 2General and administrative1 1 2Total share-based compensation expense12% 17% 15% Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2016 vs 2015% Change 2015 vs 2014% Change 2016 2015 2014 (in millions) Advertising$26,885 $17,079 $11,492 57 % 49 %Payments and other fees753 849 974 (11)% (13)%Total revenue$27,638 $17,928 $12,466 54 % 44 % 2016 Compared to 2015. Revenue in 2016 increased $9.71 billion, or 54%, compared to 2015. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue.The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed. For 2016, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 83% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 77% in 2015. Factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2016 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, (ii) an increase in user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in News Feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. However, we anticipate increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed in News Feed will be a less significant driver of our revenue growth in the future.In 2016 compared to 2015, the average price per ad increased by 5% and the number of ads delivered increased by 50%. The increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising growth.41Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 27%, 31%, and 22% between the third and fourth quarters of 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2016 and 2015 declined 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014.Payments and other fees revenue in 2016 decreased $96 million, or 11%, compared to 2015. The majority of the decrease in Payments and other fees revenue was due to decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers. We anticipate Payments and other fees revenue will continue to decline in 2017.2015 Compared to 2014. Revenue in 2015 increased $5.46 billion, or 44%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue.The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on mobile devices. In 2015, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 77% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 65% in 2014. Factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth in 2015 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, (ii) an increase in mobile user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in News Feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads.In 2015 compared to 2014, the average price per ad increased by 140% and the number of ads delivered decreased by 38%. The increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-News Feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. Average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed. The reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.Payments and other fees revenue in 2015 decreased $125 million, or 13%, compared to 2014. The decrease in Payments and other fees revenue was a result of decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers, partially offset by an increase in other fees revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from the full year 2015 compared to the same period in 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2016 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $27.91 billion, and $27.15 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $270 million and $269 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2016.The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from the full year 2014 to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2015 using 2014 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $19.11 billion and $18.26 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, both revenue and advertising revenue would have been $1.19 billion higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2015.Cost of revenue Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015% Change 2015 vs 2014% Change (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue$3,789 $2,867 $2,153 32% 33%Percentage of revenue14% 16% 17% 2016 Compared to 2015. Cost of revenue in 2016 increased $922 million, or 32%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements. 422015 Compared to 2014. Cost of revenue in 2015 increased $714 million, or 33%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, compared to 2014. Amortization of our intangible assets in 2015 also increased $100 million compared to 2014, mostly due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014.In 2017, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements.Research and development Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015% Change 2015 vs 2014% Change (dollars in millions) Research and development$5,919 $4,816 $2,666 23% 81%Percentage of revenue21% 27% 21% 2016 Compared to 2015. Research and development expenses in 2016 increased $1.10 billion, or 23%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 34% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 in engineering and other technical functions. Additionally, our equipment and related expenses in 2016 to support our research and development efforts increased $170 million compared to 2015.2015 Compared to 2014. Research and development expenses in 2015 increased $2.15 billion, or 81%, compared to 2014. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $1.02 billion compared to 2014, which reflected the full year impact of share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014. In addition, other payroll and benefits expense increased as a result of a 43% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 in engineering and other technical functions.In 2017, we plan to continue to accelerate the hiring of software engineers and other technical employees and increasing our investment to support our research and development initiatives.Marketing and sales Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015% Change 2015 vs 2014% Change (dollars in millions) Marketing and sales$3,772 $2,725 $1,680 38% 62%Percentage of revenue14% 15% 13% 2016 Compared to 2015. Marketing and sales expenses in 2016 increased $1.05 billion, or 38%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 28% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 in our marketing and sales functions, and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees. Additionally, our marketing expenses increased $344 million in 2016, compared to 2015.2015 Compared to 2014. Marketing and sales expenses in 2015 increased $1.05 billion, or 62%, compared to 2014. The majority of the increase was due to increases in amortization of our intangible assets of $305 million due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014, and in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 32% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 in our marketing and sales functions. Additionally, our marketing expenses increased $258 million in 2015, compared to 2014.In 2017, we plan to continue to increase our investment and the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and partnership efforts.43General and administrative Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015% Change 2015 vs 2014% Change (dollars in millions) General and administrative$1,731 $1,295 $973 34% 33%Percentage of revenue6% 7% 8% 2016 Compared to 2015. General and administrative expenses in 2016 increased $436 million, or 34%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 43% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 in general and administrative functions, and to a lesser extent, higher professional services and legal fees.2015 Compared to 2014. General and administrative expenses in 2015 increased $322 million, or 33%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 36% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 in general and administrative functions, including an increase of $20 million in share-based compensation expense in 2015, and to a lesser extent, higher legal and other professional services fees.In 2017, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth.Interest and other income/(expense), net Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015% Change 2015 vs 2014% Change (in millions) Interest income/(expense), net$166 $29 $4 NM NMOther income/(expense), net(75) (60) (88) (25)% 32%Interest and other income/(expense), net$91 $(31) $(84) NM 63% 2016 Compared to 2015. Interest and other income/(expense), net in 2016 increased $122 million compared to 2015. Interest income/(expense), net increased mostly due to increases in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. In addition, the majority of the decrease in other income/(expense), net was due to foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances.2015 Compared to 2014. Interest and other income/(expense), net in 2015 increased $53 million, or 63%, compared to 2014. Other income/(expense), net increased primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances. In addition, interest income/(expense), net increased due to higher invested cash balances and interest rates.Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015% Change 2015 vs 2014% Change (dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes$2,301 $2,506 $1,970 (8)% 27%Effective tax rate18% 40% 40% 2016 Compared to 2015. Our provision for income taxes in 2016 decreased $205 million, or 8%, compared to 2015, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, and was partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate decreased due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate where we have asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest certain of those earnings, as well as due to a lower increase in our unrecognized tax benefit in 2016 compared to 2015 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2016.44The adoption of ASU 2016-09 significantly impacts both the timing and method of how the tax effects of share-based awards are recognized. ASU 2016-09 requires the income tax effects to be recognized in the provision for income taxes when the awards vest or are settled whereas previously such income tax benefits were recognized as part of additional paid-in capital and could not be recognized until they were realized through a reduction in income taxes payable. These combined effects had the impact of decreasing our provision for income taxes by $934 million and our effective tax rate by 7% in 2016. Excluding the adoption of ASU 2016-09, our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in 2016 would have been $3.24 billion and 26%, respectively.In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the IRS prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of approximately $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the United States Tax Court challenging the Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of $3.0 to $5.0 billion in excess of the originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and penalties. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position, the assessed tax, interest and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 2015 Compared to 2014. Our provision for income taxes in 2015 increased $536 million, or 27%, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate in 2015 remained flat due to an increase in income subject to tax in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our 2016 effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate where we have the asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and the recognition of certain tax benefits from share-based award activities after the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the mix of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate where we have the ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest those earnings, as well as a number of other factors, including integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, research tax credits, share-based compensation, settlement of tax contingency items, and the impact of new legislation.The portion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. Our ability to assert our intention to indefinitely reinvest those future earnings will depend upon the amount, location, and cost of deploying those earnings to where they are needed by the business.Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase following an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.The accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the benefits taken on our tax return which depends upon the share price at the time of employee award vesting.We anticipate our 2017 annual effective tax rate will be lower than 2016. We anticipate that more of our income before provision for income taxes will be earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate where we intend to assert to indefinitely reinvest those earnings which we expect will result in a lower effective tax rate for 2017. In addition, we anticipate that ASU 2016-09 will further lower our effective tax rate, relative to the U.S. statutory rate, if our share price remains constant to the January 31, 2017 price of $130.32. As ASU 2016-09 requires recognition of certain tax benefits on a discrete basis, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period. If our share price remains constant to the January 31, 2017 price, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be lower in the first quarter of 2017 and increase in the remaining quarters throughout the year.Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2016, our net unrecognized tax benefits are $2.43 billion accrued as other liabilities and are predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described above and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we believe it is unlikely that a material change to our unrecognized tax benefits will occur within the next 12 months. We expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions and anticipate that the amount accrued will be similar to 2016. Absent any unanticipated event, we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2017.45Quarterly Results of Operations DataThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2016. We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We elected to early adopt ASU 2016-09 in the fourth quarter of 2016. As such, certain consolidated statements of income data for the three months ended December 31, 2016, September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016, and March 31, 2016 included the impacts of early adoption of ASU 2016-09. See Note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to this adoption. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data.

The impacts of adoption have been reflected retrospectively in certain of our consolidated statements of cash flows data for all periods presented. Share-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact the adoption. See Note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this adoption.Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $29.45 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $11.02 billion from December 31, 2015, primarily due to $16.11 billion of cash generated from operations, partially offset by $4.49 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $312 million for principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations.Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $1.21 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $3.14 billion, although we anticipate only a relatively small portion of this will be available to offset our federal taxable income in 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we had $312 million of federal tax credits, of which a substantial portion will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2017. We expect that the amount of cash paid for income taxes will significantly increase in 2017. In May 2016, we terminated our undrawn five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to $6.5 billion and entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2016 Facility). Any amounts outstanding under the 2016 Facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2016, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our Class A common stock commencing in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). As of December 31, 2016, $5.10 billion of the $29.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary.48In January 2017, we began funding withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. We expect this net share settlement approach will increase our cash outflows and reduce the number of shares that will be issued in connection with the vesting of our employee equity awards. If we had used the net share settlement approach in 2016, our cash outflows would have increased by approximately $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the number of shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with the vesting of employee equity awards during this period would have decreased by approximately 20 million shares.We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash flow from operating activities during 2016, mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.22 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $2.34 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015, was mostly due to an increase in net income, including the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.Cash flow from operating activities during 2015, mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $2.96 billion, total depreciation and amortization of $1.95 billion, and tax benefit from share-based award activity of $1.72 billion, which had been reclassified from financing activity as a result of ASU 2016-09 adoption. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for share-based compensation expense, and higher income tax payable as of December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.Cash flow from operating activities during 2014, primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as tax benefit from share-based award activity of $1.85 billion, which had been reclassified from financing activity as a result of ASU 2016-09 adoption, share-based compensation expense of $1.79 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.24 billion. The cash flow from operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.44 billion, as adjusted for certain non-cash items described above, partially offset by a decrease in income tax refunds of $415 million.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $11.74 billion during 2016, mostly due to $7.19 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $4.49 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was mostly due to increases in capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities.Cash used in investing activities during 2015, primarily resulted from $6.70 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $2.52 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office buildings. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets.Cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily resulted from $4.98 billion for the acquisition of businesses and $1.83 billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings, partially offset by $1.24 billion for the net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly due to increases in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets, and capital expenditures, partially offset by net sales of marketable securities.We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2017 of approximately $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2016, mostly consisted of principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations. The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to full repayment of our capital lease and other financing obligations in 2016.Cash used in financing activities during 2015, primarily consisted of principal payments on capital lease obligations. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions.Cash used in financing activities during 2014 was $298 million, which primarily resulted from $243 million of payments related to our capital lease transactions, and $55 million of other financing activities.49Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for offices, land, facilities, and data centers. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2016 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations$1,964 $277 $549 $405 $733Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility(1)476 — 7 71 398Other contractual commitments(2)1,244 741 153 52 298Total contractual obligations$3,684 $1,018 $709 $528 $1,429(1)Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility represents our commitments to lease certain office buildings that are currently under construction. As of December 31, 2016, $112 million of the total obligation was recorded as a liability and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 9 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this financing obligation.(2)Other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure and our data center operations.In addition, our other liabilities include $2.43 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.ContingenciesWe are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other legal proceedings. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. Such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 12 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (ASU 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. We currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective January 1, 2018. The new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modified retrospective method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method. While we are still in the process of completing our analysis on the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we do not expect the impact to be material. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. We are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 50In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers Other than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires companies to recognize the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. We currently anticipate adopting the new standard effective January 1, 2018, and do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18), which requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 51Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have negatively affected our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. We recognized foreign currency losses of $76 million, $66 million, and $87 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $403 million and $173 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.52",2023-12-30 16:18:46.484336
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2018,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Certain revenue information in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue"" is presented on a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2017 using 2016 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2017 Results Our key user metrics and financial results for 2017 are as follows:User growth:•Daily active users (DAUs) were 1.40 billion on average for December 2017, an increase of 14% year-over-year.•Monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.13 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of 14% year-over-year.Financial results:•Revenue was $40.65 billion, up 47% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $39.94 billion, up 49% year-over-year.•Total costs and expenses were $20.45 billion.•Income from operations was $20.20 billion.•Net income was $15.93 billion with diluted earnings per share of $5.39.•Capital expenditures were $6.73 billion.•Effective tax rate was 23%.•Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.71 billion as of December 31, 2017.•Headcount was 25,105 as of December 31, 2017.In 2017, we continued to focus on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping businesses expand their use of our mobile products, (ii) developing innovative ad products that help businesses get the most of their ad campaigns, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through our targeting capabilities and outcome-based measurement.We continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform as well as video, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases, such as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we anticipate that additional investments in the following areas will drive significant year-over-year expense growth in 2018: (i) increased investments in security, video content, and our long-term technology initiatives, and (ii) scaling our headcount and expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our growth.34Trends in Our User MetricsThe numbers for our key metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. In addition, other user engagement metrics do not include Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus unless otherwise specifically stated.Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement.Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 35Worldwide DAUs increased 14% to 1.40 billion on average during December 2017 from 1.23 billion during December 2016. Users in India, Indonesia, and Brazil represented key sources of growth in DAUs during December 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community.As of December 31, 2017, we had 2.13 billion MAUs, an increase of 14% from December 31, 2016. Users in India, Indonesia, and Vietnam represented key sources of growth in 2017, relative to the same period in 2016.36Trends in Our Monetization by User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or virtual reality platform devices are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. Revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2017 in the United States & Canada region was more than nine times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.Note: Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 37For 2017, worldwide ARPU was $20.21, an increase of 26% from 2016. Over this period, ARPU increased by 41% in Europe, 36% in United States & Canada, 33% in Rest of World, and 22% in Asia-Pacific. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.38Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.39We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 12 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible AssetsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2017, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.40Components of Results of OperationsRevenueAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Payments and other fees. Payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure. Our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices, and various other sources.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold, and amortization of intangible assets.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.Marketing and sales. Our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, professional services such as content reviewers, as well as amortization of intangible assets.General and administrative. The majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include legal-related costs and professional services. 41Results of OperationsThe following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue$40,653 $27,638 $17,928Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue5,454 3,789 2,867Research and development7,754 5,919 4,816Marketing and sales4,725 3,772 2,725General and administrative2,517 1,731 1,295Total costs and expenses20,450 15,211 11,703Income from operations20,203 12,427 6,225Interest and other income (expense), net391 91 (31)Income before provision for income taxes20,594 12,518 6,194Provision for income taxes4,660 2,301 2,506Net income$15,934 $10,217 $3,688Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in millions)Cost of revenue$178 $113 $81Research and development2,820 2,494 2,350Marketing and sales436 368 320General and administrative289 243 218Total share-based compensation expense$3,723 $3,218 $2,969 The following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue100% 100% 100%Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue13 14 16Research and development19 21 27Marketing and sales12 14 15General and administrative6 6 7Total costs and expenses50 55 65Income from operations50 45 35Interest and other income (expense), net1 — —Income before provision for income taxes51 45 35Provision for income taxes11 8 14Net income39% 37% 21%42Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Cost of revenue—% —% —%Research and development7 9 13Marketing and sales1 1 2General and administrative1 1 1Total share-based compensation expense9% 12% 17% Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs 2016% Change 2016 vs 2015 % Change 2017 2016 2015 (in millions) Advertising$39,942 $26,885 $17,079 49 % 57 %Payments and other fees711 753 849 (6)% (11)%Total revenue$40,653 $27,638 $17,928 47 % 54 % 2017 Compared to 2016. Revenue in 2017 increased $13.02 billion, or 47%, compared to 2016. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue, partially offset by the continuing decline in Payments revenue. The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices. For 2017, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 88% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 83% in 2016. Factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2017 included (i) an increase in average price per ad, (ii) an increase in users and their engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on mobile devices. We anticipate that advertising revenue growth will continue to be driven primarily by price rather than increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed.In 2017 compared to 2016, the average price per ad increased by 29%, as compared with approximately 5% in 2016, and the number of ads delivered increased by 15%, as compared with approximately 50% in 2016. The increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory; factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on News Feed, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content and other product changes.Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 26%, 27%, and 31% between the third and fourth quarters of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 declined 9% and 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.Payments and other fees revenue in 2017 decreased $42 million, or 6%, compared to 2016. The decline in Payments and other fees revenue was primarily due to decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers, partially offset by the revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices. We anticipate Payments revenue will continue to decline, and such decline will be offset by increases in revenue from various other sources.2016 Compared to 2015. Revenue in 2016 increased $9.71 billion, or 54%, compared to 2015. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue.The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed. For 2016, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 83% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 77% in 2015. Factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2016 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, (ii) an increase in user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in News Feed, as well as the quality, 43relevance, and performance of those ads. In 2016 compared to 2015, the average price per ad increased by 5% and the number of ads delivered increased by 50%. The increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in News Feed while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising growth.Payments and other fees revenue in 2016 decreased $96 million, or 11%, compared to 2015. The majority of the decrease in Payments and other fees revenue was due to decreased Payments revenue from games played on personal computers. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue The general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 had a favorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $40.36 billion and $39.65 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $293 million and $292 million lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2017.The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2016 using 2015 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $27.91 billion and $27.15 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, revenue and advertising revenue would have been $270 million and $269 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2016.Cost of revenue Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs 2016% Change 2016 vs 2015 % Change (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue$5,454 $3,789 $2,867 44% 32%Percentage of revenue13% 14% 16% 2017 Compared to 2016. Cost of revenue in 2017 increased $1.67 billion, or 44%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with partnership agreements, including content acquisition costs, and ads payment processing. 2016 Compared to 2015. Cost of revenue in 2016 increased $922 million, or 32%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements. In 2018, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements.Research and development Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs 2016% Change 2016 vs 2015 % Change (dollars in millions) Research and development$7,754 $5,919 $4,816 31% 23%Percentage of revenue19% 21% 27% 2017 Compared to 2016. Research and development expenses in 2017 increased $1.84 billion, or 31%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 49% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in engineering and other technical functions, partially offset by a $262 million decrease in share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014.442016 Compared to 2015. Research and development expenses in 2016 increased $1.10 billion, or 23%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 34% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 in engineering and other technical functions. Additionally, our equipment and related expenses in 2016 to support our research and development efforts increased $170 million compared to 2015.In 2018, we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees, and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives.Marketing and sales Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs 2016% Change 2016 vs 2015 % Change (dollars in millions) Marketing and sales$4,725 $3,772 $2,725 25% 38%Percentage of revenue12% 14% 15% 2017 Compared to 2016. Marketing and sales expenses in 2017 increased $953 million, or 25%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 35% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in our marketing and sales functions, and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees. Additionally, our marketing expenses increased $196 million in 2017, compared to 2016.2016 Compared to 2015. Marketing and sales expenses in 2016 increased $1.05 billion, or 38%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 28% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 in our marketing and sales functions, and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees. Additionally, our marketing expenses increased $344 million in 2016, compared to 2015.In 2018, we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and partnership efforts and to increase our investment in security efforts through the hiring of employees and content reviewers.General and administrative Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs 2016% Change 2016 vs 2015 % Change (dollars in millions) General and administrative$2,517 $1,731 $1,295 45% 34%Percentage of revenue6% 6% 7% 2017 Compared to 2016. General and administrative expenses in 2017 increased $786 million, or 45%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 58% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in general and administrative functions, and to a lesser extent, higher legal-related costs.2016 Compared to 2015. General and administrative expenses in 2016 increased $436 million, or 34%, compared to 2015. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 43% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 in general and administrative functions, and to a lesser extent, higher professional services and legal fees.In 2018, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth.45Interest and other income (expense), net Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs 2016% Change 2016 vs 2015 % Change (in millions) Interest income, net$392 $166 $29 136% NMOther expense, net(1) (75) (60) 99% (25)%Interest and other income (expense), net$391 $91 $(31) NM NM 2017 Compared to 2016. Interest and other income, net in 2017 increased $300 million compared to 2016. The majority of the increase in 2017 was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. In addition, foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase in 2017.2016 Compared to 2015. Interest and other income (expense), net in 2016 increased $122 million compared to 2015. Interest income, net increased mostly due to increases in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. In addition, the majority of the increase in other expense, net was due to foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities.Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs 2016% Change 2016 vs 2015 % Change (dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes$4,660 $2,301 $2,506 103% (8)%Effective tax rate23% 18% 40% 2017 Compared to 2016. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 increased $2.36 billion, or 103%, compared to 2016, mostly due to the effects of the Tax Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017 and an increase in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation. As a result of the Tax Act, we recognized a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings, remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reassessed the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which increased our provision for income taxes in 2017 by $2.27 billion. Our effective tax rate in 2017 increased compared to 2016, mostly due to the Tax Act and a decrease in the tax rate benefit from share-based compensation compared to 2016. These effects were partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. In 2017, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $1.25 billion and our effective tax rate by six percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. For comparison, in 2016, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $934 million and our effective tax rate by seven percentage points, as compared to the tax rate without such benefits.2016 Compared to 2015. Our provision for income taxes in 2016 decreased $205 million, or 8%, compared to 2015, primarily due to recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation in our provision for income taxes resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09, partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate in 2016 decreased compared to 2015 due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate where we had asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest certain of those earnings, as well as due to a lower increase in our unrecognized tax benefit in 2016 compared to 2015 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2016.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the United States and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate, as well as a number of other factors, including excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, changes to our provisional accounting for the effects of the Tax Act during the measurement period, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the impact of new legislation.The portion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. 46Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.The accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting.Absent unanticipated events and unexpected effects of the Tax Act, we anticipate our effective tax rate in 2018 will be lower than it was in 2017. Our 2017 effective tax rate was significantly affected by the Tax Act. In addition, since we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period. If our stock price remains constant to the January 31, 2018 price, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be lower in the first quarter of 2018 and increase in the remaining quarters throughout the year.Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2017, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $2.75 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months. In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the IRS prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of approximately $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the United States Tax Court challenging the Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and penalties. If the IRS prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position, the assessed tax, interest and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. As of December 31, 2017, we have not resolved this matter and proceedings continue in the United States Tax Court. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations.We expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions and anticipate that the amount for future quarters accrued will be similar to amounts accrued in 2017. Absent unanticipated events, we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2018.47Quarterly Results of Operations DataThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2017. We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period.

Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.71 billion as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.26 billion from December 31, 2016, mostly due to $24.22 billion of cash generated from operations, partially offset by $6.73 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $3.25 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $1.98 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock.Cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $2.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax liability of $2.9 billion relating to the one-time mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings which we intend to pay over an eight-year payment schedule as prescribed by the Tax Act. In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 billion share repurchase program of our Class A common stock that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. During 2017, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 13 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $2.07 billion.In January 2017, we began funding withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share settlement, rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. In 2017, we paid $3.25 billion of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards.As of December 31, 2017, $15.89 billion of the $41.71 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash flow from operating activities during 2017 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.72 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $3.03 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016, was mostly due to an increase in net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense. Due to the enactment of the Tax Act in 2017, we recorded a provisional tax liability of $2.9 billion relating to the one-time mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings,which also contributed to the increase in 2017 compared to 2016.50Cash flow from operating activities during 2016 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.22 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $2.34 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015, was mostly due to an increase in net income, including the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense. Cash flow from operating activities during 2015 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $2.96 billion, total depreciation and amortization of $1.95 billion, and tax benefit from share-based award activity of $1.72 billion, which had been reclassified from financing activity as a result of ASU 2016-09 adoption. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for share-based compensation expense, and higher income tax payable as of December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during 2017 mostly resulted from $13.25 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $6.73 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures.Cash used in investing activities during 2016 mostly resulted from $7.19 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $4.49 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was mostly due to increases in capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities.Cash used in investing activities during 2015 primarily resulted from $6.70 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $2.52 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office buildings. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets.We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $14.0 billion to $15.0 billion.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2017 mostly consisted of $3.25 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $1.98 billion paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was mostly due to taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and repurchases of our Class A common stock that commenced in 2017.Cash used in financing activities during 2016 mostly consisted of principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations. The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to full repayment of our capital lease and other financing obligations in 2016.Cash used in financing activities during 2015 primarily consisted of principal payments on capital lease obligations. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017.51Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for offices, land, facilities, colocations, and data centers, as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2017 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating lease obligations$4,644 $409 $934 $878 $2,423Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility(1)195 — 16 30 149Other contractual commitments(2)2,953 1,830 346 100 677Total contractual obligations$7,792 $2,239 $1,296 $1,008 $3,249(1) Financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility represents our commitments to lease certain office buildings that are currently under construction. As of December 31, 2017, $72 million of the total obligation was recorded as a liability and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 9 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this financing obligation.(2) Other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure and our data center operations.As part of the normal course of the business, we may enter into multi-year agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $4.0 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased. In addition, our other liabilities include $2.75 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2017. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 12 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (ASU 2016-08) which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new standard further requires new disclosures about contracts with customers, including the significant judgments the company has made when applying the guidance. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. We finalized our analysis and the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our internal controls over financial reporting. In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. This 52guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2019. We have selected a lease accounting system and we are in the process of implementing such system as well as evaluating the use of the optional practical expedients. While we continue to evaluate the effect of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, we expect our operating leases, as disclosed in Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, will be subject to the new standard. We will recognize right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, which will increase our total assets and liabilities.In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers Other than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires companies to recognize the income-tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. A cumulative-effect adjustment will capture the write-off of income tax consequences deferred from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, new deferred tax assets, and other liabilities for amounts not currently recognized under U.S. GAAP. Based on transactions up to December 31, 2017, we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18), which requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the retrospective transition approach for all periods presented. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01), which revises the definition of a business and provides new guidance in evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018, on a prospective basis and do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.53Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. We recognized foreign currency losses of $6 million, $76 million, and $66 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $611 million and $403 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.54",2023-12-30 16:18:46.196180
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2019,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Certain revenue information in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue"" is presented on a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2018 using 2017 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2018 Results Our key user metrics and financial results for 2018 are as follows:User growth:•Daily active users (DAUs) were 1.52 billion on average for December 2018, an increase of 9% year-over-year.•Monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.32 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 9% year-over-year.Financial results:•Revenue was $55.84 billion, up 37% year-over-year, and ad revenue was $55.01 billion, up 38% year-over-year.•Total costs and expenses were $30.93 billion.•Income from operations was $24.91 billion.•Net income was $22.11 billion with diluted earnings per share of $7.57.•Capital expenditures were $13.92 billion.•Effective tax rate was 13%.•Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.11 billion as of December 31, 2018.•Headcount was 35,587 as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 42% year-over-year.In 2018, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective.We continued to invest, based on our roadmap, in: (i) our most developed ecosystems, Facebook and Instagram, (ii) driving growth and building ecosystems around our products that already have significant user bases, such as Messenger and WhatsApp, as well as continuing to grow features like Stories, and (iii) long-term technology initiatives, such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality, that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. We intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we anticipate that additional investments in the following areas will continue to drive significant year-over-year expense growth in 2019: (i) expanding our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, and (ii) investments in safety and security, marketing, video content, and our long-term technology initiatives. Expense growth exceeded revenue growth in 2018, which we anticipate will continue in 2019.35Trends in Our User MetricsThe numbers for our key metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. In addition, other user engagement metrics do not include Instagram, WhatsApp, or Oculus unless otherwise specifically stated.Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 36Worldwide DAUs increased 9% to 1.52 billion on average during December 2018 from 1.40 billion during December 2017. Users in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines represented key sources of growth in DAUs during December 2018, relative to the same period in 2017.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.As of December 31, 2018, we had 2.32 billion MAUs, an increase of 9% from December 31, 2017. Users in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines represented key sources of growth in 2018, relative to the same period in 2017.37Trends in Our Monetization by User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware devices are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. Revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2018 in the United States & Canada region was more than ten times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.Note: Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the customer. 38For 2018, worldwide ARPU was $24.96, an increase of 24% from 2017. Over this period, ARPU increased by 34% in Europe, 33% in United States & Canada, 21% in Rest of World, and 20% in Asia-Pacific. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.39Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us, including a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as determining the transition tax, remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. As a result, we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the Tax Act in our financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our analysis to determine the effect of the Tax Act and recorded immaterial adjustments as of December 31, 2018. Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures 40accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. The outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 12—Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible AssetsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2018, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.41Components of Results of OperationsRevenueAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Payments and other fees. Payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure. Our other fees revenue consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices, as well as revenue from various other sources.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and cost of consumer hardware device inventory sold. Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.Marketing and sales. Our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, share-based compensation, and benefits for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, and professional services such as content reviewers. General and administrative. The majority of our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include legal-related costs and professional services. 42Results of OperationsThe following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue$55,838 $40,653 $27,638Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue9,355 5,454 3,789Research and development10,273 7,754 5,919Marketing and sales7,846 4,725 3,772General and administrative3,451 2,517 1,731Total costs and expenses30,925 20,450 15,211Income from operations24,913 20,203 12,427Interest and other income (expense), net448 391 91Income before provision for income taxes25,361 20,594 12,518Provision for income taxes3,249 4,660 2,301Net income$22,112 $15,934 $10,217Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Cost of revenue$284 $178 $113Research and development3,022 2,820 2,494Marketing and sales511 436 368General and administrative335 289 243Total share-based compensation expense$4,152 $3,723 $3,218 The following tables set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Consolidated Statements of Income Data: Revenue100% 100% 100%Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue17 13 14Research and development18 19 21Marketing and sales14 12 14General and administrative6 6 6Total costs and expenses55 50 55Income from operations45 50 45Interest and other income (expense), net1 1 —Income before provision for income taxes45 51 45Provision for income taxes6 11 8Net income40% 39% 37%43Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Cost of revenue1% —% —%Research and development5 7 9Marketing and sales1 1 1General and administrative1 1 1Total share-based compensation expense7% 9% 12% Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs 2017 % Change 2017 vs 2016 % Change 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Advertising$55,013 $39,942 $26,885 38% 49 %Payments and other fees825 711 753 16% (6)%Total revenue$55,838 $40,653 $27,638 37% 47 % 2018 Compared to 2017. Revenue in 2018 increased $15.19 billion, or 37%, compared to 2017. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue. The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices. For 2018, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 92% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 88% in 2017. The increase in advertising revenue for 2018 was due to increases in the number of ads delivered and the average price per ad. In 2018 compared to 2017, the number of ads delivered increased by 22%, as compared with approximately 15% in 2017, and the average price per ad increased by 13%, as compared with approximately 29% in 2017. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement, and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products. The increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory. Factors contributing to the increase in demand for our ad inventory include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. We anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads displayed. Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 23%, 26%, and 27% between the third and fourth quarters of 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 declined 8% and 9% compared to the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.2017 Compared to 2016. Revenue in 2017 increased $13.02 billion, or 47%, compared to 2016. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue.The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices. For 2017, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 88% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 83% in 2016. Factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2017 included (i) an increase in average price per ad, (ii) an increase in users and their engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on mobile devices. In 2017 compared to 2016, the average price per ad increased by 29%, as compared with approximately 5% in 2016, and the number of ads delivered increased by 15%, as compared with approximately 50% in 2016. The increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory; factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on News Feed, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content and other product 44changes. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue The general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, and in the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, had a favorable impact on our revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2018 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $55.44 billion and $54.61 billion, respectively. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2017 using 2016 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $40.36 billion and $39.65 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, both total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $401 million lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2018, and $293 million and $292 million lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2017.Cost of revenue Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 % Change 2017 vs 2016 % Change (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue$9,355 $5,454 $3,789 72% 44%Percentage of revenue17% 13% 14% 2018 Compared to 2017. Cost of revenue in 2018 increased $3.90 billion, or 72%, compared to 2017. The increase was mostly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and higher costs associated with partnership agreements, including traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs. 2017 Compared to 2016. Cost of revenue in 2017 increased $1.67 billion, or 44%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, higher costs associated with partnership agreements, including content acquisition costs, and ads payment processing.In 2019, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements.Research and development Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 % Change 2017 vs 2016 % Change (dollars in millions) Research and development$10,273 $7,754 $5,919 32% 31%Percentage of revenue18% 19% 21% 2018 Compared to 2017. Research and development expenses in 2018 increased $2.52 billion, or 32%, compared to 2017. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense as a result of a 43% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 in engineering and other technical functions, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in professional service expenses. Payroll and benefits expense growth was less than headcount growth partially due to a $473 million decrease in share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014.2017 Compared to 2016. Research and development expenses in 2017 increased $1.84 billion, or 31%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 49% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in engineering and other technical functions, partially offset by a $262 million decrease in share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014. 45In 2019, we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees, and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives. We expect payroll and related expenses growth to be more consistent with headcount growth as share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014 are now substantially recognized.Marketing and sales Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 % Change 2017 vs 2016 % Change (dollars in millions) Marketing and sales$7,846 $4,725 $3,772 66% 25%Percentage of revenue14% 12% 14% 2018 Compared to 2017. Marketing and sales expenses in 2018 increased $3.12 billion, or 66%, compared to 2017. The increase was mostly driven by marketing, community operations, and payroll and benefits expenses. Our payroll and benefits expenses increased as a result of a 33% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 in our marketing and sales functions.2017 Compared to 2016. Marketing and sales expenses in 2017 increased $953 million, or 25%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 35% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in our marketing and sales functions, and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees. In 2019, we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and partnership efforts and to increase our investment in community operations to support our security efforts. General and administrative Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 % Change 2017 vs 2016 % Change (dollars in millions) General and administrative$3,451 $2,517 $1,731 37% 45%Percentage of revenue6% 6% 6% 2018 Compared to 2017. General and administrative expenses in 2018 increased $934 million, or 37%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 32% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 in general and administrative functions.2017 Compared to 2016. General and administrative expenses in 2017 increased $786 million, or 45%, compared to 2016. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 58% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 in general and administrative functions, and to a lesser extent, higher legal-related costs.In 2019, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth.Interest and other income (expense), net Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 % Change 2017 vs 2016 % Change (in millions) Interest income, net$652 $392 $166 66% 136%Other income (expense), net(204) (1) (75) NM 99%Interest and other income (expense), net$448 $391 $91 15% NM 462018 Compared to 2017. Interest and other income, net in 2018 increased $57 million compared to 2017. The increase in 2018 was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by an increase in other expense as a result of foreign exchange impact occurring from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances.2017 Compared to 2016. Interest and other income, net in 2017 increased $300 million compared to 2016. The majority of the increase in 2017 was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates. In addition, foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase in 2017.Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs 2017 % Change 2017 vs 2016 % Change (dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes$3,249 $4,660 $2,301 (30)% 103%Effective tax rate13% 23% 18% 2018 Compared to 2017. Our provision for income taxes in 2018 decreased $1.41 billion, or 30%, compared to 2017, primarily due to a one-time expense of approximately $2.27 billion in 2017 resulting from the Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes.Our effective tax rate in 2018 decreased compared to 2017, primarily due to a one-time tax expense of approximately $2.27 billion related to the Tax Act in 2017.2017 Compared to 2016. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 increased $2.36 billion, or 103%, compared to 2016, mostly due to the effects of the Tax Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017 and an increase in income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation. As a result of the Tax Act, we recognized a one-time mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings, remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reassessed the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which increased our provision for income taxes in 2017 by $2.27 billion. Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the United States and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate, as well as a number of other factors, including excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the impact of changes in tax law.The proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. The accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 28, 2019 price, we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 will be a few percentage points higher than our 2018 rate. Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court (Tax Court) issued an opinion in Altera Corp v. Commissioner (Tax Court Opinion), which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Opinion was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion (Ninth Circuit Opinion) that reversed the Tax Court Opinion. The Ninth Circuit Opinion was subsequently withdrawn and the case is being reheard. Since the Ninth Circuit Opinion was withdrawn, we continue to treat our share-based compensation expense in accordance with the Tax Court Opinion. We also continue to monitor developments in this case and any impact the final opinion could have on our consolidated financial statements. Had the Ninth Circuit not withdrawn its opinion, our effective tax rate for 2018 would have been higher.47Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2018, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $3.07 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below, the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, and excluding the effects of the Altera Corp v. Commissioner case that we are monitoring, we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months. In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010, which, if the IRS prevails in its position, could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $5.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions, related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2018, we have not resolved these matters, and proceedings continue in Tax Court. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 48Quarterly Results of Operations DataThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2018. We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period.

Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $41.11 billion as of December 31, 2018, a decrease of $597 million from December 31, 2017, mostly due to $13.92 billion for purchases of property and equipment, $12.88 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $3.21 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, offset by $29.27 billion of cash generated from operations and a $500 million increase in overdraft in cash pooling entities.Cash paid for income taxes was $3.76 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $7.88 billion, and we anticipate that none of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had $290 million of federal tax credit carryforward, of which none will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2018. In addition, we are monitoring the Altera Corp. v. Commissioner case as it applies to our facts and circumstances as it could increase our cash paid for income taxes. In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2018, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. During the second quarter of 2018, we completed repurchases under the original authorization to purchase up to $6.0 billion of our Class A common stock. In April 2018, the authorization for the repurchase of our Class A common stock was increased by an additional $9.0 billion, and we completed repurchases under this authorization during the fourth quarter of 2018. In December 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $9.0 billion of repurchases under this program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased and subsequently retired 79 million shares of our Class A common stock for $12.93 billion. As of December 31, 2018, $9.0 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In 2018, we paid $3.21 billion of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards.In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. See Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our notional cash pooling arrangement.As of December 31, 2018, $16.28 billion of the $41.11 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.51Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash flow from operating activities during 2018 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as total depreciation and amortization of $4.32 billion and share-based compensation expense of $4.15 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to an increase in net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax and share-based compensation expense. Due to the enactment of the Tax Act in 2017, we recorded a higher tax liability in 2017, which partially offset the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2018. Cash flow from operating activities during 2017 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.72 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $3.03 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was mostly due to an increase in net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense. Due to the enactment of the Tax Act in 2017, we recorded a provisional tax liability of $2.9 billion relating to the one-time mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings, which also contributed to the increase in 2017 compared to 2016. Cash flow from operating activities during 2016 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $3.22 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $2.34 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015, was mostly due to an increase in net income, including the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during 2018 mostly resulted from $13.92 billion of capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office buildings, offset by $2.47 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to a decrease in the net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.Cash used in investing activities during 2017 mostly resulted from $13.25 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $6.73 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures.Cash used in investing activities during 2016 mostly resulted from $7.19 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $4.49 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was mostly due to increases in capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities.We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2019 of approximately $18 billion to $20 billion.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2018 consisted of $12.88 billion paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $3.21 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, offset by a $500 million overdraft in cash pooling entities. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to an increase in repurchases of our Class A common stock, partially offset by an increase in overdraft balances in cash pooling entities.Cash used in financing activities during 2017 mostly consisted of $3.25 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $1.98 billion paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was mostly due to taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and repurchases of our Class A common stock that commenced in 2017.Cash used in financing activities during 2016 mostly consisted of principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations. The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to full repayment of our capital lease and other financing obligations in 2016.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018.52Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases, which include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, land, and colocation leases, as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 ThereafterOperating lease obligations$14,651 $698 $2,001 $2,102 $9,850Transition tax payable1,587 — — 324 1,263Other contractual commitments(1)6,173 3,377 1,135 238 1,423Total contractual obligations$22,411 $4,075 $3,136 $2,664 $12,536(1) Other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure and our data center operations.As part of the normal course of the business, we may enter into multi-year agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $6.0 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased. In addition, our other liabilities include $3.07 billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 12—Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02), as amended, which generally requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and will not restate comparative periods. We will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allows us to carryforward our historical lease classification, our assessment on whether a contract is or contains a lease, and our initial direct costs for any leases that exist prior to adoption of the new standard. We will also elect to combine lease and non-lease components and to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We estimate approximately $6 billion would be recognized as total right-of-use assets and total lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. Other than disclosed, we do not expect the new standard to have a material impact on our remaining consolidated financial statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (ASU 2017-04), which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 53Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. We recognized foreign currency losses of $213 million, $6 million, and $76 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $468 million and $611 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.54",2023-12-30 16:18:46.340615
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2020,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Certain revenue information in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue"" is presented on a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2019 using 2018 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2019 Results Our key community metrics and financial results for 2019 are as follows:Community growth:•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.66 billion on average for December 2019, an increase of 9% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.50 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 8% year-over-year.•Family daily active people (DAP) was 2.26 billion on average for December 2019, an increase of 11% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 2.89 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 9% year-over-year.Financial results:•Revenue was $70.70 billion, up 27% year-over-year, and advertising revenue was $69.66 billion, up 27% year-over-year.•Total costs and expenses were $46.71 billion.•Income from operations was $23.99 billion and operating margin was 34%. •Net income was $18.48 billion with diluted earnings per share of $6.43.•Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $15.65 billion.•Effective tax rate was 25.5%.•Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $54.86 billion as of December 31, 2019.•Headcount was 44,942 as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 26% year-over-year.In 2019, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective.We invested based on the following company priorities that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world. We intend to continue to invest based on these priorities, and we anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2020. 44Table of ContentsTrends in Our Facebook User MetricsThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 45Table of ContentsWorldwide DAUs increased 9% to 1.66 billion on average during December 2019 from 1.52 billion during December 2018. Users in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines represented key sources of growth in DAUs during December 2019, relative to the same period in 2018.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.As of December 31, 2019, we had 2.50 billion MAUs, an increase of 8% from December 31, 2018. Users in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines represented key sources of growth in 2019, relative to the same period in 2018.46Table of ContentsTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by Facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware devices are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. The share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2019 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region. Note: Our revenue by Facebook user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our Facebook users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the billing address of the customer. 47Table of ContentsOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2019, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $29.25, an increase of 17% from 2018. Over this period, ARPU increased by 24% in the United States & Canada, 20% in Europe, 18% in Asia‑Pacific, and 16% in Rest of World. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.48Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family Metrics The numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as MAP or DAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products. Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our ""Family"" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Worldwide DAP increased 11% to 2.26 billion on average during December 2019 from 2.03 billion during December 2018. 49Table of Contents•Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.As of December 31, 2019, we had 2.89 billion MAP, an increase of 9% from 2.64 billion as of December 31, 2018. 50Table of Contents•Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the definition of MAP above. The share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material. Our annual worldwide ARPP in 2019, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $25.57, an increase of 14% from 2018.51Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.52Table of ContentsWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss. The outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14—Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Valuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Estimated Useful Lives We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2019, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.The useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense.53Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenueAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Other revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices and net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, as well as revenue from various other sources.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and cost of consumer hardware devices sold. Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, share-based compensation, and facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We currently expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures and professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of legal-related costs; salaries and benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; and professional services. Results of OperationsIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, please refer to Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.54Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Revenue$70,697 $55,838 $40,653Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue12,770 9,355 5,454Research and development13,600 10,273 7,754Marketing and sales9,876 7,846 4,725General and administrative10,465 3,451 2,517Total costs and expenses46,711 30,925 20,450Income from operations23,986 24,913 20,203Interest and other income, net826 448 391Income before provision for income taxes24,812 25,361 20,594Provision for income taxes6,327 3,249 4,660Net income$18,485 $22,112 $15,934The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue)(1): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017Revenue100% 100% 100%Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue18 17 13Research and development19 18 19Marketing and sales14 14 12General and administrative15 6 6Total costs and expenses66 55 50Income from operations34 45 50Interest and other income, net1 1 1Income before provision for income taxes35 45 51Provision for income taxes9 6 11Net income26% 40% 39%_________________________(1)Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in millions)Cost of revenue$377 $284 $178Research and development3,488 3,022 2,820Marketing and sales569 511 436General and administrative402 335 289Total share-based compensation expense$4,836 $4,152 $3,723 55Table of ContentsShare-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue)(1): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017Cost of revenue1% 1% —%Research and development5 5 7Marketing and sales1 1 1General and administrative1 1 1Total share-based compensation expense7% 7% 9% _________________________(1)Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs 2018 % Change 2018 vs 2017 % Change 2019 2018 2017 (in millions) Advertising$69,655 $55,013 $39,942 27% 38%Other revenue1,042 825 711 26% 16%Total revenue$70,697 $55,838 $40,653 27% 37% 2019 Compared to 2018. Revenue in 2019 increased $14.86 billion, or 27%, compared to 2018. The increase was almost entirely due to an increase in advertising revenue as a result of an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average price per ad.In 2019, the number of ads delivered increased by 33%, as compared with approximately 22% in 2018. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products, and an increase in users and their engagement. In 2019, the average price per ad decreased by 5%, as compared with an increase of approximately 13% in 2018. The decrease in average price per ad was primarily driven by an increasing proportion of the number of ads delivered as Stories ads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates. We anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined by a combination of the number of ads delivered and price.Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 19%, 23%, and 26% between the third and fourth quarters of 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 declined 10% and 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2019 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $72.37 billion and $71.32 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $1.67 billion and $1.66 billion, respectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2019, and $16.53 billion and $16.31 billion higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2018.56Table of ContentsCost of revenue Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs 2018 % Change 2018 vs 2017 % Change (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue$12,770 $9,355 $5,454 37% 72%Percentage of revenue18% 17% 13% 2019 Compared to 2018. Cost of revenue in 2019 increased $3.42 billion, or 37%, compared to 2018. The increase was mostly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, as well as higher cost of consumer hardware devices sold and traffic acquisition costs. In 2020, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with various partner arrangements. Research and development Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs 2018 % Change 2018 vs 2017 % Change (dollars in millions) Research and development$13,600 $10,273 $7,754 32% 32%Percentage of revenue19% 18% 19% 2019 Compared to 2018. Research and development expenses in 2019 increased $3.33 billion, or 32%, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses and facilities-related costs as a result of a 31% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 in engineering and other technical functions.In 2020, we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees, and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives.Marketing and sales Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs 2018 % Change 2018 vs 2017 % Change (dollars in millions) Marketing and sales$9,876 $7,846 $4,725 26% 66%Percentage of revenue14% 14% 12% 2019 Compared to 2018. Marketing and sales expenses in 2019 increased $2.03 billion, or 26%, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increases in marketing expenses, payroll and benefits expenses, and community and product operations expenses. Our payroll and benefits expenses increased as a result of a 23% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 in our marketing and sales functions.In 2020, we anticipate that marketing expense will increase and plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and partnership efforts and to increase our investment in community and product operations to support our security efforts.57Table of ContentsGeneral and administrative Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs 2018 % Change 2018 vs 2017 % Change (dollars in millions) Legal accrual related to FTC settlement$5,000 $— $— NM NMOther general and administrative5,465 3,451 2,517 58% 37%General and administrative$10,465 $3,451 $2,517 203% 37%Percentage of revenue15% 6% 6% 2019 Compared to 2018. General and administrative expenses in 2019 increased $7.01 billion, or 203%, compared to 2018. The majority of the increase was due to the $5.0 billion FTC settlement expense recorded in the first six months of 2019. In addition, other general and administrative expense increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in other legal-related costs and higher payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 31% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 in our general and administrative functions.In 2020, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth.Interest and other income, net Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs 2018 % Change 2018 vs 2017 % Change (in millions) Interest income, net$904 $652 $392 39% 66%Other income (expense), net(78) (204) (1) NM NMInterest and other income, net$826 $448 $391 84% 15% 2019 Compared to 2018. Interest and other income, net in 2019 increased $378 million compared to 2018. The increase was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher investment balances and interest rates and a decrease in other expense as a result of lower foreign exchange losses as compared to 2018 due to foreign currency transactions and re-measurement.Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs 2018 % Change 2018 vs 2017 % Change (dollars in millions) Provision for income taxes$6,327 $3,249 $4,660 95% (30)%Effective tax rate25.5% 12.8% 22.6% 2019 Compared to 2018. Our provision for income taxes in 2019 increased $3.08 billion, or 95%, compared to 2018, a majority of which is due to an increase in income taxes from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion discussed below, an increase in income from operations prior to the effect of the legal accrual related to the FTC settlement that is not expected to be tax-deductible, and a decrease in excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation. Our effective tax rate in 2019 increased compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in income taxes from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, the legal accrual related to the FTC settlement that is not expected to be tax-deductible, and a decrease in excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation.On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). 58Table of ContentsOn June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion (Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion) that reversed the Tax Court Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July 22, 2019, the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer has until February 10, 2020 to request a hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States. As a result, the final outcome of the case is uncertain. In November 2019, we made a $1.64 billion payment related to this matter and recorded the payment to net against the tax liability included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. If the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion is reversed, we would anticipate recording an income tax benefit at that time.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the United States and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate, as well as a number of other factors, including excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the impact of changes in tax law.The proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the U.S. statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 23, 2020 price, we expect our effective tax rate for 2020 will be in the high-teens. The range reflects expected effects from a transfer of intellectual property rights between Facebook entities that we anticipate implementing in 2020.Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods. Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2019, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $3.74 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months. In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. The case is scheduled for trial beginning in February 2020. On January 15, 2020, the IRS filed its Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The IRS did not provide any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition 59Table of Contentstax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2019, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.60Table of ContentsQuarterly Results of Operations DataThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2019. We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period.

Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $54.86 billion as of December 31, 2019, an increase of $13.74 billion from December 31, 2018. The majority of the increase was due to $36.31 billion of cash generated from operations, offset by $15.65 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $4.20 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $4.19 billion for net purchases of marketable securities, and $2.34 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.Cash paid for income taxes was $5.18 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $1.64 billion was related to the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion. As of December 31, 2019, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $9.06 billion, and we anticipate that none of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had $357 million of federal tax credit carryforward, of which none will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2019. In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2019, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2018, $9.0 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In 2019, we repurchased and subsequently retired 22 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.10 billion. As of December 31, 2019, $4.90 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2020, an additional $10.0 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. As of December 31, 2019, $19.01 billion of the $54.86 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the inquiry of the FTC into our platform and user data practices, which is pending federal court approval. The settlement requires us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.64Table of ContentsCash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash flow from operating activities during 2019 primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $5.74 billion of depreciation and amortization and $4.84 billion of share-based compensation expense. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher net income prior to the effect of the $5.0 billion FTC legal settlement accrual, an increase in taxes payable, as well as increases in the non-cash items discussed above.Cash flow from operating activities during 2018 mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as total depreciation and amortization of $4.32 billion and share-based compensation expense of $4.15 billion. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to an increase in net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax and share-based compensation expense. Due to the enactment of the Tax Act in 2017, we recorded a higher tax liability in 2017, which partially offset the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2018.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during 2019 mostly resulted from $15.10 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure, and $4.19 billion of net purchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment. Cash used in investing activities during 2018 mostly resulted from $13.92 billion of capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office buildings, offset by $2.47 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to a decrease in the net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $17 billion to $19 billion in 2020.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2019 mostly consisted of $4.20 billion cash used to settle repurchases of our Class A common stock, $2.34 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $552 million of principal payments on finance leases. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock.Cash used in financing activities during 2018 consisted of $12.88 billion paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $3.21 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, offset by $500 million in overdraft balances in cash pooling entities. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to an increase in repurchases of our Class A common stock, partially offset by an increase in overdraft balances in cash pooling entities.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019.65Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist primarily of obligations under operating leases, which include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, land, and colocation leases, as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2019: Payment Due by Period Total 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 Thereafter (in millions)Operating lease obligations, including imputed interest(1)$18,267 $1,085 $2,510 $2,577 $12,095Finance lease obligations, including imputed interest(1)920 246 107 88 479Transition tax payable1,579 — — 880 699Other contractual commitments(2)4,542 2,792 625 170 955Total contractual obligations$25,308 $4,123 $3,242 $3,715 $14,228_________________________(1)Includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.(2)The majority of other contractual commitments were related to network infrastructure and our data center operations.As part of the normal course of the business, we may enter into multi-year agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $4.99 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased. In addition, our other liabilities also include $3.74 billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14—Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.66Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency losses of $105 million, $213 million, and $6 million were recognized in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, as interest and other income, net in our consolidated statements of income.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $525 million and $468 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.67Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:18:42.347064
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2021,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Certain revenue information in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue"" is presented on a constant currency basis. This information is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2020 using 2019 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2020 Results Our key community metrics and financial results for 2020 are as follows:Community growth:•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.84 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 11% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.80 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 12% year-over-year.•Family daily active people (DAP) was 2.60 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 15% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.30 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 14% year-over-year.Financial results:•Revenue was $85.97 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and advertising revenue was $84.17 billion, up 21% year-over-year.•Total costs and expenses were $53.29 billion.•Income from operations was $32.67 billion and operating margin was 38%. •Net income was $29.15 billion with diluted earnings per share of $10.09.•Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $15.72 billion.•Effective tax rate was 12.2%.•Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $61.95 billion as of December 31, 2020.•Headcount was 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 30% year-over-year.Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on helping people stay connected, assisting the public health response, and working on the economic recovery. We have also continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our 52Table of Contentsservices to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world. In 2020, we also continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective.Our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have significantly impacted our business and results of operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen user growth and engagement returning to pre-pandemic trends, particularly in the United States & Canada region. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty, and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility. The COVID-19 pandemic has also previously caused a reduction in the demand for advertising, as well as a related decline in the pricing of our ads, particularly in the second quarter of 2020. More recently, we believe the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online, as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of these trends. However, it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside, which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. The impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of our advertising services, as well as on our overall results of operations, remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers. We intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities, and we anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2021. We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $21-23 billion and total expenses to be in the range of $68-73 billion.53Table of ContentsTrends in Our Facebook User MetricsThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.DAU/MAU:66%66%66%66%66%66%66%66%66%67%66%66%66% DAU/MAU:77%77%77%76%77%77%77%77%77%77%77%77%76%DAU/MAU:75%75%74%74%74%74%74%74%75%75%74%74%74% DAU/MAU:60%61%61%61%61%61%61%62%62%62%61%62%62%DAU/MAU:64%64%64%64%64%64%64%65%65%65%65%65%65%Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 54Table of ContentsWorldwide DAUs increased 11% to 1.84 billion on average during December 2020 from 1.66 billion during December 2019. Users in India, the Philippines, and Indonesia represented key sources of growth in DAUs during December 2020, relative to the same period in 2019.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook. As of December 31, 2020, we had 2.80 billion MAUs, an increase of 12% from December 31, 2019. Users in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines represented key sources of growth in 2020, relative to the same period in 2019.55Table of ContentsTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by Facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware devices are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. The share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2020 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.ARPU:$7.37$6.42$7.05$7.26$8.52$6.95$7.05$7.89$10.14 ARPU:$34.86$30.12$33.27$34.55$41.41$34.18$36.49$39.63$53.56ARPU:$10.98$9.55$10.70$10.68$13.21$10.64$11.03$12.41$16.87 ARPU:$2.96$2.78$3.04$3.24$3.57$3.06$2.99$3.67$4.05ARPU:$2.11$1.89$2.13$2.24$2.48$1.99$1.78$2.22$2.77 Note: Our revenue by Facebook user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our Facebook users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the billing address of the customer. 56Table of ContentsOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $32.03, an increase of 10% from 2019. Over this period, ARPU increased by 18% in the United States & Canada, 15% in Europe, and 9% in Asia‑Pacific, and ARPU was flat in Rest of World. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.57Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family MetricsThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as MAP or DAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products. Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our ""Family"" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. DAP/MAP:77%78%78%78%78%79%79%79%79%Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 4% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in June 2020.Worldwide DAP increased 15% to 2.60 billion on average during December 2020 from 2.26 billion during December 2019. 58Table of Contents•Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors.

For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 50 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in June 2020.As of December 31, 2020, we had 3.30 billion MAP, an increase of 14% from 2.89 billion as of December 31, 2019. 59Table of Contents•Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the definition of MAP above. The share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material. ARPP:$6.52$5.66$6.20$6.33$7.38$6.03$6.10$6.76$8.62Our annual worldwide ARPP in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $27.51, an increase of 8% from 2019.60Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In response to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with collectibility assessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in future periods, depending on the duration or degree of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. Collectibility Assessment of RevenueUnder Topic 606, we recognize revenue using a five-step model. In step one, for a revenue contract to exist, it must be probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled to will be collected. In performing such collectibility assessment, we consider various facts and circumstances including future expectations about our customer's ability and intention to pay. Collectibility assessment uses a probable threshold which requires estimation based on several objective and subjective factors, such as probability of default, customer’s intention to pay, payment history, financial strength, geography, and industry sub-vertical risks. The collectibility assessment has become uncertain during the current economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment.Credit Losses of Accounts ReceivableOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost that an entity does not expect to collect over the asset's contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.For accounts receivable measured at amortized cost, we use aging analysis, probability of default methods and incorporate macroeconomic variables that are most relevant to evaluating and estimating the expected credit losses. These macroeconomic variables may vary by geography, customer-type, or industry sub-vertical. The contractual life of our trade accounts receivable is generally short-term; however, we may experience increasing credit loss risks from accounts receivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment.Gross vs. Net in Revenue RecognitionFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party publishers, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in 61Table of Contentsestablishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income.Valuation of Equity InvestmentsFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, determining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For equity investments, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, 62Table of Contentsand updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. The ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15—Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Valuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Estimated Useful Lives We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.The useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense.63Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenueAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Other revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and cost of consumer hardware devices sold. Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, share-based compensation, and facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products.Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures and professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of legal-related costs; salaries and benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; and professional services. Results of OperationsIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, please refer to Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.64Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202020192018Revenue$85,965 $70,697 $55,838 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue16,692 12,770 9,355 Research and development18,447 13,600 10,273 Marketing and sales11,591 9,876 7,846 General and administrative6,564 10,465 3,451 Total costs and expenses53,294 46,711 30,925 Income from operations32,671 23,986 24,913 Interest and other income, net509 826 448 Income before provision for income taxes33,180 24,812 25,361 Provision for income taxes4,034 6,327 3,249 Net income$29,146 $18,485 $22,112 The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue)(1):Year Ended December 31,202020192018Revenue100 %100 %100 %Costs and expenses:Cost of revenue19 18 17 Research and development21 19 18 Marketing and sales13 14 14 General and administrative8 15 6 Total costs and expenses62 66 55 Income from operations38 34 45 Interest and other income, net1 1 1 Income before provision for income taxes39 35 45 Provision for income taxes5 9 6 Net income34 %26 %40 %_________________________(1)Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (in millions):Year Ended December 31, 202020192018Cost of revenue$447 $377 $284 Research and development4,918 3,488 3,022 Marketing and sales691 569 511 General and administrative480 402 335 Total share-based compensation expense$6,536 $4,836 $4,152 65Table of ContentsShare-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue)(1): Year Ended December 31, 202020192018Cost of revenue1 %1 %1 %Research and development6 5 5 Marketing and sales1 1 1 General and administrative1 1 1 Total share-based compensation expense8 %7 %7 %_________________________(1)Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.Revenue Year Ended December 31,2020 vs 2019 % Change2019 vs 2018 % Change 202020192018 (in millions) Advertising$84,169 $69,655 $55,013 21 %27 %Other revenue1,796 1,042 825 72 %26 %Total revenue$85,965 $70,697 $55,838 22 %27 % 2020 Compared to 2019. Revenue in 2020 increased $15.27 billion, or 22%, compared to 2019. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue as a result of an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad.In 2020, the number of ads delivered increased by 34%, as compared with approximately 33% in 2019. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products, and an increase in users. In 2020, the average price per ad decreased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of approximately 5% in 2019. The decrease in average price per ad during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in advertising demand globally during the first two quarters of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, by an increasing proportion of the number of ads delivered as Stories ads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates. In the near-term, we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined primarily by several factors: the extent to which we continue to see increasing advertising demand in connection with the shift of commerce from offline to online, as well as increased consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; the status of the economic recovery from the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the magnitude of fiscal stimulus; and the extent to which changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers result in limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools.Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 28%, 19%, and 23% between the third and fourth quarters of 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 declined 16% and 10% compared to the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2020 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and 66Table of Contentsadvertising revenue would have been $86.08 billion and $84.30 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $120 million and $129 million, respectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020. Using the same constant rates, full year 2020 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $15.39 billion and $14.64 billion, respectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2019.Cost of revenue Year Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 % Change2019 vs 2018 % Change(dollars in millions)Cost of revenue$16,692 $12,770 $9,355 31 %37%Percentage of revenue19%18%17%2020 Compared to 2019. Cost of revenue in 2020 increased $3.92 billion, or 31%, compared to 2019. The increase was mostly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, higher cost associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and content costs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in cost of consumer hardware devices sold. In 2021, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with partner arrangements and consumer hardware devices.Research and developmentYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 % Change2019 vs 2018 % Change(dollars in millions)Research and development$18,447 $13,600 $10,273 36 %32 %Percentage of revenue21%19%18% 2020 Compared to 2019. Research and development expenses in 2020 increased $4.85 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 40% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in engineering and other technical functions supporting our continued investment in our Family of products and consumer hardware products.In 2021, we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees, and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives.Marketing and salesYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 % Change2019 vs 2018 % Change(dollars in millions)Marketing and sales$11,591 $9,876 $7,846 17 %26%Percentage of revenue13%14%14%2020 Compared to 2019. Marketing and sales expenses in 2020 increased $1.72 billion, or 17%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increases in marketing expenses and payroll and benefits expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in travel-related expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our payroll and benefits expenses increased as a result of a 16% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in our marketing and sales functions.67Table of ContentsIn 2021, we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and partnership efforts, and we anticipate marketing expenses will increase.General and administrativeYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 % Change2019 vs 2018 % Change(dollars in millions)Legal accrual related to FTC settlement$— $5,000 $— NMNMOther general and administrative6,564 5,465 3,451 20 %58 %General and administrative$6,564 $10,465 $3,451 (37)%203 %Percentage of revenue8%15%6% 2020 Compared to 2019. Excluding the $5.0 billion FTC settlement accrual recorded in 2019, general and administrative expenses in 2020 increased $1.10 billion, or 20%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher professional services costs and an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 23% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in our general and administrative functions.In 2021, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth.Interest and other income, netYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 % Change2019 vs 2018 % Change(in millions)Interest income, net$672 $904 $652 (26)%39 %Foreign currency exchange losses, net(129)(105)(213)(23)%51 %Other income (expense), net(34)27 9 NMNMInterest and other income, net$509 $826 $448 (38)%84 % 2020 Compared to 2019. Interest and other income, net in 2020 decreased $317 million compared to 2019. The majority of the decrease was due to a decrease in interest income related to lower interest rates compared to 2019.Provision for income taxesYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 % Change2019 vs 2018 % Change(dollars in millions)Provision for income taxes$4,034 $6,327 $3,249 (36)%95 %Effective tax rate12.2%25.5%12.8%2020 Compared to 2019. Our provision for income taxes in 2020 decreased $2.29 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019, mostly due to the additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for U.S. income tax purposes, both discussed below. Our effective tax rate in 2020 decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to the 2019 legal accrual related to the FTC settlement that was not tax-deductible, the additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for U.S. income tax purposes.In the third quarter of 2020, as part of finalizing our U.S. income tax return, we elected to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we recorded a total of $1.07 billion 68Table of Contentsincome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The income tax benefit resulted from recording a deferred income tax asset that was greater than the current income tax liability due to different tax rates applicable for the periods in which capitalized expenses will be amortized versus the period in which the increased current tax liability was accrued. We do not believe this election will materially affect our effective tax rate trend in the future. On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissioner to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion (Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion) that reversed the Tax Court Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July 22, 2019, the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer requested a hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States and the request was denied on June 22, 2020. Since we started to accrue income tax for share-based compensation cost-sharing expense in the second quarter of 2019, the denial of the request by the Supreme Court did not have a material impact to our financial results in 2020.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 22, 2021 price, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2021 will be in the high-teens.Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2020, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $3.48 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months. In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS filed its Pretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first sessions of the trial began in February 2020, and additional sessions are expected to continue in 2021. The IRS did not provide any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately $680 million 69Table of Contentsin excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2020, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.70Table of ContentsQuarterly Results of Operations DataThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2020.

Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $61.95 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of $7.10 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase was mostly due to $38.75 billion of cash generated from operations, offset by $15.72 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $6.36 billion for purchases of equity investments, $6.27 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $3.56 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock units (RSU) awards.Cash paid for income taxes was $4.23 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $10.62 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was $424 million. We anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and credits within the next three years. Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $4.90 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 27 million shares of our Class A common stock for $6.30 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $8.60 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2021, an additional $25 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.As of December 31, 2020, $7.18 billion of the $61.95 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the inquiry of the FTC into our platform and user data practices, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. We paid the penalty of $5.0 billion in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. On April 21, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to invest in Jio Platforms Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. The transaction closed on July 7, 2020, and we paid approximately $5.8 billion at the then-current exchange rate.We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash flow from operating activities during 2020 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including $6.86 billion of depreciation and amortization and $6.54 billion of share-based compensation expense, and offset by a cash payment of $5.0 billion for the FTC legal settlement. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly due to higher net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and 73Table of Contentsamortization, share-based compensation expense and deferred income tax, partially offset by the payment of $5.0 billion for the FTC legal settlement.Cash flow from operating activities during 2019 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including $5.74 billion of depreciation and amortization and $4.84 billion of share-based compensation expense. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher net income prior to the effect of the $5.0 billion FTC legal settlement accrual, an increase in taxes payable as well as increases in the non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expense.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during 2020 mostly resulted from $15.11 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure, $8.16 billion of net purchases of marketable securities, and $6.36 billion of purchases of equity investments. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in purchases of equity investments and in net purchases of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities during 2019 mostly resulted from $15.10 billion of net purchase of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and $4.19 billion of net purchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to increases in the net purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $21 billion to $23 billion in 2021.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2020 mostly consisted of $6.27 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $3.56 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in repurchases of our Class A common stock and in taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.Cash used in financing activities during 2019 mostly consisted of $4.20 billion used to settle repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $2.34 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $552 million of principal payments on finance leases. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.74Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments. Our obligations under operating leases include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, land, colocations, and equipment. Our other contractual commitments are mostly related to our investments in network infrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs, and data center operations. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2020:Payment Due by Period Total20212022-20232024-2025Thereafter(in millions)Operating lease obligations, including imputed interest(1)$20,751 $1,316 $3,017 $3,065 $13,353 Finance lease obligations, including imputed interest(1)1,088 249 214 100 525 Transition tax payable1,543 — 300 1,243 — Other contractual commitments7,504 4,213 1,071 244 1,976 Total contractual obligations$30,886 $5,778 $4,602 $4,652 $15,854 _________________________(1)Includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.Additionally, as part of the normal course of the business, we may also enter into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $4.94 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.Our other liabilities also include $3.48 billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15—Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.75Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity investment risk, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency losses of $129 million, $105 million, and $213 million were recognized in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $794 million and $525 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.Equity Investment RiskOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings. We continually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies. Our equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable market values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including recent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could result in a material impairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method were immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Our equity investments had a carrying value of $6.23 billion as of December 31, 2020.For additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 — Equity Investments, and Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, and ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part II, Item 7, ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.76Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:18:30.932075
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2022,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue."" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2021 using 2020 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled ""—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.""These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2021 Results Our key community metrics and financial results for 2021 are as follows:Family of Apps metrics:•Family daily active people (DAP) was 2.82 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 8% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.59 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 9% year-over-year.•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.93 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 5% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.91 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 4% year-over-year.•Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 10% year-over-year in 2021, and the average price per ad increased by 24% year-over-year in 2021.50Table of ContentsConsolidated and segment results:Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.In 2021, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world.Our advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 was adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the iOS operating system. We expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by these and other limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers. Our business and results of operations have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative measures implemented by authorities from time to time to help limit the spread of the illness, which have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen these pandemic-related trends subside, particularly in certain developed markets. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and these trends may continue to be subject to volatility.The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a varied impact on the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period. While we experienced a reduction in demand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic, we believe the pandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, particularly during the second half of 2020, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend. More recently, we believe this growth has moderated in many regions, which to some extent adversely affected our advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021. We may experience reduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the extent this trend continues, which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. However, the impact of the 51Table of Contentspandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of our advertising services, as well as on our overall results of operations, remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future.User growth and engagement were also impacted by a number of other factors in the second half of 2021. For example, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, and in response to competitive pressures, we have introduced new features such as Reels, which is growing in usage but is not currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. We also saw a deceleration in our community growth rates as the size of our community continued to increase. In addition, we experienced year-over-year declines in ad impressions delivered in the United States & Canada region. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue growth in the foreseeable future. Other global and regional business and macroeconomic conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue growth.We anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, including in our Reality Labs initiatives, will continue to drive expense growth in 2022. We expect 2022 capital expenditures to be in the range of $29-34 billion and total expenses to be in the range of $90-95 billion. In 2022, we also expect that our year-over-year total expense growth rates may significantly exceed our year-over-year revenue growth rates, which would adversely affect our operating margin and profitability.52Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family MetricsThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products. Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our ""Family"" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. DAP/MAP:78%79%79%79%79%79%79%78%79%Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in June 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 60 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in March 2021.Worldwide DAP increased 8% to 2.82 billion on average during December 2021 from 2.60 billion during December 2020. 53Table of Contents•Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors.

In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 50 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in June 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 70 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in March 2021.As of December 31, 2021, we had 3.59 billion MAP, an increase of 9% from 3.30 billion as of December 31, 2020. 54Table of Contents•Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the definition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material. ARPP:$7.38 $6.03 $6.10 $6.76 $8.62 $7.75 $8.36 $8.18 $9.39 Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.Our annual worldwide ARPP in 2021, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $33.68, an increase of 22% from 2020.55Table of ContentsTrends in Our Facebook User MetricsThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.

Users in India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam represented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December 2021, relative to the same period in 2020.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook. As of December 31, 2021, we had 2.91 billion MAUs, an increase of 4% from December 31, 2020. Users in India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in 2021, relative to the same period in 2020.57Table of ContentsTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See ""Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)"" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2021 in the United States & Canada region was more than 12 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.ARPU:$8.52 $6.95 $7.05 $7.89 $10.14 $9.27 $10.12 $10.00 $11.57 ARPU:$41.41 $34.18 $36.49 $39.63 $53.56 $48.03 $53.01 $52.34 $60.57 ARPU:$13.21$10.64$11.03$12.41$16.87$15.49$17.23$16.50 $19.68 ARPU:$3.57$3.06$2.99$3.67$4.05$3.94$4.16$4.30$4.89ARPU:$2.48$1.99$1.78$2.22$2.77$2.64$3.05$3.14$3.43 Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.58Table of Contents Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplemental Data"" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers. Our annual worldwide ARPU in 2021, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $40.96, an increase of 28% from 2020. For 2021, ARPU increased by 40% in Rest of World, 35% in Europe, 31% in the United States & Canada, and 26% in Asia‑Pacific, as compared with 2020. In addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.59Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Gross vs. Net in Revenue RecognitionFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income. Valuation of Equity InvestmentsFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, determining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For equity investments, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate 60Table of Contentsarms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters. The ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Valuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated Useful Lives We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based 61Table of Contentsupon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.The useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. In connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the estimated average useful lives of our server and network assets category. The effect of the 2021 change was a reduction in depreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of $516 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of the effective dates of the changes and applying the revised useful lives prospectively. See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment.62Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenue Family of Apps (FoA)Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. We calculate price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis. Other revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.Reality Labs (RL)RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, Facebook Portal, and wearables, and related software and content.Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL cost of products sold; and content costs. Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, and professional services. Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional expenses and payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal-related costs, which include accruals for estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legal fees; payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes, other tax levies, and gross receipts taxes; and professional services. 63Table of ContentsResults of OperationsIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202120202019Revenue$117,929 $85,965 $70,697 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue22,649 16,692 12,770 Research and development24,655 18,447 13,600 Marketing and sales14,043 11,591 9,876 General and administrative9,829 6,564 10,465 Total costs and expenses71,176 53,294 46,711 Income from operations46,753 32,671 23,986 Interest and other income, net531 509 826 Income before provision for income taxes47,284 33,180 24,812 Provision for income taxes7,914 4,034 6,327 Net income$39,370 $29,146 $18,485 The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue)(1):Year Ended December 31,202120202019Revenue100 %100 %100 %Costs and expenses:Cost of revenue19 19 18 Research and development21 21 19 Marketing and sales12 13 14 General and administrative8 8 15 Total costs and expenses60 62 66 Income from operations40 38 34 Interest and other income, net— 1 1 Income before provision for income taxes40 39 35 Provision for income taxes7 5 9 Net income33 %34 %26 %_________________________(1)Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.64Table of ContentsShare-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (in millions):Year Ended December 31, 202120202019Cost of revenue$577 $447 $377 Research and development7,106 4,918 3,488 Marketing and sales837 691 569 General and administrative644 480 402 Total share-based compensation expense$9,164 $6,536 $4,836 Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue)(1): Year Ended December 31, 202120202019Cost of revenue— %1 %1 %Research and development6 6 5 Marketing and sales1 1 1 General and administrative1 1 1 Total share-based compensation expense8 %8 %7 %_________________________(1)Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.RevenueThe following table sets forth our revenue by segment.

The increase was mostly driven by an increase in advertising revenue.AdvertisingAdvertising revenue in 2021 increased $30.76 billion, or 37%, compared to 2020 as a result of increases in both the average price per ad and the number of ads delivered. In 2021, the average price per ad increased by 24%, as compared with a decrease of approximately 10% in 2020. The increase in average price per ad in 2021 was mainly caused by a recovery from declines in advertising demand in the first two quarters of 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, overall advertising demand increased, as compared to 2020, across our ad products and in all regions in part due to the continued growth of online commerce. In 2021, the number of ads delivered increased by 10%, as compared with an approximate 34% increase in 2020. The increase in the ads delivered in 2021 was driven by increases in users and the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products. We anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered. 65Table of ContentsReality LabsRL revenue increased $1.14 billion, or 100%, from 2020 to 2021, and $638 million, or 127%, from 2019 to 2020. The increases in both periods were mostly driven by increases in the volume of our consumer hardware products sold.Revenue Seasonality and Customer ConcentrationRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 16%, 31%, and 19% between the third and fourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019 declined 7%, 16%, and 11% compared to the fourth quarters of 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We note the decline in total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was exacerbated by the non-seasonal impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue The general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 had a favorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2021 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $116.29 billion and $113.31 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $1.64 billion and $1.62 billion lower than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2021. Using the same constant rates, full year 2021 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $30.32 billion and $29.15 billion, respectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020.Cost of revenueYear Ended December 31,2021202020192021 vs 2020 % Change2020 vs 2019 % Change(dollars in millions)Cost of revenue$22,649 $16,692 $12,770 36 %31%Percentage of revenue19%19%18%Cost of revenue in 2021 increased $5.96 billion, or 36%, compared to 2020. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in Reality Labs cost of products sold and an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease in the depreciation growth rate mostly due to increases in the useful lives of servers and network assets. To a lesser extent, costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition and payment processing costs, also increased.See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.In 2022, we anticipate that cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth and engagement and the delivery of new products and services, and, to a lesser extent, due to higher content costs.66Table of ContentsResearch and developmentYear Ended December 31,2021202020192021 vs 2020 % Change2020 vs 2019 % Change(dollars in millions)Research and development$24,655 $18,447 $13,600 34 %36 %Percentage of revenue21%21%19% Research and development expenses in 2021 increased $6.21 billion, or 34%, compared to 2020.

As a result, we recorded a total of $1.07 billion income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020. Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 28, 2022 price, and absent U.S. tax legislation changes and other one-time events, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2022 to be similar to the effective tax rate for the full year 2021. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses starting in 2022, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax liabilities but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization requirement is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2022 could be a few percentage points higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower.Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.See Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.69Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $48.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $13.96 billion from December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to $44.54 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $19.24 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, and $5.51 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock units (RSU) awards, offset by $57.68 billion of cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.Cash paid for income taxes was $8.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $10.61 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was $527 million. We anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and credits within the next two years. Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 136 million shares of our Class A common stock for $44.81 billion. As of December 31, 2021, $38.79 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. As of December 31, 2021, $10.61 billion of the $48.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities$57,683 $38,747 $36,314 Net cash used in investing activities$(7,570)$(30,059)$(19,864)Net cash used in financing activities$(50,728)$(10,292)$(7,299)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $39.37 billion net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including $9.16 billion of share-based compensation expense and $7.97 billion of depreciation and amortization. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense and deferred income taxes, partially offset by changes in working capital.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during 2021 primarily consisted of $18.57 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure offset by $12.18 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to decreases in net purchases of marketable securities and equity investments, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $29 billion to $34 billion in 2022.70Table of ContentsCash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $44.54 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $5.51 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to the increase in repurchases of our Class A common stock.Free Cash Flow In addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as a non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.We believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business. We have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior management and board of directors.FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:•FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and•other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.Management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.The following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities$57,683 $38,747 $36,314 Less: Purchases of property and equipment(18,567)(15,115)(15,102)Less: Principal payments on finance leases(677)(604)(552)Free cash flow$38,439 $23,028 $20,660 Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.71Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments. Our operating lease obligations mostly include among others, certain of our offices, data centers, colocations and land. Our other contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers, network infrastructure and Reality Labs. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):Payment Due by Period Total20222023-20242025-2026ThereafterOperating lease obligations, including imputed interest(1)$25,410 $1,559 $3,966 $3,837 $16,048 Finance lease obligations, including imputed interest(1)2,303 678 603 322 700 Transition tax payable1,537 — 848 689 — Other contractual commitments23,080 14,502 5,426 609 2,543 Total contractual obligations$52,330 $16,739 $10,843 $5,457 $19,291 _________________________(1)Includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.Additionally, as part of the normal course of business, we may also enter into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $8.06 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.Our other liabilities also include $4.40 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.72Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risk.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency losses of $140 million, $129 million, and $105 million were recognized in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, as interest and other income, net in our consolidated statements of income. Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $714 million and $794 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.Equity Investment RiskOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings. We continually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies. Our equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets, including recent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could result in a material impairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method were immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Our total equity investments had a carrying value of $6.78 billion and $6.23 billion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.For additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 — Equity Investments, and Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part II, Item 7, ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.73Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:18:33.929471
1326801,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.",2023,"Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors."" For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled ""—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue."" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2022 using 2021 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full description of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled ""—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.""These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2022 Results Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. In 2022, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued to invest in both our family of apps and our metaverse efforts based on our company priorities. Our financial results and key community metrics for 2022 are set forth below. Our total revenue for 2022 was $116.61 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to 2021, which reflects a $5.96 billion negative impact from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. Revenue on a constant currency basis was $122.57 billion for 2022, an increase of 4% compared to 2021. Our advertising revenue was impacted by a reduction in advertising demand during 2022 compared to 2021, which we believe was primarily driven by reduced marketer spending as a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment, as well as limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment. Our average price per ad decreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022, partially offset by an 18% year-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps.Income from operations for 2022 was $28.94 billion, a decrease of $17.81 billion, or 38%, compared to 2021, mainly due to an increase in payroll and related expenses associated with a 20% increase in employee headcount particularly in engineering and other technical functions and higher operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure. Starting in the third quarter of 2022, we began a series of cost management initiatives including facilities consolidation, a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees, and a pivot in our data center strategy, which resulted in total restructuring charges of $4.61 billion in 2022. We expect we may incur significant additional restructuring charges as we continue to focus on cost efficiency measures through 2023. 54Table of ContentsConsolidated and Segment ResultsWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services.

Our reported headcount includes a substantial majority of the approximately 11,000 employees impacted by the layoff we announced in November 2022, who will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the first quarter of 2023.RestructuringIn 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. This includes a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 of our employees across the FoA and RL segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects.A summary of our restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):Facilities ConsolidationSeverance and Other Personnel CostsData Center AssetsTotalCost of revenue$154 $— $1,341 $1,495 Research and development1,311 408 — 1,719 Marketing and sales404 234 — 638 General and administrative426 333 — 759 Total$2,295 $975 $1,341 $4,611 Total restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $4.10 billion and RL segment were $515 million. These charges lowered our operating margin by four percentage points and diluted earnings per share (EPS) by $1.34. The impact of severance and other personnel costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 was not material after offsetting with the savings from the decreases in payroll, bonus and other benefits expenses.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding restructuring charges.55Table of ContentsFamily of Apps Metrics•Family daily active people (DAP) was 2.96 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 5% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.74 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-year.•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.00 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.96 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 2% year-over-year.•Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 18% year-over-year in 2022, and the average price per ad decreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022.Developments in AdvertisingSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.In particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, ePrivacy Directive, and California Privacy Rights Act have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we expect these and other developments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.To mitigate these developments, we are working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the regulatory and platform developments described above will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.Other Business and Macroeconomic ConditionsOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services. In response to competitive pressures, we have introduced new features such as Reels and are investing in our artificial intelligence-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it is not currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which adversely affected user growth and engagement in 2022. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in 2022, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.56Table of ContentsThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted our business and results of operations, with a varied impact on user growth and engagement, as well as the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period. While we experienced a reduction in advertising demand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic, we believe the pandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend. More recently, we believe this growth has declined, and we saw continued softening of advertising demand in 2022 as many activities that shifted online during COVID-19 related lockdowns resumed in person. We may experience similar volatility in the demand for and pricing of our advertising services as a result of the pandemic in the future.Although we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented.Investment PhilosophyIn 2022, we continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world.We anticipate that investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and headcount will continue to drive expense growth in 2023, which will adversely affect our operating margin and profitability. The majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2022, 82% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 18% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the metaverse that are not on the market today and may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.57Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family MetricsThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products. Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our ""Family"" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. DAP/MAP:79%79%79%78%79%79%79%79%79%Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 60 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in March 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022.Worldwide DAP increased 5% to 2.96 billion on average during December 2022 from 2.82 billion during December 2021. 58Table of Contents•Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view MAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors.

In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 70 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in March 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in September 2022.As of December 31, 2022, we had 3.74 billion MAP, an increase of 4% from 3.59 billion as of December 31, 2021. 59Table of Contents•Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users of our Family products as described in the definition of MAP above. We estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also MAP was not material. ARPP:$8.62$7.75$8.36$8.18$9.39$7.72$7.91$7.53$8.63 Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.Our annual worldwide ARPP in 2022, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPP during such period, was $31.79, a decrease of 6% from 2021.60Table of ContentsTrends in Our Facebook User MetricsThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or our other products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (as defined below) access Facebook on mobile devices. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.

Users in India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December 2022, relative to the same period in 2021.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook. As of December 31, 2022, we had 2.96 billion MAUs, an increase of 2% from December 31, 2021. Users in India, Nigeria, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in 2022, relative to the same period in 2021.62Table of ContentsTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See ""Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)"" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2022 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.ARPU:$10.14 $9.27 $10.12 $10.00$11.57$9.54$9.82$9.41$10.86 ARPU:$53.56 $48.03 $53.01 $52.34 $60.57 $48.29$50.25$49.13$58.77ARPU:$16.87$15.49$17.23$16.50$19.68$15.35$15.64$14.23$17.29 ARPU:$4.05$3.94$4.16$4.30$4.89$4.47$4.54$4.42$4.61ARPU:$2.77$2.64$3.05$3.14$3.43$3.14$3.35$3.21$3.52 Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.63Table of Contents Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplemental Data"" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers. Our annual worldwide ARPU in 2022, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $39.63, a decrease of 3% from 2021. For 2022, ARPU decreased by 9% in Europe and 4% in United States & Canada, and increased by 4% in Asia-Pacific and 8% in Rest of World. In addition, user growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may decrease at a higher rate, or increase at a slower rate, relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.64Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation of non-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Gross vs. Net in Revenue RecognitionFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income. Valuation of Non-marketable Equity SecuritiesFor our non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, determining whether a non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For non-marketable equity securities, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate 65Table of Contentsarms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters. The ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 16 — Income Taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Valuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated Useful Lives We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade 66Table of Contentsnames from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.The useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised remaining useful life. In connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the estimated average useful lives of our servers and network assets category effective the second and the fourth quarters of 2022. The financial impact of the changes in estimates was a reduction in depreciation expense of $860 million and an increase in net income of $693 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2022. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the servers and network assets existing as of the effective date of the change and applying the revised useful lives prospectively. See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.67Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenue Family of Apps (FoA)Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. In particular, the number of ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are not currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part of our product and monetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the average price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis. Other revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform and various other sources.Reality Labs (RL)RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content.Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions, and content costs. Additionally, cost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments. Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improving existing products, RL technology development costs, and professional services. Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mostly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legal fees; professional services, and other taxes, such as digital services taxes, other tax levies.68Table of ContentsResults of OperationsIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, please refer to Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202220212020Revenue$116,609 $117,929 $85,965 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue25,249 22,649 16,692 Research and development35,338 24,655 18,447 Marketing and sales15,262 14,043 11,591 General and administrative11,816 9,829 6,564 Total costs and expenses87,665 71,176 53,294 Income from operations28,944 46,753 32,671 Interest and other income (expense), net(125)531 509 Income before provision for income taxes28,819 47,284 33,180 Provision for income taxes5,619 7,914 4,034 Net income$23,200 $39,370 $29,146 The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue)(1):Year Ended December 31,202220212020Revenue100 %100 %100 %Costs and expenses:Cost of revenue22 19 19 Research and development30 21 21 Marketing and sales13 12 13 General and administrative10 8 8 Total costs and expenses75 60 62 Income from operations25 40 38 Interest and other income (expense), net— — 1 Income before provision for income taxes25 40 39 Provision for income taxes5 7 5 Net income20 %33 %34 %_________________________(1)Percentages have been rounded for presentation purposes and may differ from unrounded results.69Table of ContentsRevenueThe following table sets forth our revenue by source and by segment.

The decrease was mostly driven by advertising revenue.AdvertisingAdvertising revenue in 2022 decreased $1.29 billion, or 1%, compared to 2021 due to a decrease in the average price per ad, partially offset by an increase in the number of ads delivered. In 2022, the average price per ad decreased by 16%, as compared with an increase of 24% in 2021. The decrease in average price per ad was driven by an increase in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products such as video and Reels that monetize at lower rates, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In addition, the decrease in average price per ad was impacted by a reduction in advertising demand, which we believe was primarily driven by reduced marketer spending as a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment and limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment, as well as, to a lesser extent, the other factors discussed in the section entitled ""—Executive Overview of Full Year 2022 Results."" In 2022, the number of ads delivered increased by 18%, as compared with a 10% increase in 2021. Ads impressions grew in all regions during 2022, mostly driven by an increase in ads delivered in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. The increase in the ads delivered during 2022 was driven by increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.Reality LabsRL revenue in 2022 decreased $115 million, or 5%, compared to 2021. The decrease in RL revenue was driven by a decrease in the volume of Meta Quest sales.Revenue Seasonality and Customer ConcentrationRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 16%, 16%, and 31% between the third and fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020 declined 17%, 7%, and 16% compared to the fourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 had an unfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2022 using the prior 70Table of Contentsyear's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $122.57 billion and $119.54 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $5.96 billion and $5.90 billion higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2022. Using the same constant rates, full year 2022 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $4.64 billion and $4.60 billion, respectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2021.Cost of revenueYear Ended December 31,2022202120202022 vs 2021 % change2021 vs 2020 % change(in millions, except percentages)Cost of revenue$25,249 $22,649 $16,692 11 %36 %Percentage of revenue22 %19 %19 %Cost of revenue in 2022 increased $2.60 billion, or 11%, compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, adjusted for a decrease in the depreciation growth rate due to extensions in the useful lives of servers and network assets. In addition, we recorded $1.34 billion of abandonment charges related to data center assets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in RL inventory cost including lower losses on purchase commitments.See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful life of our servers and network assets as well as the abandonment charges related to data center assets, respectively.Research and developmentYear Ended December 31,2022202120202022 vs 2021 % change2021 vs 2020 % change(in millions, except percentages)Research and development$35,338 $24,655 $18,447 43 %34 %Percentage of revenue30 %21 %21 %Research and development expenses in 2022 increased $10.68 billion, or 43%, compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to higher payroll and related expenses and $1.31 billion impairment charges to leases and leasehold improvements as part of our restructuring efforts. Our payroll and related expenses increased as a result of a 26% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 in engineering and other technical functions supporting our continued investment in our family of products and RL.Marketing and salesYear Ended December 31,2022202120202022 vs 2021 % change2021 vs 2020 % change(in millions, except percentages)Marketing and sales$15,262 $14,043 $11,591 9 %21 %Percentage of revenue13 %12 %13 %Marketing and sales expenses in 2022 increased $1.22 billion, or 9%, compared to 2021.

Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock price remains constant to the January 27, 2023 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2023 to be in the low twenties. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2022, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2022 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization requirement is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2023 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower.Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods.On August 16, 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The key tax provisions applicable to us are a 15% corporate minimum tax on book income and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases effective January 1, 2023. We do 73Table of Contentsnot expect these tax law changes to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position; however, we will continue to evaluate their impact as further information becomes available.Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2022, we had net uncertain tax positions of $5.49 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties regarding the utilization of our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months.See Note 16 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.74Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $40.74 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $7.26 billion from December 31, 2021. The majority of the decrease was due to $32.04 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $27.96 billion repurchases of our Class A common stock, $3.60 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, and $1.31 billion for acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets. These decreases were partially offset by $50.48 billion of cash generated from operations and $9.92 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior notes (the ""Notes"") in August 2022. Cash paid for income taxes was $6.41 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $196 million and our federal tax credit carryforward was $276 million. We anticipate the utilization of most of these net operating losses and credits within the next two years. Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. In 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 161 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $27.93 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $10.87 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2023, an additional $40 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202220212020Net cash provided by operating activities$50,475 $57,683 $38,747 Net cash used in investing activities$(28,970)$(7,570)$(30,059)Net cash used in financing activities$(22,136)$(50,728)$(10,292)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities during 2022 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $11.99 billion of share-based compensation expense, $8.69 billion of depreciation and amortization, and $3.56 billion of impairment for leases, leasehold improvements, and abandonment charges for data center assets related to our restructuring efforts. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mainly due to a decrease in net income as adjusted for the aforementioned non-cash items, partially offset by changes in working capital.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $31.19 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $3.53 billion proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mostly due to an increase in net purchases of property and equipment, and a decrease in proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30 billion to $33 billion in 2023.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $27.96 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $3.60 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $9.92 billion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock and proceeds from the issuance of the Notes.75Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow In addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as a non-GAAP measure to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.We believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business. We have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior management and board of directors.FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations of FCF are:•FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and•other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.Management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities, as presented below.The following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202220212020Net cash provided by operating activities$50,475 $57,683 $38,747 Purchases of property and equipment, net(31,186)(18,567)(15,115)Principal payments on finance leases(850)(677)(604)Free Cash Flow$18,439 $38,439 $23,028 Material Cash RequirementsWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.Leases and Contractual CommitmentsOur operating lease obligations mostly include, among others, offices, data centers, colocations, and land. Our finance lease obligations mostly include certain network infrastructure. Our restructuring efforts to sublease, early terminate or abandon several office buildings under operating leases did not materially change our operating lease obligations. Our contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in network infrastructure, servers, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs. 76Table of ContentsLong-term DebtIn August 2022, we issued an aggregate of $10.0 billion principal amount of the Notes. The Notes were issued in four series, which mature from 2027 through 2062. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of December 31, 2022 are $411 million and $7.69 billion, respectively. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments.TaxesAs of December 31, 2022, we had taxes payable of $1.51 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, of which $361 million is due within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. Our other liabilities also include $5.49 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 9 — Leases, Note 11 — Long-term Debt, Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 16 — Income Taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, and ""Legal Proceedings"" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding leases and contractual commitments, long-term debt, taxes, and contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.77Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity price risk.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of $81 million, $140 million, and $129 million were recognized in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and the fair value of our long-term debt.Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $558 million and $714 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.As of December 31, 2022, we also had $10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes (the ""Notes"") outstanding. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates. Equity Price RiskOur equity investments are substantially all in non-marketable equity securities and are subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings.Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account for most of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the valuation of these companies we invest in and, therefore, result in a material impairment or downward adjustment in our investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $6.20 billion and $6.78 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 78Table of ContentsFor additional information, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities, Note 7 — Fair Value Measurements, and Note 11 — Long-term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" and Part II, Item 7, ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 79Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:18:34.288793
