For some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements, see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 8.OverviewVision DuPont's vision is to be the world's most dynamic science company, creating sustainable solutions essential to a better, safer and healthier life for people everywhere. The company is committed to growing shareholder and societal value while reducing its environmental footprint in the value chains in which it operates, over the long-term.Strategy The company's strategy for growth is to apply its science and technology to address three challenges driven by global population growth: feeding the world, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and keeping people and the environment safe. Critical areas for the company's growth are innovation, differential management and productivity. Applying science to deliver innovative solutions and new products in the marketplace generates shareholder value and profitable growth. Differential management is a disciplined process to prioritize and allocate resources across businesses and geographies aligned with growth opportunities. The company continues to achieve fixed cost, working capital and variable cost productivity through disciplined business processes called DuPont Integrated Business Management (DIBM) and DuPont Production System (DPS). DIBM focuses on the business supply chain to maximize efficiency and optimize working capital, while DPS focuses on productivity outcomes to eliminate operational inefficiencies and improve lead time, cycle time and quality. Goals The company's long-term plan includes compound annual growth targets of 7 percent for sales and 12 percent for earnings per share. In 2011, sales were up 20 percent with strong contributions across most segments with earnings per share increasing 12 percent. Sales in developing markets, which include China, India, and the countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, are targeted to make up 40 percent of the company's sales by 2015, a 6 percentage point increase from 2011. In 2011, sales of new products introduced in the last four years were in line with the company's long-term target of 30 percent of total sales. Additionally, the company exceeded its 2011 goals for fixed cost and working capital productivity. The company remains on-track to exceed its three-year 2010-2012 plan of $1 billion fixed cost productivity actions and has already exceeded its three-year 2010-2012 plan of $1 billion working capital productivity. The company is committed to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth.16Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of OperationsAcquisition of Danisco In 2011, the company acquired Danisco in a transaction valued at $6.4 billion, plus net debt assumed of $0.6 billion. As part of this acquisition, DuPont incurred $85 million in transaction related costs during 2011, which were recorded in costs of goods sold and other operating charges. In 2011, the businesses acquired from Danisco contributed net sales of $1.7 billion and net income attributable to DuPont of $(7) million, which excludes $30 million after-tax ($39 million pre-tax) of additional interest expense related to the debt issued to finance the acquisition. Danisco's contributions included a $125 million after-tax ($175 million pre-tax) charge related to the fair value step-up of inventories acquired and sold during 2011.In 2011, the company initiated a series of actions to achieve the expected cost and revenue synergies associated with the Danisco acquisition. As part of these actions, the company incurred restructuring charges totaling $53 million. Additionally, the company expects to incur about $50 million of other costs to achieve synergies through 2013, including operating enhancements, consulting fees and relocation related costs, which will be expensed as incurred. These actions are expected to produce pre-tax annual cost savings of at least $130 million beginning in 2012, a full year ahead of the original schedule.

Local selling prices were significantly higher for titanium dioxide, seeds, fluoroproducts and electronic products, with the latter reflecting pass through pricing for higher precious metals costs. Worldwide sales volume increased 1 percent as strong volume growth in Agriculture was largely offset by declines in Electronic & Communications, Performance Chemicals and Performance Materials. The declines occurred primarily during the fourth quarter, resulting from destocking in photovoltaics, polymer and industrial supply chains, as well as weaker demand for company products supplying consumer electronics and construction. Volume growth in Latin America was driven by Agriculture, Safety & Protection and Performance Coatings. Sales in developing markets of $13.0 billion improved 27 percent from 2010, and the percentage of total company sales in these markets increased to 34 percent from 32 percent in 2010.17Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7.

Volume was higher across all segments, with the largest dollar increases in Performance Materials, Performance Chemicals, and Electronics & Communications. Volume grew double digits in all regions, led by a rebound in demand in the Asia Pacific region. Sales in developing markets of $10.2 billion improved 27 percent from 2009, and the percentage of total company sales in these markets increased to 32 percent from 31 percent in 2009.(Dollars in millions)201120102009OTHER INCOME, NET$758$1,228$1,2192011 versus 2010 The $470 million decrease was largely attributable to a $201 million reduction of Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income, an increase of $150 million in net pre-tax exchange losses, the absence of a benefit of $59 million recorded in 2010 related to accrued interest associated with settlements of income tax contingencies related to prior years, the absence of $41 million in insurance recoveries and a $37 million decrease in net gains on sales of assets. 2010 versus 2009 Other income, net, was essentially flat compared to 2009, despite a decrease of $549 million of Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income due to the expiration of certain patents. Offsetting the reduction of Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income was a decrease in net pre-tax exchange losses of $192 million combined with higher income from equity affiliates of $93 million, an increase in net gains on sales of assets of $64 million, a benefit of $59 million in 2010 related to accrued interest associated with settlements of income tax contingencies related to prior years, an increase in insurance recoveries of $41 million and a $31 million combined benefit from an acquisition and an early termination of a supply agreement.Additional information related to the company's other income, net is included in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(Dollars in millions)201120102009COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES$27,814$23,146$19,708As a percent of net sales73%73%75%2011 versus 2010 Cost of goods sold and other operating charges (COGS) increased 20 percent. COGS as a percentage of net sales was 73 percent, unchanged from prior year, as selling price increases of $3.6 billion were offset by $2.0 billion of inflation in raw material, energy and freight costs, and $0.7 billion of higher plant operating costs, including capacity expansions. 2011 COGS also included $175 million of additional costs related to the fair value step-up of inventory acquired from Danisco, $85 million of Danisco transaction related fees and $175 million for charges related to Imprelis® herbicide claims. 2010 versus 2009 COGS increased 17 percent, while COGS as a percent of net sales decreased 2 percentage points from 2009. The improvement principally reflects increased manufacturing utilization and higher selling prices that more than offset increases in raw material costs. Higher selling prices increased sales $1.3 billion, while raw material, energy and freight costs, adjusted for volume and currency, were up 6 percent, or $0.7 billion.18Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7.

Both periods include a $50 million charge for payments related to a Pioneer licensing agreement prior to the business receiving regulatory approval in the third quarter 2011.2010 versus 2009 The $273 million increase was due to continued growth investment aligned with the company's global trends, including resources to support agriculture productivity, alternative fuels and energy efficient materials, and safety and protection. In addition, research and development expense increased due to higher non-cash pension expenses and a $50 million charge for an upfront payment related to a Pioneer licensing agreement.(Dollars in millions)201120102009INTEREST EXPENSE$447$590$408The $143 million decrease in 2011 was due primarily to the absence of a $179 million pre-tax charge on the early extinguishment of debt and lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average debt resulting from financing for the Danisco acquisition. The $182 million increase in 2010 was primarily due to a $179 million pre-tax charge on the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter 2010. (Dollars in millions)201120102009EMPLOYEE SEPARATION/ASSET RELATED CHARGES, NET$50$(34)$2102011 versus 2010 The $84 million change in 2011 was due to a net $50 million restructuring charge in 2011, primarily related to restructuring charges associated with the Danisco acquisition and the absence of a $34 million net reduction in the estimated costs for prior years restructuring programs.2010 versus 2009 The $244 million change in 2010 was due to the absence of a net $210 million restructuring charge in 2009 and a $34 million net reduction in the estimated costs for prior years restructuring programs in 2010. The $34 million net reduction resulted from lower than estimated individual severance costs and work force reductions through non-severance programs.

These were partially offset by net tax benefits of $49 million related to the adjustment of income tax accruals associated with settlements of tax contingencies related to prior years and $39 million for reversal of tax valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. The decrease in the 2010 effective tax rate compared to 2009 was primarily due to favorable geographic mix of pre-tax earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions and the net tax benefits noted above.See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provision for income taxes, as well as items that significantly impact the company's effective income tax rate.(Dollars in millions)201120102009NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DUPONT$3,474$3,031$1,7552011 versus 2010 Net income attributable to DuPont (earnings) for 2011 increased $443 million, or 15 percent versus 2010. The increase in earnings principally reflects higher local selling prices, higher sales volume and currency benefits, partly offset by higher raw material, energy and freight costs, increased spending for growth initiatives, and lower Pharmaceuticals income. See additional information above related to changes in earnings.2010 versus 2009 Earnings for 2010 increased $1.3 billion, or 73 percent versus 2009. The increase principally reflects higher sales volume and selling prices and the absence of a prior year restructuring charge, partly offset by higher non-cash pension costs and lower Pharmaceuticals income. See additional information above related to changes in earnings.Corporate OutlookDuPont's full-year 2012 sales and earnings are expected to benefit from a strong agriculture economy, market-driven innovation and ongoing productivity, partially offset by headwinds created by a stronger dollar and a higher tax rate. The company expects higher operating costs including an increase in raw material, energy and freight costs, and plans to partly offset the impact of these increases with productivity programs for fixed costs reduction totaling $300 million.The company plans to continue a differential level of capital expenditures and funding for research and development for businesses expected to have above-average growth rates and margins. For 2012, targets have been set for capital expenditures totaling about 20Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7.

Products are transferred between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the market value of the products. Segment pre-tax operating income (loss) (PTOI) is defined as operating income before income taxes, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. All references to selling prices are on a U.S. dollar (USD) basis, including the impact of currency. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated net sales and segment PTOI to income before income taxes for 2011, 2010 and 2009 is included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.AGRICULTURE(Dollars in millions)201120102009Segment sales$9,166$7,845$7,069PTOI$1,527$1,293$1,160PTOI margin17%16%16% 20112010Change in segment sales from prior period due to: Selling price6%4 %Volume10%8 %Portfolio / Other1%(1)%Total change17%11 %2011 versus 2010 Pioneer seed sales reflect growth primarily in corn and soybean seeds. Volume increases in all regions were underpinned by increased acres and market position. Pricing gains in all regions reflect the introduction and penetration of new products including Optimum® AcreMax® 1 into the North America corn lineup. Crop Protection sales growth reflects both volume and price gains with increases in insect control, weed control and fungicides product sales, particularly continued strong demand for Rynaxypyr® insecticide and continued expansion of picoxystrobin fungicides. Sales grew in all regions, particularly Latin America and Europe. 2011 PTOI and PTOI margin increased on continued new product penetration and leverage on volume growth, partially offset by a $175 million charge related to Imprelis® claims. Additionally, aligned with the segment's long-term plan, research and development expense increased 15 percent to support continued growth in breeding, biotechnology and crop chemistry. 2011 and 2010 PTOI each included a licensing agreement charge of $50 million. 2010 versus 2009 Higher sales volume was primarily due to higher Pioneer seed sales in North America with market share gains for corn and soybeans. Higher global sales of Crop Protection products were led by broad-based recovery across most regions and strong demand for Rynaxypyr® in Asia Pacific and Latin America. The higher selling prices reflect higher value product mix and pricing actions to offset the increase in raw material costs, along with a favorable currency impact. 2010 PTOI increased primarily due to the higher sales volume, partially offset by higher spending for growth investments and a $50 million charge for an upfront payment associated with a Pioneer licensing agreement. PTOI margin was flat compared to 2009.Outlook Pioneer anticipates continued global growth in corn and soybean markets, as well as pricing gains reflecting innovative technology and the business' differentiated route to market. Specific innovations include continued penetration of the Optimum® AcreMaxTM 1 products in corn coupled with new corn hybrids, many of which include AquaMax® technology and new soybean varieties with leading disease packages developed for local needs. Pioneer anticipates earnings growth in 2012 reflecting strong sales performance, partially offset by higher input costs resulting from commodity price increases and the weather related impact 21Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7.

For Solae, higher selling prices and volume reflect strong demand for specialty soy products. 2011 PTOI and PTOI margin decreased as higher sales were more than offset by a $112 million charge for transaction related costs and the fair value step-up of inventories that were acquired and a $14 million restructuring charge. PTOI also included $49 million of amortization expense associated with the fair value step-up of the acquired intangible assets.2010 versus 2009 Higher sales volume was led by strong demand for Solae® soy products, particularly in Latin America. 2010 PTOI and PTOI margin were essentially flat compared to 2009 as unfavorable currency impact coupled with increased manufacturing costs offset volume growth. Outlook 2012 sales and earnings will reflect a full year of results from the specialty food ingredients business acquired from Danisco in 2011. Science-based innovation growth, cost synergies derived from integration, productivity gains and the absence of charges for transaction and integration related costs in 2011 are expected to contribute to earnings and margin expansion. Volume growth reflecting specialty soy product expansion is anticipated to support earnings and PTOI margin improvement.PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS(Dollars in millions)201120102009Segment sales$7,794$6,322$4,964PTOI$1,923$1,081$547PTOI margin25%17%11% 20112010Change in segment sales from prior period due to: Selling price26 %10 %Volume(3)%18 %Portfolio / Other— %(1)%Total change23 %27 %23Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2011 versus 2010 Sales increased across all regions and market segments. The increase in sales reflects favorable pricing for titanium dioxide and fluoropolymers, as well as pass-through pricing of higher raw material costs for fluorochemicals and industrial chemicals. 2011 PTOI and PTOI margin improved driven by the higher selling prices and fixed cost productivity. 2010 versus 2009 Broad-based market recovery led to sales increases in all markets and all regions, most significant in Asia Pacific, reflecting strong demand for titanium dioxide, fluoropolymers and refrigerants, with continuing adoption of ISCEON® as a preferred retrofit to R22 refrigerant. Higher selling prices reflect favorable pricing for titanium dioxide, fluorochemicals and fluoropolymers and pass-through of higher raw material costs for industrial chemicals.2010 PTOI and PTOI margin increases were driven by higher volume, higher selling prices, improved productivity and the absence of a net $54 million restructuring charge in 2009.Outlook Sales are expected to increase in 2012 as a result of the continued demand for titanium dioxide, fluoropolymers and industrial chemicals and higher selling prices. Segment earnings are also expected to increase consistent with the higher sales volume, higher selling prices and continued productivity actions.

The Kevlar® expansion at Cooper River, South Carolina was completed and began commercial supply at the end of 2011. 2010 versus 2009 The increase in sales volume reflects strong recovery and increased demand across all regions, led by EMEA and Asia Pacific, and all markets, particularly in aramid and nonwoven products. Further penetration in the U.S. commercial construction markets led to higher sales as recovery in global construction markets remained weak. Sales for consulting and training services improved modestly across most regions, led by Asia Pacific and EMEA.2010 PTOI and PTOI margin increases were primarily due to higher volume, particularly aramid and nonwoven products, and the absence of a net $45 million restructuring charge in 2009, partially offset by higher spending for growth initiatives and higher raw material costs.Outlook For 2012, sales are expected to benefit from improved global market conditions which are anticipated to recover in the second half 2012 with demand for Kevlar®, Nomex® and Tyvek® products expected to increase across all regions and market segments. Sales related to the Sustainable Solutions business are expected to increase due to clean technologies businesses and consulting growth in the areas of process safety management and sustainable operations. Sales related to the Building Innovations business are expected to increase due to further penetration in commercial construction applications.

The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. The company's current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings provide excellent access to the capital markets. In addition, spending and capital productivity actions have been implemented. The company will continue to monitor the financial markets in order to respond to changing conditions. Depending on these conditions, the proceeds of commercial paper may be invested in cash equivalents or marketable securities. Pursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities provide primary liquidity to support all short-term obligations. A substantial majority of the company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held by foreign subsidiaries and is considered to be indefinitely reinvested and expected to be utilized to fund local operating activities and capital expenditure requirements. The company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic liquidity to further support its assumption that undistributed earnings at December 31, 2011 can be considered reinvested indefinitely. The company has access to approximately $4.4 billion in unused credit lines with several major financial institutions, 26Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued as additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes, including letters of credit. The company continually reviews its debt portfolio and occasionally may rebalance it to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum debt maturity schedule. In 2011, the company issued $2.0 billion in Senior Notes and $1.0 billion in commercial paper to finance the acquisition of Danisco. Additionally, the company assumed $0.7 billion in debt as part of the acquisition, which was refinanced through the issuance of commercial paper. The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital market and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows: Long-termShort-termOutlookStandard & Poor'sAA-1StableMoody’s Investors ServiceA2P-1StableFitch RatingsAF1Stable(Dollars in millions)201120102009Cash provided by operating activities$5,152$4,559$4,741Cash provided by operating activities increased $593 million in 2011 compared to 2010.

Higher spending in 2011 and 2010 reflects the company's continued investment in capacity expansion to support areas of growth. The company expects 2012 purchases of plant, property and equipment to be about $2.1 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion over 2011, driven by continued growth investments aligned with the company's global trends.(Dollars in millions)201120102009Cash provided by (used for) financing activities$403$(1,829)$(97)The $2.2 billion change in 2011 was primarily due to an increase in borrowings in 2011 to finance the Danisco acquisition as compared to a decrease in borrowings in 2010.The $1.7 billion increase in cash used for financing activities in 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings in 2010 as compared to an increase in borrowings in 2009. This was partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of cash used to repurchase common stock. 27Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.5 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.64 in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The common dividend declared in the first quarter 2012 was the company's 430th consecutive dividend since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904.The company's Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share buyback plan in June 2001. During 2011, the company purchased and retired 13.8 million shares at a total cost of $672 million under this plan. During 2010, the company purchased and retired 5.4 million shares at a total cost of $250 million under this plan. During 2009, there were no purchases of stock under this plan. As of December 31, 2011, the company has purchased 39.7 million shares at a total cost of $1.9 billion. In April 2011, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share buyback plan. This plan will not commence until the plan authorized in June 2001 is completed. There is no expiration date on the current authorizations.

All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Long-term Employee BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan obligations or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.About 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. The company utilizes published long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate at measurement date. Where commonly available, the company considers indices of various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments.Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into 28Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plans' assets.In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)201120102009Market-related value of assets$13.9$13.9$14.0Fair value of plan assets13.914.813.9For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2011:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/2 PercentagePointIncrease1/2 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$97$(101)Expected rate of return on plan assets88(88)Additional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 32 and in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental MattersDuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $416 million in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2011; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to three times the amount accrued.Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is 29Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Income TaxesThe breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant, however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.At December 31, 2011, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $8.0 billion, net of valuation allowance of $2.0 billion. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax asset balance.Valuation of AssetsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized.Based on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test in 2011, no impairments exist at this time. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. 30Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Long-term Employee BenefitsThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability and life insurance protection for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company made a contribution of $500 million in 2010 to its principal U.S. pension plan and no contributions were made in 2011. In January 2012, the company contributed $500 million to its principal U.S. pension plan. The company expects to make contributions to its principal U.S. pension plan beyond 2012; however, the amount of any contributions is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows.Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $341 million to its pension plans in 2011 and anticipates that it will make approximately $345 million in contributions in 2012 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan.The company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $312 million, $321 million and $323 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $315 million in 2012. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:(Dollars in millions)201120102009Defined benefit plan charges$656$557$155Defined contribution plan charges294254245Other long-term employee benefit plan charges184219220 $1,134$1,030$620The above charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The increase in pension expense in 2011 is primarily related to the decrease in discount rates and the increase in pension expense in 2010 is primarily related to decreases in the market-related value of the assets in the principal U.S. pension plan. See ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 28 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan.The company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 32Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2012, long-term employee benefits expense is expected to increase by about $225 million, primarily due to lower discount rates.Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations are summarized below:(Dollars in millions)201120102009Environmental operating costs$587$551$528Increase in remediation accrual929389 $679$644$617About 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2011 resulted from operations in the U.S. The increases in total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to operations were due primarily to acquired businesses and increased environmental research activities. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Environmental Operating CostsAs a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. Remediation AccrualChanges in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2009$396Remediation payments(82)Increase in remediation accrual93Balance at December 31, 2010$407Remediation payments(83)Increase in remediation accrual92Balance at December 31, 2011$416Annual expenditures are expected to continue to increase in the near future; however, they are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. As of December 31, 2011, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state laws at about 410 sites around the U.S., with active remediation under way at approximately 160 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 170 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at six new sites during 2011 compared with ten and three similar notices in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 33Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2011. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company.Environmental Capital ExpendituresIn 2011, the company spent approximately $85 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $110 million in 2012. In the U.S., additional capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, management does not believe that the costs to comply with these requirements will have a material impact on the financial position or liquidity of the company. Climate ChangeThe company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. The company has made its overall portfolio less energy and emissions intensive, reducing 2010 absolute energy use by 6 percent since 1990 while significantly increasing production. In addition, the company sourced 6 percent of 2010 total energy use from renewable resources. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. About $1.6 billion of the company's 2010 revenue was generated from sales of products that help direct and downstream customers reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.The company has achieved major global reductions in GHG emissions since it began taking action in the early 1990's. The company is actively engaged in the effort to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services.At the national and regional level, there are existing efforts to address climate change. Several of the company's facilities in the European Union (EU) are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. In other countries, including the U.S., policy debate continues. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S. adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. If in the absence of federal legislation, states were to implement programs mandating GHG emissions reductions, the company, its suppliers and customers could be competitively disadvantaged by the added administrative costs of complying with a variety of state-specific requirements.In 2010, EPA launched a phased-in scheme to regulate GHG emissions first from large stationary sources under CAA permitting requirements administered by state and local authorities. As a result, large capital investments may be required to install Best Available Control Technology on major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. This type of GHG emissions regulation by EPA, in the absence of or in addition to federal legislation, could result in more costly, less efficient facility-by-facility controls versus a federal, market-based cap and trade program. Differences in regional or national legislation could present challenges in a global marketplace highlighting the need for coordinated global policy action.RegistrationThe European Union's regulatory framework concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) entered into force in 2007 and requires manufacturers and importers to gather and register information on the properties of their substances that meet certain volume or toxicological criteria. The company has successfully integrated REACH registration requirements into its safety, health & environment processes and timely met all such requirements to date. REACH also contains a mechanism for the progressive substitution of the most dangerous chemicals when suitable alternatives have been identified. Depending on which chemicals are identified, the requirement to use safer alternatives could necessitate changes in production processes. 34Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued PFOAThe Performance Chemicals segment uses a form of PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) as a processing aid to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. The Performance Materials segment uses PFOA in the manufacture of raw materials for perfluoroelastomer parts and some fluoroelastomers. In the fall of 2002, DuPont began producing rather than purchasing PFOA to support these manufacturing processes. PFOA is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. As a result, EPA initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources of PFOA in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to PFOA is occurring. In 2005, EPA issued a draft risk assessment on PFOA stating that the cancer data for PFOA may be best described as ""suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential"" under EPA's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. The EPA risk assessment is ongoing. Although EPA has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks associated with PFOA, it also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any products because of concerns about PFOA. DuPont respects EPA's position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of PFOA and DuPont and other companies have outlined plans to continue research, emission reduction and product stewardship activities to help address EPA's questions. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to EPA's 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. DuPont has exceeded the EPA's 2010 objective. In February 2007, DuPont announced its commitment to no longer make, use or buy PFOA by 2015, or sooner if possible. To achieve this goal, DuPont developed PFOA replacement technology and is converting customers to fluoropolymer resins and dispersions manufactured using the replacement technology. DuPont has been introducing its next generation fluorotelomers products and converting customers to their use. In 2009, EPA issued a national Provisional Health Advisory for PFOA of 0.4 parts per billion (ppb) in drinking water. In 2007, NJDEP identified a preliminary drinking-water guidance level for PFOA of 0.04 ppb as part of the first phase of an ongoing process to establish a state drinking-water standard. For additional information regarding PFOA matters, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKDerivatives and Other Hedging InstrumentsIn the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes the impacts of the company's foreign currency hedging program on the company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and includes the company's pro rata share of its equity affiliates' exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts:(Dollars in millions)201120102009Pre-tax exchange loss$(163)$(13)$(205)Tax benefit (expense)82(71)91After-tax exchange loss$(81)$(84)$(114)In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.35Table of ContentsPart IIITEM 7A.

Concentration of Credit RiskThe company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. As of December 31, 2011, no one individual customer balance represented more than 5 percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region.",2023-12-30 21:52:01.809642

All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company's strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position, anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions, outcome of contingencies, such as litigation and environmental matters, expenditures and financial results, are forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be accurate or realized. Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. Some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are:•Fluctuations in energy and raw material prices;•Failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; •Outcome of significant litigation and environmental matters, including those related to divested businesses;•Failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues;•Effect of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations or political conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which the company operates;•Conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, including economic factors, such as inflation, deflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as regulatory requirements;•Impact of business disruptions, including supply disruptions, and security threats, regardless of cause, including acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters;•Inability to protect and enforce the company's intellectual property rights; and•Successful integration of acquired businesses and completion of divestitures of underperforming or non-strategic assets or businesses. For some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements, see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 8.OverviewPurpose DuPont is a science company. We work collaboratively to find sustainable, innovative, market-driven solutions to solve some of the world's biggest challenges, making lives better, safer, and healthier for people everywhere.Strategy The company's strategy for growth is to apply its science and technology to address three challenges driven by global population growth: feeding the world, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and keeping people and the environment safe. Critical areas for the company's growth are innovation, differential management and productivity. Applying science to deliver innovative solutions and new products in the marketplace generates shareholder value and profitable growth. Differential management is a disciplined process to prioritize and allocate resources across businesses and geographies aligned with growth opportunities. The company continues to achieve fixed cost, working capital and variable cost productivity through disciplined business processes called DuPont Integrated Business Management (DIBM) and DuPont Production System (DPS). DIBM focuses on the business supply chain to maximize efficiency and optimize working capital, while DPS focuses on productivity outcomes to eliminate operational inefficiencies and improve lead time, cycle time and quality. The company is committed to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth.Results In 2012, sales were up 3 percent as strong increases in the Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, and Industrial Biosciences segments were partly offset by lower sales for the remaining segments, particularly Performance Chemicals. The latter had financial results reflecting a declining business trend after reaching cyclical peaks for sales and earnings in 2011 and the first half of 2012. Total company sales grew 6 percent in developing markets, which include China, India, and the countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Sales of new products introduced in the last four years also contributed to sales growth. The company exceeded its three-year 2010-2012 plan of $1 billion fixed cost productivity actions and $1 billion working capital productivity. 17Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of OperationsDivestiture of Performance Coatings In third quarter 2012, the company entered into a definitive agreement with Flash Bermuda Co. Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company formed by affiliates of The Carlyle Group (collectively referred to as ""Carlyle"") in which Carlyle agreed to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the company's Performance Coatings business for approximately $4.9 billion in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. On February 1, 2013, the sale of Performance Coatings was completed, resulting in about $4.0 billion in after-tax proceeds.In accordance with GAAP, the results of Performance Coatings are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Acquisition of Danisco In 2011, the company acquired Danisco in a transaction valued at $6.4 billion, plus net debt assumed of $0.6 billion. As part of this acquisition, DuPont incurred $85 million in transaction related costs during 2011, which were recorded in costs of goods sold and other operating charges. In 2011, the businesses acquired from Danisco contributed net sales of $1.7 billion and net income attributable to DuPont of $(7) million, which excludes $30 million after-tax ($39 million pre-tax) of additional interest expense related to the debt issued to finance the acquisition. Danisco's contributions included a $125 million after-tax ($175 million pre-tax) charge related to the fair value step-up of inventories acquired and sold during 2011.

The 2 percent decline in worldwide sales volume principally reflects higher Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, and Industrial Biosciences volume, more than offset by lower volume for the other segments combined, particularly Performance Chemicals. Higher local prices were driven principally by increases for seeds, titanium dioxide, and specialty polymers. Currency effect primarily reflects the weaker Euro and Brazilian Real.

Local selling prices were significantly higher for titanium dioxide, seeds, fluoroproducts and electronic products, with the latter reflecting pass through pricing for higher precious metals costs. Worldwide sales volume increased 1 percent as strong volume growth in Agriculture was largely offset by declines in Electronic & Communications, Performance Chemicals and Performance Materials. The declines occurred primarily during the fourth quarter, resulting from destocking in photovoltaics, polymer and industrial supply chains, as well as weaker demand for company products supplying consumer electronics and construction. Volume growth in Latin America was driven by Agriculture and Safety & Protection. Sales in developing markets of $11.2 billion improved 29 percent from 2010, and the percentage of total company sales in these markets increased to 33 percent from 31 percent in 2010.(Dollars in millions)201220112010OTHER INCOME, NET$498$742$1,1992012 versus 2011 The $244 million decrease was largely attributable to a $228 million reduction of Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income, a decrease of $92 million in equity in earnings of affiliates, and an increase of $69 million in net pre-tax exchange losses, partially offset by a $122 million gain related to the sale of the company's interest in an equity method investment.2011 versus 2010 The $457 million decrease was largely attributable to a $201 million reduction of Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income, an increase of $134 million in net pre-tax exchange losses, the absence of a benefit of $59 million recorded in 2010 related to accrued interest associated with settlements of income tax contingencies related to prior years, the absence of $41 million in insurance recoveries and a $32 million decrease in net gains on sales of assets.

The plan is designed to eliminate corporate costs previously allocated to the Performance Coatings business as well as utilize additional cost-cutting actions to improve competitiveness. As a result, pre-tax charges of $234 million were recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net. The 2012 restructuring program charges consist of $157 million of employee separation costs, $8 million of other non-personnel charges, and $69 million of asset related charges, which includes $30 million of asset impairments and $39 million of asset shut downs. The company expects this plan and all related payments to be substantially complete by December 31, 2013. The actions related to this plan are expected to achieve pre-tax cost savings of approximately $300 million in 2013 increasing to $450 million per year in subsequent years.20Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2011 Restructuring ProgramIn 2011, the company initiated a series of actions to achieve the expected cost synergies associated with the Danisco acquisition. As a result, the company recorded a $53 million charge in employee separation/asset related charges, net, primarily for employee separation costs in the U.S. and Europe.In the fourth quarter 2012, the company recorded a net reduction of $15 million in the estimated costs associated with the 2011 restructuring program. This net reduction was primarily due to workforce reductions through non-severance programs and lower than estimated individual severance costs. The actions and payments related to the 2011 restructuring program were substantially complete as of December 31, 2012.Asset ImpairmentsDuring 2012, the company recorded asset impairment charges of $275 million to write-down the carrying value of certain asset groups to fair value. These asset impairment charges resulted in a $150 million charge within the Electronics & Communications segment, a $92 million charge within the Performance Materials segment and a $33 million charge within the Performance Chemicals segment.Additional details related to the restructuring programs and asset impairments discussed above can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Below is a summary of the net impact related to items recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net: (Dollars in millions)2012 (Charges) and Credits2011 (Charges) and Credits2010 (Charges)and CreditsAgriculture$(11)$—$—Electronics & Communications(159)—8Industrial Biosciences(3)(9)—Nutrition & Health(49)(14)—Performance Chemicals(36)—10Performance Materials(104)(2)16Safety & Protection(58)—5Other11(28)1Corporate expenses(84)——Total (Charges) Credits$(493)$(53)$40(Dollars in millions)201220112010PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS$622$626$515Effective income tax rate20.0%16.6%15.8%In 2012, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $622 million, reflecting a marginal decrease from 2011. The increase in the 2012 effective tax rate compared to 2011 was primarily due to geographic mix of earnings, in addition to the absence of certain U.S. business tax provisions in 2012 (extended retroactively to 2012 in first quarter 2013).In 2011, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $626 million, reflecting an increase from 2010 largely due to pre-tax earnings growth, which was partially offset by the impact associated with the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations.See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations, as well as items that significantly impact the company's effective income tax rate.21Part IIITEM 7.

The changes between periods were due to the reasons noted above.Corporate OutlookThe company expects 2013 sales and earnings to benefit from modest growth in global gross domestic product and industrial production. The company’s market position and financial results will continue to be enhanced by market-driven innovation and productivity. Raw material, energy and freight costs are expected to increase, principally due to higher seed input costs and titanium ore. Currency impact for the full-year 2013 versus 2012 is expected to be flat. The company expects a dynamic market environment, including strong Agriculture demand and significant headwinds related to the cyclical nature of the titanium dioxide industry affecting the Performance Chemicals segment. Segment ReviewsSegment sales include transfers to another business segment. Products are transferred between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the market value of the products. Segment pre-tax operating income (loss) (PTOI) is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes excluding exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. All references to prices are on a U.S. dollar (USD) basis, including the impact of currency. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated net sales and segment PTOI to income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2012, 2011 and 2010 is included in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.AGRICULTURE(Dollars in millions)201220112010Segment sales$10,426$9,166$7,845PTOI$1,594$1,527$1,293PTOI margin15%17%16% 20122011Change in segment sales from prior period due to: Price6%6%Volume8%10%Portfolio / Other—%1%Total change14%17%2012 versus 2011 Pioneer seed sales reflect growth primarily in corn and soybean seeds.

Volume increases in all regions reflect increased planted area and market position. Pricing gains in all regions reflect the introduction and penetration of new products including Optimum® AcreMax® 1 into the North America corn lineup. Crop Protection sales growth reflects both volume and price gains with increases in insect control, weed control and fungicides product sales, particularly continued strong demand for 22Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Rynaxypyr® insecticide and continued expansion of picoxystrobin fungicides. Sales grew in all regions, particularly Latin America and Europe. 2011 PTOI and PTOI margin increased on continued new product penetration and leverage on volume growth, partially offset by a $175 million charge related to Imprelis®. Additionally, aligned with the segment's long-term plan, research and development expense increased 15 percent to support continued growth in breeding, biotechnology and crop chemistry. 2011 and 2010 PTOI each included a licensing agreement charge of $50 million. Outlook Pioneer anticipates continued strong demand in global corn and soybean markets, as well as pricing gains from new corn hybrids and soybean varieties and increased penetration of the Optimum® AcreMax® Family of integrated and reduced refuge corn hybrids and Optimum® AQUAmaxTM products for improved drought tolerance. Pioneer anticipates PTOI growth in 2013 reflecting higher sales, partially offset by higher seed input costs resulting from commodity price increases and the multi year weather related impact on production yields, as well as continued investment in commercial and R&D activities to support growth.In the Crop Protection business, sales and earnings growth in 2013 is expected in all regions, and for all product groups, primarily in insect control products and fungicides. Sales and PTOI are expected to benefit from continued growth of Rynaxypyr®, broad registrations in new markets for CyazypyrTM insect control products, as well as the launch of picoxystrobin fungicides in the U.S. and continued expansion of penthiopyrad fungicide.

PTOI margin decreased primarily reflecting lower volume.2011 versus 2010 Sales growth reflects higher selling prices, primarily pass-through of metals prices. Lower sales volume primarily reflects destocking in PV and softness in consumer electronics in the second half 2011, which more than offset strong demand in all market segments in the first half 2011. 2011 PTOI decreased primarily due to lower volume in the second half 2011. PTOI margin decreased primarily reflecting higher metal prices, as well as weaker product mix.Outlook For 2013, sales are expected to increase slightly on higher volumes. PV installations are expected to be essentially flat versus 2012. Sales volumes are anticipated to improve as inventories across the value chain are at reasonable levels entering into 2013, offset in part by lower materials usage in modules. Sales into consumer electronics, driven by smart phones and tablets, are expected to be soft in the first half of the year with stronger demand in second half.

PTOI also included $49 million of amortization expense associated with the fair value step-up of the acquired intangible assets.Outlook For 2013, sales are expected to increase driven by strong demand for enablers, probiotics and cultures. Growth is expected in all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific and Latin America, in the areas of nutrition solutions, improved health and food protection. Volume growth, mix enrichment, cost synergies derived from integration and productivity gains, partially offset by raw material increases, are expected to contribute to earnings and PTOI margin improvement.PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS(Dollars in millions)201220112010Segment sales$7,188$7,794$6,322PTOI$1,586$1,923$1,081PTOI margin22%25%17% 20122011Change in segment sales from prior period due to: Price4 %26 %Volume(12)%(3)%Portfolio / Other— %— %Total change(8)%23 %2012 versus 2011 Lower sales volume primarily reflects softness in titanium dioxide in all regions and weak demand in fluoropolymers.

The increase in sales reflects favorable pricing for titanium dioxide and fluoropolymers, as well as pass-through pricing of higher raw material costs for fluorochemicals and industrial chemicals. 2011 PTOI and PTOI margin improved driven by the higher selling prices and fixed cost productivity. Outlook Sales are expected to decrease in 2013 reflecting weaker pricing for titanium dioxide and fluoropolymers, partially offset by strong demand for industrial chemicals. Segment earnings are also expected to decrease as productivity actions are more than offset by lower titanium dioxide prices.

Lower sales volume reflect broad-based channel destocking with softening in consumer and industrial markets in the second half 2011, and production-related supply issues in ethylene-based polymers. 2011 PTOI was essentially flat. 2011 PTOI included a $49 million benefit from the gain on the sale of a business. 2010 PTOI included a combined $58 million gain on an asset purchase due to the acquisition and early termination of a supply agreement, a gain on the sale of a business and an insurance recovery. Lower PTOI margin primarily reflects feedstock costs increasing at a higher rate than selling prices.Outlook 2013 sales are expected to grow due to anticipated increases in global motor vehicle OEM builds, particularly in China. The segment is also expected to benefit from volume growth in the consumer and industrial markets. PTOI is expected to improve due to the impact of higher volume and science-based innovations for products and processes, partially offset by higher feedstock costs.26Part IIITEM 7.

Additionally, Kevlar® and Nomex® sales are expected to improve as the year progresses from more consistent spending in the public sector. Higher demand for Sustainable Solutions offerings are expected, including growth in the areas of process safety management and sustainable operations. Building Innovations sales are expected to increase due to the continued recovery in the U.S. housing market, new product introductions and continued penetration in commercial construction applications.

The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. The company's current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings provide excellent access to the capital markets. In addition, spending and capital productivity actions have been implemented. The company will continue to monitor the financial markets in order to respond to changing conditions. Depending on these conditions, the proceeds of commercial paper may be invested in cash equivalents or marketable securities. Pursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities provide primary liquidity to support all short-term debt obligations. A substantial majority of the company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held by foreign subsidiaries and is considered to be indefinitely reinvested and expected to be utilized to fund local operating activities and capital expenditure requirements. The company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic liquidity to further support its assumption that undistributed earnings at December 31, 2012 can be considered reinvested indefinitely. The company has access to approximately $4.3 billion in unused credit lines with several major financial institutions, as additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes, including letters of credit. The company continually reviews its debt portfolio and occasionally may rebalance it to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum debt maturity schedule. In 2011, the company issued $2.0 billion in Senior Notes and $1.0 billion in commercial paper to finance the acquisition of Danisco. Additionally, the company assumed $0.7 billion in debt as part of the acquisition, which was refinanced through the issuance of commercial paper. The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital market and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating.

The decrease was due mainly to the absence in 2012 of the company's Danisco acquisition in 2011.The $3.8 billion increase in 2011 was mainly due to the payment for the Danisco acquisition, higher expenditures for the purchases of property, plant and equipment, and a net increase in payments for forward exchange contract settlements; partially offset by changes in investments in short-term financial instruments.Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.8 billion in 2012 and 2011, and $1.5 billion in 2010.

Dividends per share of common stock were $1.70, $1.64, and $1.64 in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The common dividend declared in the first quarter 2013 was the company's 434th consecutive dividend since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904.During 2012, the company purchased and retired 7.8 million shares at a total cost of $400 million. These purchases completed the 2001 $2 billion share buyback plan and began purchases under a $2 billion share buyback plan authorized by the company's Board of Directors in April 2011. Under the completed 2001 plan, the company purchased a total of 42.0 million shares. As of December 31, 2012, the company has purchased 5.5 million shares at a total cost of $284 million under the 2011 plan. There is no required completion date for the purchases under the 2011 plan. In December 2012, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share buyback plan, subject to receiving the proceeds from the Performance Coatings divestiture. On February 1, 2013, the sale of Performance Coatings was completed. The 2012 share buyback plan is expected to be completed in the first half 2013.During 2011 and 2010, the company purchased and retired 13.8 million and 5.4 million shares at a total cost of $672 million and $250 million, respectively, under the 2001 plan.(Dollars in millions)201220112010Cash provided by operating activities$4,849$5,152$4,559Purchases of property, plant and equipment(1,793)(1,843)(1,508)Free cash flow$3,056$3,309$3,051Free cash flow is a measurement not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process.29Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Long-term Employee BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.About 76 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S. the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plan's actuary as of the measurement date. For non-U.S. benefit plans, the company utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plans' assets.In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)201220112010Market-related value of assets$14.8$13.9$13.9Fair value of plan assets15.113.914.8For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets. 30Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2012:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/2 PercentagePointIncrease1/2 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$107$(114)Expected rate of return on plan assets92(92)Additional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 34 and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental MattersDuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $436 million as of December 31, 2012; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to three times the amount accrued.Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Income TaxesThe breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant, however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a 31Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.At December 31, 2012, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $7.8 billion, net of valuation allowance of $1.9 billion. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax asset balance.Valuation of AssetsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses. During 2012, the company recorded asset impairments charges of $275 million to write-down the carrying value of certain asset groups to fair value. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to these charges.Based on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test in 2012, no impairments exist at this time. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. 32Part IIITEM 7.

At December 31, 2012, approximately $140 million of the company's contractual obligations relate to the Performance Coatings business, which primarily represents operating leases.The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations.33Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Long-term Employee BenefitsThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability and life insurance protection for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 76 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company made a contribution of $500 million in 2010 to its principal U.S. pension plan and no contributions were made in 2011. In January 2012, the company contributed $500 million to its principal U.S. pension plan and anticipates no contributions will be made in 2013. The company expects to make contributions to its principal U.S. pension plan beyond 2013; however, the amount of any contributions is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows.Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $848 million to its pension plans in 2012 and anticipates that it will make approximately $340 million in contributions in 2013 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan.The company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $261 million, $312 million and $321 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $260 million in 2013. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.During the third quarter 2012, the company amended its U.S. parent company retiree medical and dental plans for Medicare-eligible pensioners and survivors. Beginning in 2013, the company is replacing the coverage for Medicare-eligible plan participants in the company sponsored plans with a new company-funded Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA). Medicare-eligible plan participants will enroll in individual health plans in the open market and the company will reimburse their health care expenses with an HRA based on the provisions of the amended plans. As a result of this change, the company's other long-term employee benefit expense was reduced by approximately $46 million in 2012. For 2013, the plan amendment is expected to result in a reduction in other long-term employee benefit expense by about $120 million. Additional information related to these changes in the plans noted above is included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 34Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:(Dollars in millions)201220112010Long-term employee benefit plan charges 1$1,321$1,134$1,0301. The long-term employee benefit plan charges relating to discontinued operations was $74, $72 and $71 for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.The above charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The increase in long-term employee benefit expense in 2012 is primarily related to the decrease in discount rates and lower return on plan assets, partially offset by plan amendments to the company's U.S. parent company retiree medical and dental plans. The increase in long-term employee benefit expense in 2011 is primarily related to the decrease in discount rates. See ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 30 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan.The company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2013, long-term employee benefits expense from continuing operations is expected to decrease by about $30 million.Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations are summarized below:(Dollars in millions)201220112010Environmental operating costs$595$562$521Increase in remediation accrual1109293 $705$654$614About 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2012 resulted from operations in the U.S. The increases in total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to operations were due primarily to increased environmental research activities and acquired businesses. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Environmental Operating CostsAs a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. 35Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Remediation AccrualChanges in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2010$407Remediation payments(83)Increase in remediation accrual92Balance at December 31, 2011$416Remediation payments(90)Increase in remediation accrual110Balance at December 31, 2012$436Annual expenditures are expected to continue to increase in the near future; however, they are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. As of December 31, 2012, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state laws at about 415 sites around the U.S., with active remediation under way at approximately 160 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 175 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at five new sites during 2012 compared with six and ten similar notices in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2012. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company.Environmental Capital ExpendituresIn 2012, the company spent approximately $65 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $85 million in 2013. In the U.S., additional capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the CAA. Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, management does not believe that the costs to comply with these requirements will have a material impact on the financial position or liquidity of the company. Climate ChangeThe company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2004, the company reduced its environmental footprint achieving in 2011 year-over-year reductions of eight percent in GHG emissions and nine percent in water consumption. In addition, the company achieved a year-over-year reduction of 2.4 percent in 2011 in energy use from non-renewable resources. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. About $1.9 billion of the company's 2012 revenue was generated from sales of products that help direct and downstream customers GHG emissions.The company is actively engaged in the effort to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services.36Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued At the national and regional level, there are existing efforts to address climate change. Several of the company's facilities in the European Union (EU) are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. In other countries, including the U.S., policy debate continues. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S. adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. If in the absence of federal legislation, states were to implement programs mandating GHG emissions reductions, the company, its suppliers and customers could be competitively disadvantaged by the added administrative costs of complying with a variety of state-specific requirements.In 2010, EPA launched a phased-in scheme to regulate GHG emissions first from large stationary sources under CAA permitting requirements administered by state and local authorities. As a result, large capital investments may be required to install Best Available Control Technology on major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. This type of GHG emissions regulation by EPA, in the absence of or in addition to federal legislation, could result in more costly, less efficient facility-by-facility controls versus a federal program that incorporates policies that provide an economic balance that does not severely distort markets. Differences in regional or national legislation could present challenges in a global marketplace highlighting the need for coordinated global policy action.RegistrationThe European Union's regulatory framework concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) entered into force in 2007 and requires manufacturers and importers to gather and register information on the properties of their substances that meet certain volume or toxicological criteria. The company has successfully integrated REACH registration requirements into its safety, health & environment processes and timely met all such requirements to date. REACH also contains a mechanism for the progressive substitution of the most dangerous chemicals when suitable alternatives have been identified. Depending on which chemicals are identified, the requirement to use safer alternatives could necessitate changes in production processes. PFOAThe Performance Chemicals segment uses a form of PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) as a processing aid to manufacture some fluoropolymer resins. The Performance Materials segment uses PFOA in the manufacture of certain raw materials for perfluoroelastomer parts (and some fluoroelastomers). In the fall of 2002, DuPont began producing rather than purchasing PFOA to support these manufacturing processes. PFOA is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. As a result, EPA initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources of PFOA in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to PFOA is occurring. Although EPA has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks associated with PFOA, it also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any products because of concerns about PFOA. DuPont respects EPA's position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of PFOA. DuPont and other companies continue research, emission reduction and product stewardship activities to help address EPA's questions. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to EPA's 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. DuPont has exceeded the EPA's 2010 objective. In February 2007, DuPont announced its commitment to no longer make, use or buy PFOA by 2015, or sooner if possible. To achieve this goal, DuPont developed PFOA replacement technology and is converting customers to fluoropolymer resins and dispersions manufactured using the replacement technology. DuPont has been introducing its next generation fluorotelomers products and converting customers to their use. For additional information regarding PFOA matters, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.37Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKDerivatives and Other Hedging InstrumentsIn the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes the impacts of the company's foreign currency hedging program on the company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, and includes the company's pro rata share of its equity affiliates' exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts:(Dollars in millions)201220112010Pre-tax exchange loss$(215)$(146)$(11)Tax benefit (expense)7381(69)After-tax exchange loss$(142)$(65)$(80)In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Sensitivity AnalysisThe following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the market prices or rates that existed at December 31, 2012 and 2011. The sensitivity for interest rate swaps is based on a one percent change in the market interest rate. Foreign currency and commodity contracts sensitivities are based on a 10 percent change in market rates.

Concentration of Credit RiskThe company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. As of December 31, 2012, no one individual customer balance represented more than 5 percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region.38Part II",2023-12-30 21:52:07.121169

All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company's strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position, anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions, outcome of contingencies, such as litigation and environmental matters, expenditures and financial results, are forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be accurate or realized. Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. Some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are:•Fluctuations in energy and raw material prices;•Failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; •Outcome of significant litigation and environmental matters, including those related to divested businesses;•Failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues;•Effect of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations or political conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which the company operates;•Conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, including economic factors, such as inflation, deflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as regulatory requirements;•Impact of business disruptions, including supply disruptions, and security threats, regardless of cause, including acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters;•Ability to protect and enforce the company's intellectual property rights; and•Successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-strategic assets or businesses, including proposed spin-off of the Performance Chemicals segment. For some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements, see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 8.OverviewPurpose DuPont’s businesses serve markets where the increasing demand for more and healthier food, renewably sourced materials and fuels, and advanced industrial materials is creating substantial growth opportunities. The company’s unique combination of sciences, proven R&D engine, broad global reach, and deep market penetration are distinctive competitive advantages that position the company to continue capitalizing on this enormous potential. Strategy Position DuPont as a higher growth, higher value company, well equipped to drive revenue and profit growth through science-based innovation and the company’s significant competitive advantages with three priorities:•Agriculture & Nutrition - extend DuPont’s leadership across the high-value, science-driven segments of the Agriculture and Food value chain;•Advanced Materials - strengthen the company’s lead as a provider of differentiated, high-value advanced industrial materials;•Industrial Biosciences - build transformational new bio-based businesses by combining DuPont’s world leading science with expertise and resources from the Advanced Materials and Agriculture & Nutrition businesses. The company is committed to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth.Results Income from continuing operations after taxes increased 16 percent to $2.9 billion. Net sales of $35.7 billion increased 3 percent driven by 5 percent higher volume. Sales grew 6 percent in developing markets, which include China, India, and the countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Sales of new products introduced in the last four years also contributed to sales growth. 16Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of OperationsSeparation of Performance Chemicals On October 24, 2013, DuPont announced that it intends to separate its Performance Chemicals segment through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders, subject to customary closing conditions. The company expects to complete the separation about mid-2015. Divestiture of Performance Coatings On August 30, 2012, the company entered into a definitive agreement with Flash Bermuda Co. Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company formed by affiliates of The Carlyle Group (collectively referred to as ""Carlyle"") in which Carlyle agreed to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the company's Performance Coatings business. In February 2013, the sale was completed resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax). The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2013.In accordance with GAAP, the results of Performance Coatings are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Acquisition of Danisco In 2011, the company acquired Danisco in a transaction valued at $6.4 billion, plus net debt assumed of $0.6 billion. As part of this acquisition, DuPont incurred $85 million in transaction related costs during 2011, which were recorded in other operating charges. In 2011, the businesses acquired from Danisco contributed net sales of $1.7 billion and net income attributable to DuPont of $(7) million, which excludes $30 million after-tax ($39 million pre-tax) of additional interest expense related to the debt issued to finance the acquisition. Danisco's contributions included a $125 million after-tax ($175 million pre-tax) charge related to the fair value step-up of inventories acquired and sold during 2011.

The 2 percent decline in worldwide sales volume principally reflects higher Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, and Industrial Biosciences volume, more than offset by lower volume for the other segments combined, particularly Performance Chemicals. Higher local prices were driven principally by increases for seeds, titanium dioxide, and specialty polymers. Currency effect primarily reflects the weaker Euro and Brazilian Real. Sales in developing markets of $11.1 billion improved 6 percent from 2011, and the percentage of total company sales in these markets increased to 32 percent from 31 percent in 2011.(Dollars in millions)201320122011OTHER INCOME, NET$410$498$7422013 versus 2012 The $88 million decrease was largely attributable to the absence of a $122 million gain related to the 2012 sale of the company's interest in an equity method investment, the absence of a $117 million gain related to the 2012 sale of a business within the Agriculture segment, partially offset by $87 million lower net pre-tax exchange losses, $27 million increase in interest income, and a $26 million re-measurement gain on an equity investment.2012 versus 2011 The $244 million decrease was largely attributable to a $228 million reduction of Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income, a decrease of $92 million in equity in earnings of affiliates, and an increase of $69 million in net pre-tax exchange losses, partially offset by a $122 million gain related to the sale of the company's interest in an equity method investment.Additional information related to the company's other income, net is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(Dollars in millions)201320122011COST OF GOODS SOLD$22,548$21,538$21,264As a percent of net sales63%62%63%2013 versus 2012 Cost of goods sold (COGS) increased 5 percent to $22.5 billion, with 4 percent driven by higher sales volume and 1 percent driven by higher product costs. COGS as a percentage of net sales was 63 percent, a 1 percent increase from 2012. The increase in COGS as a percentage of net sales principally reflects the impact of increased costs for raw materials and agriculture inputs versus lower selling prices, coupled with adverse currency impact. 2012 versus 2011 COGS increased 1 percent to $21.5 billion. COGS as a percentage of net sales was 62 percent, a 1 percent decrease from 2011, principally reflecting selling price increases in excess of raw material cost increases.(Dollars in millions)201320122011OTHER OPERATING CHARGES$3,838$4,077$3,510As a percent of net sales11%12%10% 18Part IIITEM 7.

The net $15 million restructuring benefit consisted of a $24 million benefit associated with prior year restructuring programs offset by a $9 million charge resulting from restructuring actions related to a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The majority of the $24 million benefit was due to the achievement of work force reductions through non-severance programs associated with the 2012 restructuring program. 19Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The $493 million in charges recorded during 2012 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consisted of $234 million in charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, a $16 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with 2011 and prior years restructuring programs, and $275 million in asset impairment charges, as discussed below.2012 Restructuring ProgramIn 2012, the company commenced a restructuring plan to increase productivity, enhance competitiveness and accelerate growth. The plan is designed to eliminate corporate costs previously allocated to the Performance Coatings business as well as utilize additional cost-cutting actions to improve competitiveness. As a result, pre-tax charges of $234 million were recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net. The 2012 restructuring program charges consist of $157 million of employee separation costs, $8 million of other non-personnel charges, and $69 million of asset related charges, which includes $30 million of asset impairments and $39 million of asset shut downs.The actions related to this plan achieved pre-tax cost savings of more than $300 million in 2013, and is expected to increase to approximately $450 million per year in subsequent years. 2011 Restructuring ProgramIn 2011, the company initiated a series of actions to achieve the expected cost synergies associated with the Danisco acquisition. As a result, the company recorded a $53 million charge in employee separation/asset related charges, net, primarily for employee separation costs in the U.S. and Europe.In the fourth quarter 2012, the company recorded a net reduction of $15 million in the estimated costs associated with the 2011 restructuring program. This net reduction was primarily due to workforce reductions through non-severance programs and lower than estimated individual severance costs. Asset ImpairmentsDuring 2013, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of $129 million to write-down the carrying value of an asset group, within the Electronics & Communications segment, to fair value.During 2012, the company recorded asset impairment charges of $275 million to write-down the carrying value of certain asset groups to fair value. These asset impairment charges resulted in a $150 million charge within the Electronics & Communications segment, a $92 million charge within the Performance Materials segment and a $33 million charge within the Performance Chemicals segment.Additional details related to the restructuring programs and asset impairments discussed above can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Below is a summary of the net impact related to items recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net: (Dollars in millions)2013 (Charges) and Credits2012 (Charges) and Credits2011 (Charges) and CreditsAgriculture$1$(11)$—Electronics & Communications(131)(159)—Industrial Biosciences1(3)(9)Nutrition & Health6(49)(14)Performance Chemicals(2)(36)—Performance Materials(6)(104)(2)Safety & Protection4(58)—Other511(28)Corporate expenses8(84)—Total (Charges) Credits$(114)$(493)$(53) 20Part IIITEM 7.

The decrease in the 2013 effective tax rate compared to 2012 was primarily due to geographic mix of earnings, in addition to benefits associated with certain U.S. business tax provisions in 2013. In 2012, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $616 million, reflecting a marginal decrease from 2011. The increase in the 2012 effective tax rate compared to 2011 was primarily due to geographic mix of earnings, in addition to benefits associated with certain U.S. business tax provisions in 2011.See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations, as well as items that significantly impact the company's effective income tax rate.(Dollars in millions)201320122011INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES$2,863$2,472$3,232Income from continuing operations after income taxes for 2013 was $2.9 billion compared to $2.5 billion in 2012 and $3.2 billion in 2011. The changes between periods were due to the reasons noted above.Corporate OutlookThe company expects 2014 sales and earnings will reflect continuing improvement in global industrial production, lower agricultural input costs, and a slightly stronger average exchange value for the U.S. dollar. In addition, the company’s market position and results will continue to benefit from market driven innovation and productivity.Segment ReviewsSegment sales include transfers to another business segment. Products are transferred between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the market value of the products. Effective January 1, 2013, to better indicate operating performance, the company eliminated the allocation of non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs from segment pre-tax operating income (loss) (PTOI). Segment PTOI is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes excluding non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. Certain reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year classifications. All references to prices are on a U.S. dollar (USD) basis, including the impact of currency. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated net sales and segment PTOI to income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2013, 2012 and 2011 is included in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment PTOI and PTOI margins include certain items which management believes are significant to understanding the segment results discussed below. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to these items. 21Part IIITEM 7.

Growth in seeds reflects strong corn sales in North America and Brazil. Increased insecticide volumes were driven by demand for Rynaxypyr®, particularly in Latin America to combat heavy insect pressure, while fungicide volume increases were led by demand for picoxytstrobin in North America and Latin America.2013 PTOI and PTOI margin increased on sales growth, lower charges incurred related to Imprelis® herbicide claims, and earlier seed shipments, partially offset by higher seed input costs of about $350 million, $108 million of negative currency impact, and the absence of a $117 million gain on the sale of a business recorded in 2012. As a result of the earlier timing of seed shipments, representing earlier seed shipments for the Brazil safrinha corn season enabled by recent investments and earlier direct seed shipments to North American farmers, approximately $100 million of PTOI was realized in 2013 versus 2014. 2013 PTOI included net charges of $352 million ($425 million in charges offset by $73 million of insurance recoveries) related to Imprelis® herbicide claims compared charges of $575 million in 2012. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the Imprelis® matter. 2012 versus 2011 Pioneer seed sales reflect growth primarily in corn and soybean seeds. Volume increases in all regions reflect increased planted area. Global pricing gains reflect continued penetration of new genetics and trait packages, including the Optimum® AcreMax® Family of integrated and reduced refuge corn hybrids and Optimum® AQUAmaxTM products for improved drought tolerance. Crop Protection sales grew in all regions reflecting volume and price gains from herbicides, insect control products and fungicides, particularly continued strong demand for Rynaxypyr®.2012 PTOI increased as strong sales and a $117 million gain on the sale of a business more than offset $575 million of charges related to Imprelis®, higher input costs in seeds of about $275 million, $156 million of negative currency, and higher investments in commercial and R&D activities to support growth. 2012 PTOI margin decreased due to increased charges related to Imprelis®. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the Imprelis® matter. Outlook Sales are expected to be up modestly driven by continued demand and pricing gains. Growth in seeds is anticipated to be driven by pricing gains, largely in North America, and higher global volumes, offset slightly by the earlier timing of seed shipments discussed above. In Crop Protection, the company anticipates demand for Rynaxypyr® to continue, along with launches of Cyazypyr® insecticide and the continued expansion and growth of the fungicide portfolio. Along with sales growth, PTOI and margins are expected to improve benefiting from lower seed input costs compared to 2013 while continuing to make targeted investments for growth. 22Part IIITEM 7.

In addition, 2013 PTOI includes a $129 million asset impairment charge compared to a $150 million asset impairment charge recorded in 2012 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).2012 versus 2011 Sales declined on lower volume in PV materials, partially offset by increased demand for smart phones and tablets. Lower price primarily reflects pass-through of lower metals prices.2012 PTOI decreased on lower volume and a $150 million asset impairment charge, partially offset by a $122 million gain related to the sale of an equity method investment. PTOI margin decreased primarily reflecting lower volume.Outlook Sales are expected to be up slightly in 2014 on volume gains largely offset by lower selling prices resulting from lower metals prices. Global installations of photovoltaic modules are expected to increase with mid-teen growth rates compared to 2013, driven by demand for solar energy in China, U.S., and developing markets. Sales into consumer electronics markets will continue to be driven by demand for smartphones and tablets. Earnings are expected to increase moderately as continued volume growth will be offset in part by the impact of lower metals prices. 23Part IIITEM 7.

Volume growth reflected strong sales of Sorona® polymer for carpeting, while lower price related to unfavorable currency impact. 2012 PTOI and PTOI margin increased reflecting benefits of the acquisition and the absence of a $70 million charge recorded in 2011 for the fair value step-up of inventories acquired. Outlook Sales are expected to increase moderately in 2014, driven by the introduction of new products.

Volume growth reflects increased demand for titanium dioxide, which was up 14 percent from 2012.2013 PTOI and PTOI margin decreased principally on lower selling prices. Volume gains were offset by higher raw material inventory costs, mainly ore costs. 2013 PTOI includes a $72 million charge related to titanium dioxide antitrust litigation (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) while 2012 PTOI included a $33 million asset impairment charge (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).2012 versus 2011 Lower sales volume primarily reflects softness in titanium dioxide in all regions and weak demand in fluoropolymers. Higher local price primarily reflects favorable pricing for titanium dioxide in the first half 2012, which more than offset unfavorable currency impact. 2012 PTOI and PTOI margin decreased as higher local prices were more than offset by lower volume, lower plant utilization and a $33 million asset impairment charge noted above. Outlook Sales are expected to be essentially flat with modest improvement in titanium dioxide and fluoropolymer demand offset by the impact of portfolio changes within industrial chemicals. Earnings are expected to improve slightly on higher volume and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher raw material inventory costs, principally ore costs. 25Part IIITEM 7.

The company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt maturities and other cash needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. The company's current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings provide excellent access to the capital markets. The company has access to approximately $4.4 billion in unused credit lines with several major financial institutions as additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes, including letters of credit. The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are $9,086 million and $4,407 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 include the proceeds received from the sale of the Performance Coatings business. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. of $3,889 million and $4,118 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are generally utilized to fund local operating activities and capital expenditure requirements and are expected to support non-U.S. liquidity needs for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The company expects domestic liquidity needs, for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter, will be met through existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. and other funding sources, including cash generated from U.S. operations, asset sales, the ability to access the capital markets, and the company's credit lines. Therefore, the company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic liquidity to support its assumption that undistributed earnings at December 31, 2013 can be considered reinvested indefinitely. The company continually reviews its debt portfolio and occasionally may rebalance it to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum debt maturity schedule. In 2013, the company issued $1,250 million of 2.80% Notes due February 15, 2023 and $750 million of 4.15% Notes due February 15, 2043.The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital.

Lower earnings were driven by the absence of 11 months of results from the Performance Coatings business as well as a decline in the Performance Chemicals segment. Higher working capital in the Agriculture segment was a result of higher trade receivables due to an increase in sales in the fourth quarter 2013 as well as an increase in customer credit sales in Latin America. In addition the Agriculture segment's working capital was negatively impacted in 2013 as a result of timing differences in when customer prepayments for the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons were collected. 28Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Cash provided by operating activities decreased $303 million in 2012 compared to 2011 due mainly to lower cash from earnings and a $500 million contribution to its principal US pension plan, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily related to working capital within the Agriculture segment. Other operating charges and credits primarily consists of expenses related to pension plans as well as reclassifications of items whose cash effects are included in investing or financing activities. The change in other operating charges and credits, net for 2013 totaled $0.9 billion, a decrease of $0.3 billion from 2012. The decrease is primarily due to lower pension plan charges. The change in other operating charges and credits, net for 2012 totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $0.2 billion from 2011. The increase is primarily due to increased pension plan charges.

The $3.1 billion increase in cash used for financing activities in 2012 was due mainly to a decrease in borrowings in 2012 versus an increase in 2011, less cash received from options exercised and the company's increased investment in Solae, LLC in 2012, partially offset by reduced purchases of common stock in 2012 versus 2011.Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.5 billion in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.78, $1.70, and $1.64 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. With the first quarter 2014 dividend, the company has paid quarterly consecutive dividends since the company’s first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904.In January 2014, the company’s Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan, with $2 billion expected to occur in 2014. This plan will replace the company’s 2011 plan. There is no required completion date for purchases under the 2014 plan.In December 2012, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share buyback plan. In February 2013, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement with a financial institution under which the company used $1 billion of the proceeds from the sale of Performance Coatings for the purchase of shares of common stock. The 2012 $1 billion share buyback plan was completed in the second quarter 2013 through the ASR agreement, under which the company purchased and retired 20.4 million shares. During 2012, the company purchased and retired 7.8 million shares at a total cost of $400 million. These purchases completed the 2001 $2 billion share buyback plan and began purchases under a $2 billion share buyback plan authorized by the company's Board of Directors in April 2011. Under the completed 2001 plan, the company purchased a total of 42.0 million shares.

All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process.For further information relating to the change in cash provided by operating activities, see discussion above under cash provided by operating activities.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Long-term Employee BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.About 77 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S. the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plan's actuary as of the measurement date. For non-U.S. benefit plans, the company utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation over the long-term period 30Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plans' assets.In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)201320122011Market-related value of assets$15.5$14.8$13.9Fair value of plan assets16.115.113.9For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2013:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/2 PercentagePointIncrease1/2 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$89$94Expected rate of return on plan assets97(97)Additional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 34 and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental MattersDuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $458 million as of December 31, 2013; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to three times the amount accrued.Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Income TaxesThe breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant, however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.At December 31, 2013, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $6.4 billion, net of valuation allowance of $1.8 billion. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax asset balance.Valuation of AssetsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses. During 2013, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of $129 million to write-down the carrying value of an asset group to fair value. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to this charge.Based on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test in 2013, no impairments exist at this time. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. 32Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsCertain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.Contractual ObligationsInformation related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In(Dollars in millions)Total atDecember 31,201320142015 –20162017 –20182019 andbeyondLong-term debt obligations1$12,392$1,674$3,026$1,361$6,331Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity4,0474297766482,194Capital leases12636314Operating leases1,524288501388347Purchase obligations2 Information technology infrastructure & services174108624—Raw material obligations7405121406523Utility obligations29569983989INVISTA-related obligations31,533117282328806Human resource services6231301—Other2201535872Total purchase obligations3,024990670444920Other liabilities1,4 Workers' compensation9614431821Asset retirement obligations63210447Environmental remediation4588416867139Legal settlements8976544License agreements52,159326541572720Other619365291782Total other long-term liabilities3,0585677966821,013Total contractual obligations7$24,071$3,951$5,775$3,526$10,8191.

Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the estimate of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations. 33Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Long-term Employee BenefitsThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 77 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. In January 2012, the company contributed $500 million to its principal U.S. pension plan and no contributions were made in 2011 or 2013. No contributions are expected to be made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2014. The company expects to make contributions to its principal U.S. pension plan beyond 2014; however, the amount of any contributions is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows.Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $313 million to its pension plans in 2013 and anticipates that it will make approximately $344 million in contributions in 2014 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan.The company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $207 million, $261 million and $312 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $224 million in 2014. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.During the third quarter 2012, the company amended its U.S. parent company retiree medical and dental plans for Medicare-eligible pensioners and survivors. Beginning in 2013, the company replaced the coverage for Medicare-eligible plan participants in the company sponsored plans with a new company-funded Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA). Medicare-eligible plan participants enrolled in individual health plans in the open market and the company will reimburse their health care expenses with an HRA based on the provisions of the amended plans. As a result of this change, the company's other long-term employee benefit expense was reduced by approximately $120 million and $46 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. For 2014, the plan amendment is expected to reduce other long-term employee benefit expense by approximately $104 million. Additional information related to these changes in the plans noted above is included in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 34Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:(Dollars in millions)201320122011Long-term employee benefit plan charges 1$1,153$1,321$1,1341. The long-term employee benefit plan charges relating to discontinued operations was $5, $74 and $72 for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.The above charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2013 is primarily related to the retiree medical and dental plan amendment in 2012 and the Performance Coatings sale, partially offset by lower discount rates. See ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 30 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan.The company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2014, long-term employee benefits expense from continuing operations is expected to decrease by about $440 million due to higher discount rates at December 31, 2013 and better than expected pension asset returns during 2013.Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations are summarized below:(Dollars in millions)201320122011Environmental operating costs$602$595$562Increase in remediation accrual9011092 $692$705$654About 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2013 resulted from operations in the U.S. The increases in total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to operations were due primarily to increased environmental research activities and acquired businesses. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Environmental Operating CostsAs a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. 35Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Remediation AccrualChanges in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2011$416Remediation payments(90)Increase in remediation accrual110Balance at December 31, 2012$436Remediation payments(68)Increase in remediation accrual90Balance at December 31, 2013$458Annual expenditures are expected to continue to increase in the near future; however, they are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. As of December 31, 2013, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state laws at about 420 sites around the U.S., with active remediation under way at approximately 165 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 175 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at five new sites during 2013 compared with five and six similar notices in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2013. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company.Environmental Capital ExpendituresIn 2013, the company spent approximately $70 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $115 million in 2014. In the U.S., additional capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, management does not believe that the costs to comply with these requirements will have a material impact on the financial position or liquidity of the company. Climate ChangeThe company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2004, the company reduced its environmental footprint achieving in 2012 reductions of 25 percent in GHG emissions and 12 percent in water consumption versus our 2004 baselines. In addition, in 2012 the company achieved a one percent reduction in energy intensity from non-renewable resources versus a 2010 baseline. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. About $2 billion of the company's 2012 revenue was generated from sales of products that help direct and downstream customers reduce GHG emissions.The company is actively engaged in the effort to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities.Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. 36Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued At the national and regional level, there are existing efforts to address GHG emissions. Several of the company's facilities in the European Union (EU) are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. China has begun pilot programs for trading of GHG emissions in selected areas and South Korea will begin to implement its emission trading scheme in 2015. In the EU, U.S. and Japan, policy efforts to reduce the GHG emissions associated with gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning create market opportunities for lower GHG solutions. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S. adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. If in the absence of federal legislation, states were to implement programs mandating GHG emissions reductions, the company, its suppliers and customers could be competitively disadvantaged by the added costs of complying with a variety of state-specific requirements.In 2010, EPA launched a phased-in scheme to regulate GHG emissions first from large stationary sources under the existing Clean Air Act permitting requirements administered by state and local authorities. As a result, large capital investments may be required to install Best Available Control Technology on major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. This type of GHG emissions regulation by EPA, in the absence of or in addition to federal legislation, could result in more costly, less efficient facility-by-facility controls versus a federal program that incorporates policies that provide an economic balance that does not severely distort markets. Differences in regional or national legislation could present challenges in a global marketplace highlighting the need for coordinated global policy action. In 2013 EPA proposed more stringent regulations for new Electric Generating Units (EGU's) that may affect the long term price and supply of electricity. The precise impact is uncertain.PFOAThe Performance Chemicals segment used a form of PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) as a processing aid to manufacture some fluoropolymer resins. The Performance Materials segment used PFOA in the manufacture of certain raw materials for perfluoroelastomer parts (and some fluoroelastomers). In the fall of 2002, DuPont began producing rather than purchasing PFOA to support these manufacturing processes. PFOA is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. Significant scientific research has been and continues to be conducted to understand the exposure routes and potential hazards of PFOA. Regulatory agencies continue to review these studies to evaluate potential regulation. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to EPA's 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. DuPont has exceeded the EPA's 2010 objective. In February 2007, DuPont announced its commitment to no longer make, use or buy PFOA by 2015, or sooner if possible. As of the fourth quarter 2013, DuPont had already ceased the manufacture of PFOA and discontinued the use of PFOA for production of fluoropolymer resins as well as for raw materials used in the production of perfluoroelastomer parts and fluoroelastomers. In addition, the company continues to make progress in replacing fluorotelomer-based products with alternative products.For additional information regarding PFOA matters, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 37Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKDerivatives and Other Hedging InstrumentsIn the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes the impacts of the company's foreign currency hedging program on the company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, and includes the company's pro rata share of its equity affiliates' exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts:(Dollars in millions)201320122011Pre-tax exchange loss$(128)$(215)$(146)Tax benefit427381After-tax exchange loss$(86)$(142)$(65)In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Sensitivity AnalysisThe following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the market prices or rates that existed at December 31, 2013 and 2012. The sensitivity for interest rate swaps is based on a one percent change in the market interest rate. Foreign currency and commodity contracts sensitivities are based on a 10 percent change in market rates. Fair ValueAsset/(Liability)Fair ValueSensitivity(Dollars in millions)2013201220132012Interest rate swaps$29$55$(18)$(29)Foreign currency contracts189(1,000)(659)Commodity contracts(1)(1)(2)(3)Since the company's risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Concentration of Credit RiskThe company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. As of December 31, 2013, no one individual customer balance represented more than 5 percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. 38Part II",2023-12-30 21:52:08.851269

All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company's strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position, anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions, timing of anticipated benefits from restructuring actions, outcome of contingencies, such as litigation and environmental matters, expenditures and financial results, are forward-looking statements.Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be accurate or realized. Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. Some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are:•Fluctuations in energy and raw material prices;•Failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; •Outcome of significant litigation and environmental matters, including those related to divested businesses;•Failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues;•Effect of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations or political conditions in the United States of America (U.S.) and other countries in which the company operates;•Conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, including economic factors such as inflation, deflation, fluctuation in currency rates, interest rates and commodity prices;•Failure to appropriately respond to market acceptance, government rules, regulations and policies affecting products based on biotechnology;•Impact of business disruptions, including supply disruptions, and security threats, regardless of cause, including acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters;•Ability to discover, develop and protect new technologies and enforce the company's intellectual property rights; and•Successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-strategic assets or businesses, including the proposed spin-off of the Performance Chemicals segment. For some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements, see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 9.OverviewPurpose DuPont’s businesses serve markets where the increasing demand for more and healthier food, renewably sourced materials and fuels, and advanced industrial materials is creating substantial growth opportunities. The company’s unique combination of sciences, proven research and development (R&D) engine, broad global reach, and deep market penetration are distinctive competitive advantages that position the company to continue capitalizing on this enormous potential. Strategy Position DuPont as a higher growth, higher value company, well equipped to drive revenue and profit growth through science-based innovation and the company’s significant competitive advantages with three priorities:•Agriculture & Nutrition - extend DuPont’s leadership across the high-value, science-driven segments of the Agriculture and Food value chain;•Advanced Materials - strengthen and grow DuPont's leading position in differentiated, high-value materials and leverage new sciences;•Bio-Based Industrials - develop world-leading industrial biotechnology capabilities to create transformational new bio-based businesses. The company is committed to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth. 5Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults Income from continuing operations after income taxes was $3.6 billion, up 26 percent from $2.9 billion in 2013, reflecting higher segment PTOI, lower pension and OPEB costs, partly offset by Performance Chemicals separation transaction costs and restructuring charges. Net sales were $34.7 billion, a 3 percent decrease from prior year, reflecting portfolio changes and a negative impact from currency. Total segment PTOI was $6.4 billion, 18 percent above last year, principally due to gains on asset sales, insurance recoveries, lower performance-based compensation, and the absence of prior-year charges for litigation and product claims, partly offset by higher restructuring charges.Analysis of OperationsRedesign Initiative and 2014 Restructuring Plan In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to reduce costs and improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2014 a pre-tax charge of $562 million was recorded, consisting of $497 million in employee separation / asset related charges, net and $65 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $319 million of employee separation charges, $17 million of other non-personnel charges, and $226 million of asset related charges, including $65 million of charges associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The actions associated with this charge and all related payments are expected to be substantially complete by mid-2016 and will result in future cash payments at December 31, 2014 of $268 million primarily related to severance and related benefits. The company anticipates that it will incur future charges, which it cannot reasonably estimate at this time, related to this plan as it implements additional actions. Pre-tax cost savings related to this charge are expected to be about $500 million in 2015 and approximately $625 million in subsequent years. This, coupled with further cost savings initiatives and $375 million of costs directly associated with Chemours to be eliminated upon separation, are expected to yield savings on a run-rate basis of approximately $1 billion at the end of fourth quarter 2015 and $1.3 billion by 2017. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Separation of Performance Chemicals In October 2013, DuPont announced that it intends to separate its Performance Chemicals segment through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders, subject to customary closing conditions. In December 2014, the initial Form 10 registration statement related to the spin-off was filed with the SEC for the new public company to be created following completion of the pending separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. The new public company will be named The Chemours Company (Chemours). The company expects to complete the separation about mid-2015. As part of the separation, DuPont incurred $175 million in transaction costs, which were recorded in other operating charges in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2014. The company expects to incur additional costs related to the separation in 2015 estimated at about $350 million. These transaction costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, legal and information system functions. In addition, the company expects to return all or substantially all of the one-time dividend proceeds from Chemours to DuPont shareholders through share repurchases within the 12 to18 months following the separation of Chemours, with a portion returned in 2015. As a result of the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment, coupled with the company’s redesign initiative, the functional currency at certain of the company’s foreign entities is being re-evaluated and, in some cases, will result in a change in the foreign entities’ functional currency. The re-evaluation will not impact the company's results of operations on the date of the change.Divestiture of Performance Coatings In August 2012, the company entered into a definitive agreement with Flash Bermuda Co. Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company formed by affiliates of The Carlyle Group (collectively referred to as ""Carlyle"") in which Carlyle agreed to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the company's Performance Coatings business. In February 2013, the sale was completed resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax). The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2013.In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), the results of Performance Coatings are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.

Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).Net sales of $34.7 billion were 3 percent below prior year including a 2 percent reduction from portfolio changes, primarily due to changes within the Performance Chemicals and Performance Materials segments and 1 percent negative currency impact. The negative currency impact was driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. Local prices were 1 percent lower principally due to lower prices in the Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications segments, the latter reflecting lower metals prices. Agriculture local prices were up 1 percent. Sales in developing markets of $11.8 billion were essentially flat versus prior year and represent 34 percent of total company sales versus 33 percent in 2013. Developing markets include China, India and countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia.2013 versus 2012 The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2013 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from 2012: Percent Change Due to:(Dollars in billions)2013Net SalesPercentChange vs.2012LocalPriceCurrencyEffectVolumePortfolio / OtherWorldwide$35.73(1)(1)5—U.S. & Canada14.841—3—EMEA18.44(2)141Asia Pacific7.7(3)(6)(3)6—Latin America4.86—(3)9—1. Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).Net sales increased 3 percent, reflecting a 5 percent increase in worldwide sales volume with growth in all segments. Local prices were 1 percent lower principally due to a 12 percent decline in Performance Chemicals prices and a pass through of lower precious metals prices for Electronics & Communications. Negative currency impact reflects a weaker Brazilian real and Indian rupee, partly offset by a stronger Euro. Sales in developing markets of $11.9 billion improved 7 percent on 10 percent higher volume, and the percentage of total company sales in these markets increased to 33 percent from 32 percent in 2012.(Dollars in millions)201420132012OTHER INCOME, NET$1,323$410$4982014 versus 2013 The $913 million increase was primarily due to $749 million of gains on sales of businesses and other assets, including a $391 million gain on the sale of GLS/Vinyls which is recorded within the Performance Materials segment, and a $240 million gain on the sale of copper fungicides and land management businesses, both within the Agriculture segment. There were additional net pre-tax exchange gains of $263 million, partially offset by $65 million for charges associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment and the absence of the $26 million re-measurement gain on equity method investment in 2013. Net pre-tax exchange gains for the year ended December 31, 2014, includes $58 million, $46 million, and $14 million in exchange losses, associated with the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, Ukrainian hryvnia, and Argentinian peso, respectively. Net pre-tax exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes $33 million exchange losses associated with the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar.2013 versus 2012 The $88 million decrease was largely attributable to the absence of a $122 million gain related to the 2012 sale of the company's interest in an equity method investment, the absence of a $117 million gain related to the 2012 sale of a business within the Agriculture segment, partially offset by $87 million lower net pre-tax exchange losses, $27 million increase in interest income, and a $26 million re-measurement gain on an equity investment.Additional information related to the company's other income, net is included in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(Dollars in millions)201420132012COST OF GOODS SOLD$21,703$22,547$21,400As a percent of net sales63%63%61%2014 versus 2013 Cost of goods sold (COGS) decreased 4 percent to $21.7 billion principally due to portfolio refinements and a 1 percent decrease in product unit costs driven by lower metals and other raw material costs, partially offset with a 1 percent increase in sales volume.2013 versus 2012 COGS increased 5 percent to $22.5 billion, with 4 percent driven by higher sales volume and 1 percent driven by higher product costs. COGS as a percentage of net sales was 63 percent, a 2 percent increase from 2012. The increase in COGS as a percentage of net sales principally reflects the impact of increased costs for raw materials and agriculture inputs versus lower selling prices, coupled with adverse currency impact. (Dollars in millions)201420132012OTHER OPERATING CHARGES$1,067$1,560$1,856As a percent of net sales3%4%5% The company’s cost structure has been impacted by the global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. Effective December 31, 2014, in order to better align to the transforming company’s organization and resulting cost structure, certain costs were reclassified from other operating charges to selling, general and administrative expenses. Prior year data has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.2014 versus 2013 Other operating charges decreased $493 million percent to $1.1 billion, principally due to the absence of prior year charges for Imprelis® herbicide claims and titanium dioxide antitrust litigation and an increase in insurance recoveries. Decreases in other operating charges were partially offset with costs associated with the separation of the Performance Chemicals segment of $175 million. 2013 versus 2012 Other operating charges decreased $296 million to $1.6 billion, principally due to lower Imprelis® herbicide claims, net of insurance recoveries, and the absence of other litigation charges, partially offset with charges for titanium dioxide antitrust litigation.See Note 2 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the Perfomance Chemicals transaction costs and the Imprelis® matter, respectively.(Dollars in millions)201420132012SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES$5,344$5,833$5,886As a percent of net sales15%16%17%2014 versus 2013 The $489 million decrease was largely attributable to lower pension and OPEB costs and lower sales commissions within the Agriculture segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to lower pension and OPEB costs. 2013 versus 2012 Selling, general and administrative expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to savings from prior years restructuring program.(Dollars in millions)201420132012RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE$2,067$2,153$2,123As a percent of net sales6%6%6%2014 versus 2013 The $86 million decrease was primarily attributable to lower pension and OPEB costs and lower spending for Agriculture and Electronic & Communications programs. 2013 versus 2012 The $30 million increase was primarily attributable to continued growth investments in the Agriculture segment and increases in pre-commercial investment.(Dollars in millions)201420132012INTEREST EXPENSE$377$448$464The $71 million and $16 million decreases in 2014 and 2013, respectively,were due to lower average borrowings as average interest rates were essentially unchanged in each year. (Dollars in millions)201420132012EMPLOYEE SEPARATION/ASSET RELATED CHARGES, NET$497$114$493The $497 million in charges recorded during 2014 in employee separation / asset related charges, net are related to the 2014 restructuring plan discussed below.In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2014 a pre-tax charge of $562 million was recorded, consisting of $497 million in employee separation / asset related charges, net and $65 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $319 million employee separation costs, $17 million of other non-personnel costs, and $226 million of asset related costs, including $65 million of costs associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The actions associated with this charge and all related payments are expected to be substantially complete by mid-2016 and will result in future cash payments at December 31, 2014 of approximately $268 million primarily related to severance and related benefits. The actions related to this plan achieved pre-tax cost savings of approximately $80 million in 2014. The $114 million in charges recorded during 2013 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consisted of a net $15 million restructuring benefit and a $129 million asset impairment charge discussed below. The net $15 million restructuring benefit consisted of a $24 million benefit associated with prior year restructuring programs offset by a $9 million charge resulting from restructuring actions related to a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The majority of the $24 million benefit was due to the achievement of work force reductions through non-severance programs associated with the 2012 restructuring program.The $493 million in charges recorded during 2012 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consisted of $234 million in charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, a $16 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with prior years restructuring programs, and $275 million in asset impairment charges, as discussed below. The actions related to this plan achieved pre-tax cost savings of more than $300 million in 2013 and $490 million in 2014.Asset ImpairmentsDuring 2013, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of $129 million to write-down the carrying value of an asset group, within the Electronics & Communications segment, to fair value.During 2012, the company recorded asset impairment charges of $275 million to write-down the carrying value of certain asset groups to fair value. These asset impairment charges resulted in a $150 million charge within the Electronics & Communications segment, a $92 million charge within the Performance Materials segment and a $33 million charge within the Performance Chemicals segment.Additional details related to the restructuring programs and asset impairments discussed above can be found in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Below is a summary of the net impact related to items recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net: (Dollars in millions)2014 (Charges) and Credits2013 (Charges) and Credits2012 (Charges) and CreditsAgriculture$(134)$1$(11)Electronics & Communications(84)(131)(159)Industrial Biosciences(13)1(3)Nutrition & Health(15)6(49)Performance Chemicals(21)(2)(36)Performance Materials(34)(6)(104)Safety & Protection(52)4(58)Other(22)511Corporate expenses(122)8(84)Total Charges$(497)$(114)$(493)(Dollars in millions)201420132012PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS$1,370$626$616Effective income tax rate27.4%17.9%19.9%In 2014, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $1.4 billion, reflecting a $0.7 billion increase from 2013, largely due to the impact associated with the company’s policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations in addition to the impact of gains on sales of businesses and other assets in the Performance Materials and Agriculture segments. The higher effective tax rate principally reflects the impact of foreign exchange losses on net monetary assets for which no corresponding tax benefit is realized, in addition to the impact of the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation which is also nondeductible. In 2013, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $626 million, reflecting a marginal increase from 2012. The decrease in the 2013 effective tax rate compared to 2012 was primarily due to geographic mix of earnings, in addition to benefits associated with certain U.S. business tax provisions in 2013. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations, as well as items that significantly impact the company's effective income tax rate.(Dollars in millions)201420132012INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES$3,621$2,863$2,472Income from continuing operations after income taxes for 2014 was $3.6 billion compared to $2.9 billion in 2013 and $2.5 billion in 2012. The changes between periods were due to the reasons noted above.Corporate OutlookThe company expects 2015 net sales and income will reflect negative currency impact due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The currency impact is expected to be most significant in the first half of the year due to the seasonality of Agriculture in the northern hemisphere. The company also expects to achieve savings from the operational redesign. The 2015 outlook does not reflect the planned separation of the Performance Chemicals segment or the impact of the expected return of capital related to the separation.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. Segment ReviewsSegment sales include transfers to another business segment. Products are transferred between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the market value of the products. Segment PTOI is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes excluding non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. Viton® fluoroeastomer products (Viton®) will be included in the Performance Chemicals separation and therefore the results are reported within Performance Chemicals. Viton® was previously reported within Performance Materials. Reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year classifications. All references to prices are on a U.S. dollar (USD) basis, including the impact of currency, unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated net sales and segment PTOI to income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2014, 2013 and 2012 is included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment PTOI and PTOI margins include certain items which management believes are significant to understanding the segment results discussed below. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to these items.AGRICULTURE(Dollars in millions)201420132012Segment sales$11,304$11,739$10,426PTOI$2,668$2,132$1,669PTOI margin24%18%16% 20142013Change in segment sales from prior period due to: Price(1)%5%Volume(3)%7%Portfolio / Other— %1%Total change(4)%13%2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment sales of $11.3 billion decreased $0.4 billion, or 4 percent, primarily due to lower corn seed volumes in Brazil and North America and the negative impact of currency, which was partly offset by an increase in crop protection volumes and higher local corn seed prices. In Brazil, corn seed market share and price were lower reflecting the impact of fall armyworm resistance and a reduction in planted hectares of corn. Higher volumes in insecticides were driven by continued growth in Rynaxypyr® and from successful launches of Cyazypyr® and new seed treatments in several markets. 2014 PTOI and PTOI margin increased due to the absence of $425 million of charges incurred in 2013 related to Imprelis® herbicide claims, an increase of $137 million for insurance recoveries of costs related to these customer claims, a gain of $240 million associated with the sale of the copper fungicides and land management businesses, lower performance-based compensation expense of approximately $110 million and lower seed input costs. This was partly offset by a decrease in sales, net change in restructuring charges of $135 million and impacts from portfolio changes. See Notes 3 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the company's 2014 restructuring program and the Imprelis® matter, respectively. 2013 versus 2012 Sales growth was principally driven by higher global seed prices and volumes, increased global insecticide and fungicide volumes, and the benefit of increased ownership in Pannar Seed (Pty) Ltd, slightly offset by negative currency. Growth in seeds reflects strong corn sales in North America and Brazil. Increased insecticide volumes were driven by demand for Rynaxypyr®, particularly in Latin America to combat heavy insect pressure, while fungicide volume increases were led by demand for picoxytstrobin in North America and Latin America.2013 PTOI and PTOI margin increased on sales growth, lower charges incurred related to Imprelis® herbicide claims, and earlier seed shipments, partially offset by higher seed input costs of about $350 million, $108 million of negative currency impact, and the absence of a $117 million gain on the sale of a business recorded in 2012. As a result of the earlier timing of seed shipments, representing earlier seed shipments for the Brazil safrinha corn season enabled by recent investments and earlier direct seed shipments to North American farmers, approximately $100 million of PTOI was realized in 2013 versus 2014. 2013 PTOI included net charges of $352 million ($425 million in charges offset by $73 million of insurance recoveries) related to Imprelis® herbicide claims compared to charges of $575 million in 2012. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the Imprelis® matter. Outlook Farmer net income has declined and growers in Brazil’s Safrinha season and in North America are likely to reduce corn plantings again in 2015 putting pressure on volumes in the first half of the year. In addition, crop protection volumes are expected to be impacted by lower insect pressure in Brazil and elevated distributor inventories in the Americas.For the first half 2015 sales are expected to be in the mid-single digits percent lower and PTOI is expected to be approximately 10 percent below 2014. The company expects pricing gains to be more than offset by lower volumes and continued volatile currencies, which are anticipated to be significant in markets like Europe, Brazil and Canada where there has been strong growth in the company's market position in recent years. Volumes will be negatively impacted by the expected decline in North America and Brazil Safrinha corn area and the timing of seed shipments in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year we expect a decrease in sales in the low-single digits percent and a decrease in PTOI in the high-single digits percent as price gains from new seed and crop protection products are more than offset by the negative impacts of currency. Excluding the impact of currency, we would expect PTOI to be up in the mid- to high-single digits.ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATIONS(Dollars in millions)201420132012Segment sales$2,393$2,549$2,701PTOI$271$203$222PTOI margin11%8%8% 20142013Change in segment sales from prior period due to: Price(8)%(8)%Volume2 %2 %Portfolio / Other— %— %Total change(6)%(6)%2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment sales of $2.4 billion decreased $0.2 billion, or 6 percent, as volume growth in several product lines was more than offset by pass-through of lower metals prices and by competitive pressures impacting Solamet® paste. 2014 PTOI and PTOI margin increased due to the absence of a $129 million asset impairment charge incurred in 2013 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), volume growth and productivity gains. These were partly offset by the absence of $20 million of OLED technology licensing agreement realized during 2013 and a net change in restructuring charges of $82 million (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the 2014 restructuring program).2013 versus 2012 Sales declined as share gains and improving photovoltaics demand, offset in part by lower usage of materials per photovoltaic module, were more than offset by lower price. The decline in price largely reflects pass-through of lower metals prices.2013 PTOI declined as the absence of a $122 million gain related to the sale of an equity method investment recorded in 2012 more than offset volume gains, improved plant utilization, and $20 million of income from an OLED technology licensing agreement realized during 2013. In addition, 2013 PTOI includes a $129 million asset impairment charge compared to a $150 million asset impairment charge recorded in 2012 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).Outlook Full year sales are expected to be up in the low-single digits percent with volume gains offset by the pass-through of lower metals prices. PTOI is expected to be up in the high-teens percent driven by increases in volume, productivity benefits, and the anticipated impact of new photovoltaic paste products in the second half of the year. Global photovoltaic module installations are expected to increase fueled by installations in China, Japan, the U.S. and in developing markets. Continued strength in Tedlar® film, consumer electronics and packaging graphics is anticipated. In the short-term, segment results are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by declines in Solamet® paste, as intense competition has impacted price and share in this business. The company expects to benefit from new photovoltaic paste products in the second half of the year.INDUSTRIAL BIOSCIENCES(Dollars in millions)201420132012Segment sales$1,258$1,224$1,180PTOI$198$170$159PTOI margin16%14%13% 20142013Change in segment sales from prior period due to: Price1%2%Volume2%2%Portfolio / Other—%—%Total change3%4%2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment sales of $1.3 billion increased $0.03 billion, or 3 percent, on increased enzyme demand, principally for ethanol production, food and animal nutrition, driven by new product offerings. Ethanol industry fundamentals are adjusting to a lower energy cost environment but demand for the company's novel enzymes and other functional bio products designed to increase production rates, yield and efficiency remained steady. 2014 PTOI and PTOI margin increased from higher volumes and improved product mix, which were partially offset by a net change in restructuring charges of $14 million (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the 2014 restructuring program).2013 versus 2012 The sales increase represents higher prices and demand for Sorona® polymer for carpeting and increased demand for enzymes for food, partially offset by lower enzyme demand for U.S. ethanol production.2013 PTOI and PTOI margin increased slightly reflecting pricing gains and increased demand for Sorona® polymer for carpeting. Outlook For 2015 sales are expected to be flat, with volume growth offset by a negative currency impact. PTOI is expected to be up in the high teens on a percentage basis driven by higher volumes and stronger product mix.

Restructuring charges of $15 million were incurred in 2014 compared to $6 million in 2013 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the 2014 restructuring program).2013 versus 2012 Sales were up reflecting global pricing gains and increased demand in specialty proteins, probiotics, and cultures, partially offset by the impact of manufacturing site closures in fourth quarter 2012, lower volume in enablers, and negative currency impact.2013 PTOI and PTOI margin increased as favorable mix, productivity improvements, and the absence of $49 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2012 more than offset higher cost guar inventory.Outlook Full year sales are expected to be about flat with broad-based volume gains offset by currency. Full year PTOI is expected to be mid-single digits percent higher benefiting from lower raw material costs, improved mix and a continued focus on productivity, further expanding margins, which will be partly offset by negative impact from currency.PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS(Dollars in millions)201420132012Segment sales$6,497$6,932$7,450PTOI$913$941$1,826PTOI margin14%14%25% 20142013Change in segment sales from prior period due to: Price(4)%(12)%Volume2 %5 %Portfolio / Other(4)%— %Total change(6)%(7)%2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment sales of $6.5 billion decreased $0.4 billion, or 6 percent, due primarily to a portfolio change in industrial chemicals and lower prices principally for titanium dioxide, refrigerants and fluoroproducts. The portfolio change involved a customer’s election to exercise a buy-out option of a supply contract and related aniline facility at the end of 2013. Partially offsetting the declines were volume increases primarily for titanium dioxide, refrigerants and fluoroproducts.2014 PTOI declined and PTOI margin was flat, due primarily to lower prices, the above mentioned portfolio changes and an increase in restructuring charges of $19 million (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the 2014 restructuring program). This was partially offset by improved volumes, the absence of a $72 million charge incurred in 2013 related to titanium dioxide antitrust litigation, lower performance-based compensation expense of approximately $30 million and a $23 million gain from the sale of a business. 2013 versus 2012 The change in sales due to price was driven principally by price declines for titanium dioxide in all regions, coupled with lower prices for fluoropolymers and refrigerants. Volume growth reflects increased demand for titanium dioxide, which was up 14 percent from 2012.2013 PTOI and PTOI margin decreased principally on lower selling prices. Volume gains were offset by higher raw material inventory costs, mainly ore costs. 2013 PTOI includes a $72 million charge related to titanium dioxide antitrust litigation, while 2012 PTOI included a $33 million asset impairment charge (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).Outlook Full year 2015, segment volumes are expected to grow with global gross domestic product with full year sales up low-single digits on a percent basis. Full year PTOI is expected to be about flat as higher volumes are offset by the negative impact of currency and portfolio changes.PERFORMANCE MATERIALS(Dollars in millions)201420132012Segment sales$6,129$6,239$6,185PTOI$1,590$1,264$1,073PTOI margin26%20%17% 20142013Change in segment sales from prior period due to: Price— %(3)%Volume2 %5 %Portfolio / Other(4)%(1)%Total change(2)%1 %2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment sales of $6.1 billion decreased $0.1 billion, or 2 percent, due primarily to the impact of the sale of GLS/Vinyls (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and decreased ethylene volumes as a result of the second quarter scheduled outage at the Orange, Texas ethylene unit. This was partially offset by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China, Europe and North America. 2014 PTOI and PTOI margin increased, due primarily to a $391 million pre-tax gain on the sale of GLS/Vinyls, partially offset by the impact of portfolio changes. Restructuring charges of $99 million were incurred in 2014 compared to $16 million in 2013 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the 2014 restructuring program).2013 versus 2012 Sales were essentially flat as increased demand in packaging and automotive markets was mostly offset by lower selling prices.2013 PTOI and PTOI margin increased as lower feedstock costs, higher volumes, and the absence of a $92 million asset impairment charge recorded in 2012 (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) more than offset lower selling prices and negative currency impact.Outlook Full year 2015 segment sales are expected to decrease in the mid-single digits on a percent basis, as increased volumes are expected to be offset by decreases due to portfolio changes, local price decreases and a negative impact of currency.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Liquidity & Capital Resources December 31,(Dollars in millions)20142013Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$7,034$9,086Total debt10,69412,462Pursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. The company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt maturities and other cash needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. The company's current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings provide excellent access to the capital markets. The company has access to approximately $4.9 billion in unused credit lines with several major financial institutions which provide additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes including letters of credit. The amount of unused credit lines increased $0.5 billion from December 31, 2013, primarily due to refinancing of the company's credit facility with an expansion to a five year $4.0 billion credit facility during 2014.The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are $7.0 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 include the proceeds received from the sale of the Performance Coatings business. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. of $4.5 billion and $3.9 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are generally utilized to fund local operating activities and capital expenditure requirements and are expected to support non-U.S. liquidity needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The company expects domestic liquidity needs, for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter, will be met through existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. and other funding sources, including cash generated from U.S. operations, asset sales, the ability to access the capital markets, and the company's credit lines. Therefore, the company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic liquidity to support its assumption that undistributed earnings at December 31, 2014 can be considered reinvested indefinitely. The company continually reviews its debt portfolio and occasionally may rebalance it to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum debt maturity schedule. In 2013, the company issued $1,250 million of 2.80% Notes due February 15, 2023 and $750 million of 4.15% Notes due February 15, 2043. The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows: Long-termShort-termOutlookStandard & Poor'sAA-1NegativeMoody’s Investors ServiceA2P-1Under review for possible downgradeFitch RatingsAF1Stable(Dollars in millions)201420132012Cash provided by operating activities$3,712$3,179$4,849Cash provided by operating activities increased $0.5 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower year over year income tax payments associated with the sale of businesses and higher insurance recoveries and lower claims payments related to Imprelis® (See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). 8Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.7 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower cash from earnings and higher working capital in the Agriculture segment. Lower earnings were driven by the absence of 11 months of results from the Performance Coatings business as well as a decline in the Performance Chemicals segment. Higher working capital in the Agriculture segment was a result of higher trade receivables due to an increase in sales in the fourth quarter 2013 as well as an increase in customer credit sales in Latin America. In addition the Agriculture segment's working capital was negatively impacted in 2013 as a result of timing differences in when customer prepayments for the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons were collected.(Dollars in millions)201420132012Cash (used by) provided by investing activities$(337)$2,945$(1,346)Cash used by investing activities in 2014 decreased $3.3 billion compared to 2013.

The change was primarily due to the proceeds received from the sale of the Performance Coatings business. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The company expects 2015 purchases of property, plant and equipment to about $1.8 billion.(Dollars in millions)201420132012Cash used for financing activities$(5,074)$(1,474)$(2,697)The $3.6 billion increase in cash used for financing activities in 2014 was primarily due to lower borrowings and higher payments for the repurchase of common stock.The $1.2 billion decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2013 was due primarily to higher borrowings and lower payments for noncontrolling interests, partially offset by higher repurchases of common stock. Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.7 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.84, $1.78, and $1.70 in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. With the first quarter 2015 dividend, the company has paid quarterly consecutive dividends since the company’s first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904.In January 2014, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan that replaced the 2011 plan. In February and August 2014, the company entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. The February 2014 ASR agreement was completed in the second quarter of 2014, under which the company purchased and retired 15.1 million shares for $1 billion. The August 2014 ASR agreement was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, under which the company purchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $700 million. In addition to the ASR agreements, in 2014, the company repurchased and retired 4.7 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $300 million. As a result, the company has completed $2 billion of repurchases as of December 31, 2014. The remainder of the $5 billion share buyback will be purchased in future periods as there is no required completion date for purchases under the 2014 plan. See Part I, Item 5 Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In December 2012, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share buyback plan. In February 2013, the company entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution under which the company used $1 billion of the proceeds from the sale of Performance Coatings for the purchase of shares of common stock. The 2012 $1 billion share buyback plan was completed in the second quarter 2013 through the ASR agreement, under which the company purchased and retired 20.4 million shares. 9Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued During 2012, the company purchased and retired 7.8 million shares at a total cost of $400 million. These purchases completed the 2001 $2 billion share buyback plan and began purchases under a $2 billion share buyback plan authorized by the company's Board of Directors in April 2011. Under the completed 2001 plan, the company purchased a total of 42.0 million shares. Under the 2011 plan, the company has purchased 5.5 million shares at a total cost of $284 million as of December 31, 2013. See Note 16 Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the above share buyback plans.(Dollars in millions)201420132012Cash provided by operating activities$3,712$3,179$4,849Purchases of property, plant and equipment(2,020)(1,882)(1,793)Free cash flow$1,692$1,297$3,056Free cash flow is a measurement not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process.For further information relating to the change in cash provided by operating activities, see discussion above under cash provided by operating activities.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Long-term Employee BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.About 79 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S. the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plan's actuary as of the measurement date. For non-U.S. benefit plans, the company utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plans' assets.In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)201420132012Market-related value of assets$15.9$15.5$14.8Fair value of plan assets15.816.115.1For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2014:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/2 PercentagePointIncrease1/2 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$112$(119)Expected rate of return on plan assets100(100)In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries released final reports of new mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale for measurement of retirement program obligations in the U.S. The company has adopted these tables in measuring the 2014 long-term employee benefit obligations. This adoption has increased the benefit obligation at December 31, 2014 by approximately $1.7 billion. The effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2015 as disclosed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Additional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 39 and in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental MattersDuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $478 million as of December 31, 2014; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.1 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2014.Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Income TaxesThe breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that net reductions to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be in the range of $100 million to $125 million within the next 12 months with the majority due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.At December 31, 2014, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $7.5 billion, net of valuation allowance of $1.8 billion. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax asset balance.Valuation of AssetsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.Based on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test, completed in the third quarter 2014, we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsCertain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The company’s remaining pension plans with no plan assets and other long-term employee benefits plans are paid from operating cash flows. The benefit payments for these plans are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of benefit payments are uncertain.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Long-term Employee BenefitsThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 79 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. No contributions were made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2014 and the company expects to contribute less than $50 million in 2015. Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $190 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan in 2014.U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $121 million to its unfunded plans in 2014.The company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $233 million, $207 million and $261 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.In 2015, the company expects to contribute about the same as 2014 for pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, its remaining plans with no plan assets and its other long-term employee benefit plans.The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:(Dollars in millions)201420132012Long-term employee benefit plan charges 1$715$1,153$1,3211. The long-term employee benefit plan charges relating to discontinued operations were $0, $5 and $74 for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.The above charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2014 is primarily related to higher discount rates and better than expected pension asset returns. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2013 is primarily related to the retiree medical and dental plan amendment in 2012 and the Performance Coatings sale, partially offset by lower discount rates. See ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 34 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan. 11Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2015, long-term employee benefits expense from continuing operations is expected to increase by about $190 million due to lower discount rates and the adoption of the new mortality tables in the U.S. at December 31, 2014 (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to the adoption of the new mortality tables).Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations are summarized below:(Dollars in millions)201420132012Environmental operating costs$605$602$595Increase in remediation accrual9590110 $700$692$705About 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2014 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Environmental Operating CostsAs a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. Remediation AccrualChanges in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2012$436Remediation payments(68)Increase in remediation accrual90Balance at December 31, 2013$458Remediation payments(75)Increase in remediation accrual95Balance at December 31, 2014$478Annual expenditures are expected to continue to increase in the near future; however, they are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. 12Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued As of December 31, 2014, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 100 sites for which DuPont does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 140 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 190 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at three new sites during 2014 compared with five similar notices in both 2013 and 2012. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.1 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2014. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company.Environmental Capital ExpendituresIn 2014, the company spent approximately $84 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be about $75 million in 2015. In the U.S., additional capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, management does not believe that the costs to comply with these requirements will have a material impact on the financial position or liquidity of the company. Climate ChangeThe company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2004, the company reduced its environmental footprint, achieving in 2013 reductions of 19 percent in GHG emissions and 18 percent in water consumption versus our 2004 baselines. In addition, in 2013 the company achieved a 4 percent reduction in energy intensity from non-renewable resources versus a 2010 baseline. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. About $2.5 billion of the company's 2013 revenue was generated from sales of products that help direct and downstream customers improve energy efficiency and/or reduce GHG emissions.The company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate.There are existing efforts to address GHG emissions at the national and regional levels. Several of the company's facilities in the European Union (EU) are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. China has begun pilot programs for carbon taxes and trading of GHG emissions in selected areas. In the EU, U.S. and Japan, policy efforts to reduce the GHG emissions associated with gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning create market opportunities for lower GHG solutions. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many company facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. 13Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a phased-in scheme to regulate GHG emissions first from large stationary sources under the existing CAA permitting requirements administered by state and local authorities. Large capital investments may be required to install Best Available Control Technology on major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. In 2014, the EPA proposed regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from new Electric Generating Units (EGU's). In 2014, the EPA also proposed new regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from existing and reconstructed/modified EGUs that would be based on individual state emission reduction programs. When finalized in 2015, these rules may affect the long term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for products that contribute to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The precise impact of the proposed regulations is uncertain due to the flexibility provided to the states in developing their programs and anticipated legal challenges to this regulatory approach. A comprehensive national policy that addresses climate change by relying on market-based mechanisms to drive reductions in greenhouse gases is likely to be more economically efficient than the facility-by-facility controls that would result from implementation of current proposed rules under EPA’s existing authorities. At the international level, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace, highlighting the need for coordinated global policy actions. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets. PFOAThe Performance Chemicals segment used a form of PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) as a processing aid to manufacture some fluoropolymer resins. The Performance Materials segment used PFOA in the manufacture of certain raw materials for perfluoroelastomer parts (and some fluoroelastomers). In the fall of 2002, DuPont began producing rather than purchasing PFOA to support these manufacturing processes. PFOA is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. Significant scientific research has been and continues to be conducted to understand the exposure routes and potential hazards of PFOA. Regulatory agencies continue to review these studies to evaluate potential regulation. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to EPA's 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. As of the fourth quarter 2013, DuPont had already ceased the manufacture of PFOA and discontinued the use of PFOA for production of fluoropolymer resins as well as for raw materials used in the production of perfluoroelastomer parts and fluoroelastomers. In addition, as of the fourth quarter 2014, the company completed replacement of fluorotelomer-based products with alternative products.DuPont has met its commitment to the EPA 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. Also, DuPont has met its 2007 commitment to no longer make, use or buy PFOA by 2015.For additional information regarding PFOA matters, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Derivatives and Other Hedging InstrumentsIn the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes the impacts of the company's foreign currency hedging program on the company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, and includes the company's pro rata share of its equity affiliates' exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts:(Dollars in millions)201420132012Pre-tax exchange gain (loss)$135$(128)$(215)Tax (expense) benefit(416)4273After-tax exchange loss$(281)$(86)$(142)In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Sensitivity AnalysisThe following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the market prices or rates that existed at December 31, 2014 and 2013. The sensitivity for interest rate swaps is based on a one percent change in the market interest rate. Foreign currency and commodity contracts sensitivities are based on a 10 percent change in market rates.

Concentration of Credit RiskThe company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. As of December 31, 2014, no one individual customer balance represented more than five percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. 14Part II",2023-12-30 21:52:07.367702

Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. Some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements are:•Risks related to the agreement between DuPont and Dow to effect an all-stock merger of equals, including the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, the ability to fully and timely realize the expected benefits of the proposed transaction and risks related to the intended business separations contemplated to occur after the completion of the proposed transaction;•Volatility in energy and raw material prices;•Failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; •Outcome of significant litigation and environmental matters, including those related to divested businesses, including realization of associated indemnification assets, if any;•Failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues;•Ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for its products especially in the Agriculture segment;•Failure to realize all of the expected benefits from cost and productivity initiatives to the extent and as anticipated;•Effect of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations or political conditions in the United States of America (U.S.) and other countries in which the company operates;•Conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, including economic factors such as inflation, deflation, fluctuation in currency rates, interest rates and commodity prices;•Failure to appropriately respond to market acceptance, government rules, regulations and policies affecting products based on biotechnology;•Impact of business disruptions, including supply disruptions, and security threats, regardless of cause, including acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, terrorism or war, natural disasters and weather events and patterns which could affect demand as well as availability of product, particularly in the Agriculture segment;•Ability to discover, develop and protect new technologies and enforce the company's intellectual property rights; and•Successful integration of acquired businesses and separation of underperforming or non-strategic assets or businesses. For some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements, see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 10.Overview DuPont Dow Merger of Equals On December 11, 2015, DuPont and Dow announced entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals. The merger transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approvals by both DuPont and Dow shareholders. The combined company will be named DowDuPont. DuPont and Dow intend to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the board of directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company’s agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through a series of one or more tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the Business Separations.) In connection with the planned merger, the company incurred $10 million in transaction related costs, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2015. 22Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSee the discussion entitled Dow DuPont Merger of Equals under Part 1, Item 1 Business of this report, Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details and a discussion of some of the risks related to the transaction.Purpose DuPont’s businesses serve markets where the increasing demand for more and healthier food, renewably sourced materials and fuels, and advanced industrial materials is creating substantial growth opportunities. The company’s unique combination of sciences, proven research and development (R&D) engine, broad global reach, and deep market penetration are distinctive competitive advantages that position the company to continue capitalizing on this enormous potential. Strategy DuPont’s near term focus is to deliver earnings growth while positioning the businesses to compete successfully over the long term; continue to improve capital allocation and working capital performance; and complete the proposed merger of equals with Dow.DuPont has dramatically refined its portfolio to focus investment in areas of significant opportunity and secular growth; enhanced its innovation platform to deliver substantial revenues from new products; increased focus on efficiency, cost discipline, and accountability; and expanded markets geographically. The company is better connecting its laboratories and the marketplace, and striving for faster, more effective execution in delivering innovative solutions for customers. The goal is to increase agility and responsiveness to market conditions, a necessity to win in a globally competitive environment, and drive growth across three strategic priorities: extending leadership in agriculture and nutrition, strengthening and growing advanced materials capabilities, and leveraging science to develop a world leading bio-based industrial business.The company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth. Results Net sales of $25.1 billion, were down 12 percent versus prior year, principally reflecting 7 percent negative impact from currency, 3 percent lower volume and 2 percent negative impact from portfolio changes. Income from continuing operations after income taxes declined from $3.1 billion to $1.9 billion, reflecting lower segment operating earnings, the absence of prior year gains on businesses and other assets, and higher restructuring charges, partially offset by costs savings associated with the 2014 redesign initiative and restructuring plan. Total pre-tax segment operating earnings of $4.2 billion, were 16 percent below last year, principally due to the negative impact of currency of about $785 million and lower volumes driven by weakness in agriculture markets, partially offset by costs savings associated with the 2014 operational redesign initiative and restructuring plan.Analysis of Operations 2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs in 2016 compared with 2015, which represents a reduction of operating costs on a run-rate basis of about $1.0 billion by end of 2016. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of $798 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $656 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs. Future cash expenditures related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $680 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits. The restructuring actions associated with this charge are expected to impact approximately 10 percent of DuPont’s workforce and to be substantially complete in 2016. The company anticipates additional charges could occur in relation to the restructuring actions, which it cannot reasonably estimate at this time. 23Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Redesign Initiative and 2014 Restructuring Plan In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to reduce costs and improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 pre-tax (benefits) charges of $(21) million and $541 million, respectively, were recorded. Cost reductions from the 2014 operational redesign are essentially complete and for full year 2015, the company delivered incremental cost savings of approximately $0.40 per share year over year. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Separation of Performance Chemicals In October 2013, DuPont announced its intention to separate its Performance Chemicals segment through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders, subject to customary closing conditions. In July 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (Chemours).Divestiture of Performance Coatings In August 2012, the company entered into a definitive agreement with Flash Bermuda Co. Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company formed by affiliates of The Carlyle Group (collectively referred to as ""Carlyle"") in which Carlyle agreed to purchase certain subsidiaries and assets comprising the company's Performance Coatings business. In February 2013, the sale was completed resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.7 billion ($2.0 billion net of tax). The gain was recorded in income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2013. 24Part IIITEM 7.

Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).Net sales of $25.1 billion were down 12 percent versus prior year reflecting a 7 percent negative impact from weaker currencies, particularly the Brazilian Real and the European Euro, 3 percent lower volume and a 2 percent negative impact from the absence of sales from divested businesses. Lower volume principally reflects a 6 percent decline in Agriculture that was primarily driven by lower seed volume and reduced demand for insect control products in Latin America, and a 7 percent decline in volumes for Electronics & Communications, primarily driven by competitive pressures impacting sales of Solamet® paste. These declines more than offset volume growth for Performance Materials, Nutrition & Health, and Industrial Biosciences. Portfolio and other reflects the impact of the prior year sales of Glass Laminating Solutions/Vinyls within the Performance Materials segment and Sontara® within the Safety & Protection segment. The impact from local prices and product mix was about even with prior year as 3 percent higher Agriculture prices were offset primarily by lower prices in Performance Materials and Electronics & Communications. Net sales in developing markets were $8.2 billion, 33 percent of total company net sales versus 34 percent in 2014, representing a slight decline principally due to lower Agriculture volume in Latin America. Developing markets include China, India, countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and South East Asia.2014 versus 2013 The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2014 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from 2013: Percent Change Due to:(Dollars in billions)2014Net SalesPercentChange vs.2013LocalPrice and Product MixCurrencyVolumePortfolio and OtherWorldwide$28.4(2)—(1)—(1)U.S. & Canada11.4(3)——(2)(1)EMEA17.321—2(1)Asia Pacific6.2(2)(1)(2)3(2)Latin America3.5(7)(1)(3)(2)(1)1.

In addition, pre-tax exchange gains decreased $166 million compared to prior year driven by lower gains on foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 5 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by $145 million gain associated with the company's settlement of a legal claim related to the Safety & Protection segment and $85 million increase in equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to the absence of $65 million for charges associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment recorded in 2014. 2014 versus 2013 The $906 million increase was primarily due to $710 million of gains on sales of businesses and other assets, including a $391 million gain on the sale of GLS/Vinyls, within the Performance Materials segment, and a $240 million gain on the sale of copper fungicides and land management businesses, both within the Agriculture segment. There were additional net exchange gains of $297 million, partially offset by $65 million for charges associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment and the absence of the $26 million re-measurement gain on equity method investment in 2013.

The $21 million net benefit was recorded to adjust the estimated costs associated with the 2014 restructuring program due to lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions achieved through non-severance programs, offset by the identification of additional projects in certain segments.On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs compared to 2015. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2015, a pre-tax charge of $798 million was recorded, consisting of $793 million of employee separation / asset related charges, net and $5 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $656 million in severance and related benefit costs, $109 million in asset related charges, and $33 million in contract termination charges. Future cash expenditures related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $680 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits. The restructuring actions associated with this charge are expected to impact approximately 10 percent of DuPont’s workforce and to be substantially complete in 2016. 27Part IIITEM 7.

DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2014, a pre-tax charge of $541 million was recorded, consisting of $476 million in employee separation / asset related charges, net and $65 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $301 million severance and related benefit costs, $17 million of other non-personnel costs, and $223 million of asset related costs, including $65 million of costs associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The actions associated with this charge and all related payments are substantially complete.The $112 million in charges recorded during 2013 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consisted of a net $17 million restructuring benefit and a $129 million asset impairment charge discussed below. The net $17 million restructuring benefit consisted of a $26 million benefit associated with prior year restructuring programs offset by a $9 million charge resulting from restructuring actions related to a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. The majority of the $26 million benefit was due to the achievement of work force reductions through non-severance programs associated with the 2012 restructuring program.Asset ImpairmentsDuring 2015, the company recorded an impairment charge of $38 million in the Other segment, the majority relating to an impairment of a cost basis investment.During 2013, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of $129 million to write-down the carrying value of an asset group, within the Electronics & Communications segment, to fair value.Additional details related to the restructuring programs and asset impairments discussed above can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Below is a summary of the net impact related to items recorded in employee separation / asset related charges, net: (Dollars in millions)2015 (Charges) and Credits2014 (Charges) and Credits2013 (Charges) and CreditsAgriculture$(164)$(134)$1Electronics & Communications(78)(84)(131)Industrial Biosciences(52)(13)1Nutrition & Health(50)(15)6Performance Materials(58)(34)(6)Safety & Protection(49)(52)4Other(40)(22)1Corporate expenses(319)(122)12Total Charges$(810)$(476)$(112)(Dollars in millions)201520142013PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS$696$1,168$360Effective income tax rate26.9%27.1%14.0%In 2015, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $0.7 billion, reflecting a $0.5 billion decrease from 2014. The decrease was largely due to the impact associated with the company’s policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations, the absence of 2014 gains on sales of businesses and other assets in the Performance Materials and Agriculture segments, as well as increased tax benefits on employee separation/asset related charges.In 2014, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $1.2 billion, reflecting a $0.8 billion increase from 2013, largely due to the impact associated with the company’s policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary 28Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued assets and liabilities of its operations, gains on sales of businesses and other assets in the Performance Materials and Agriculture segments, and the impact of Imprelis® charges in 2013 versus additional insurance recoveries in 2014. These impacts were partially offset by increased tax benefits on employee separation/asset related charges. The higher effective tax rate principally reflects the impact of foreign exchange losses on net monetary assets for which no corresponding tax benefit is realized, in addition to the impact of the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation which is also nondeductible. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations, as well as items that significantly impact the company's effective income tax rate.(Dollars in millions)201520142013INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES$1,895$3,145$2,206Income from continuing operations after income taxes for 2015 was $1.9 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 and $2.2 billion in 2013. The changes between periods were due to the reasons noted above.Corporate OutlookCurrent difficult global economic conditions in agriculture and slower growth in emerging markets are expected to continue challenging the company’s sales growth in 2016. The company expects headwinds from currency due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar which is expected to be most significant in the first half of 2016. Growth in emerging markets is expected to slow, leading to a shift in the company’s earnings mix to higher tax jurisdictions. The company expects income from continuing operations in 2016 will benefit from $730 million reduction in costs as a result of the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan. These cost reductions will be weighted toward the second half of 2016 reflecting implementation of specific actions during the first and second quarters. In addition, the company expects income from continuing operations in 2016 to be impacted by transaction related costs associated with the proposed merger with Dow. See additional information regarding 2016 outlook under ""Segment Reviews"" beginning on page 30. Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. 29Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Segment ReviewsSegment operating earnings is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes excluding significant pre-tax benefits (charges), non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs includes all of the components of net periodic benefit cost from continuing operations with the exception of the service cost component. Reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year classifications. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (charges) excluded from segment operating earnings. All references to prices are on a U.S. dollar (USD) basis, including the impact of currency, unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of segment operating earnings to income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2015, 2014 and 2013 is included in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. DuPont Sustainable Solutions, within the company's Safety & Protection segment, is comprised of two business units: clean technologies and consulting solutions. Effective January 1, 2016, the clean technologies business unit will become part of the Industrial Biosciences segment with the focus on working with customers to improve the performance, productivity and sustainability of their products and processes. The company will explore a range of options to maximize the growth of the consulting solutions business unit which effective January 1, 2016 will be reported within Other. Sustainable solutions net sales accounted for about 2 percent of the company's total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Segment results and 2016 segment outlook information are not reflective of the 2016 reporting change. 30Part IIITEM 7.

In Brazil, lower corn seed volume reflects the impact of a reduction in summer planted hectares of corn and fall armyworm resistance impacting performance of certain corn hybrids. In North America, lower soybean volume reflects between 1 and 2 points of share loss and lower soybean planted area; lower corn planted area was partially offset by higher local corn seed prices. Lower crop protection volume is primarily due to low expected insect pressure, the adoption of insect protected soybean varieties, higher inventories, and a challenging macro environment. Insect control volumes were also impacted by the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility in Texas. 2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin decreased primarily due to the negative impact of currency of $538 million, lower sales, and an approximately $120 million negative impact of the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility and the absence of prior year impacts from performance-based compensation adjustments, partially offset by cost reductions and continued productivity improvements.2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $11.3 billion decreased $0.4 billion, or 4 percent, primarily due to lower corn seed volumes in Brazil and North America and the negative impact of currency, which was partly offset by an increase in crop protection volumes and higher local corn seed prices. In Brazil, corn seed market share and price were lower reflecting the impact of fall armyworm resistance and a reduction in planted hectares of corn. Higher volumes in insecticides were driven by continued growth in Rynaxypyr® insecticide and from successful launches of Cyazypyr® insecticide and new seed treatments in several markets. 2014 operating earnings decreased primarily due to lower corn seed volumes and the negative impact of currency which were partially offset by higher crop protection volumes, lower performance-based compensation expense of approximately $110 million, higher local seed prices and lower seed input costs. Operating earnings margin was about the same in each period. Outlook Farmer net returns for row crops continue to trend down as land and rent prices have lagged the transition on lower commodity prices as grain stocks remain at elevated levels. The company expects the economic environment in the agriculture sector to remain challenged with corn and soybean commodity prices at the low end of normal until demand accelerates or there is a disruption in global production. Volatile currency markets are expected to continue to present headwinds given the size of DuPont Agriculture's businesses in Europe and Latin America. As farmers look to relative economics between crop alternatives, the company expects a slight year over year increase in Brazil Safrinha and North America corn area, provided weather cooperates during planting. Pioneer's order book in North America suggests a modest improvement in corn demand at the expense of soybeans in a highly competitive seed market. In crop protection, continued weak demand for foliar-applied insecticides in Brazil and elevated distributor inventories will continue to present challenges. 31Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued For the first half of 2016, which reflects the majority of the northern hemisphere season, the company expects Agriculture sales to be mid-single digits percent lower with operating earnings in the low-teens percent below 2015 as local price gains and the benefit of cost actions are more than offset by lower insecticide and soybean volumes and currency. Crop protection's volume forecast assumes a continued impact from the shutdown of the LaPorte manufacturing facility. Volumes will be more challenged in the first quarter, due to the strong start in North America corn seed which benefited the fourth quarter of 2015, and due to crop protection in Brazil. Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be down mid-single digits percent and full year operating earnings are expected to be about flat as local price gains and cost actions are offset by currency headwinds and lower volumes.

These were partly offset by the absence of $20 million of OLED technology licensing income realized during 2013.Outlook In 2016 the company expects the photovoltaic market to remain strong with module installations forecasted to increase mid-teens percent driving strong growth in Tedlar® film in photovoltaics. Segment results are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by declines in Solamet® paste with the impact lessening in the second half of the year due to more favorable year-over-year comparisons and expected new product introductions. The company anticipates consumer electronics markets will have a weaker start to the year but strengthen in the second half as channel inventories are worked off.Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be about flat as strong volume growth in Tedlar® film for photovoltaics is offset by lower sales of Solamet® paste and lower metals pricing. Full year operating earnings are expected to be in the low-twenty percent range higher from increased volume and cost reductions and continued productivity improvements. 32Part IIITEM 7.

Outlook In 2016, market conditions are expected to remain challenging with currency headwinds persisting, primarily in Europe and Latin America. Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be down low-single digits percent as volume growth, driven by investments in probiotics and cultures, is more than offset by the negative impact of currency.

Partially offsetting the declines are increased ethylene volumes due to the prior year scheduled outage at the ethylene unit in Orange, Texas and increased demand for Performance Polymers offerings in automotive markets, primarily in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of 2015. 2015 operating earnings decreased as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by the negative impact of currency of $132 million and lower selling prices. 2015 operating earnings includes $49 million of benefits, comprised of a net benefit from a joint venture, the sale of a business and the realization of tax benefits associated with a manufacturing site. Operating earnings margin increased due primarily to cost reductions and continued productivity improvements. 2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $6.1 billion decreased $0.1 billion, or 2 percent, due primarily to the impact of the sale of GLS/Vinyls and decreased ethylene volumes as a result of the second quarter scheduled outage at the Orange, Texas ethylene unit. This was partially offset by increased demand in automotive markets, primarily in China, Europe and North America. 2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased due primarily to increased automotive demand, partially offset by the portfolio impact of the sale of GLS/Vinyls.Outlook Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be down in the low-single digits percent and full year operating earnings are expected to be down about 10 percent as volume growth will be more than offset by lower ethylene price and the negative impact of currency. 35Part IIITEM 7.

Decreased demand for Sustainable Solution offerings, Nomex® thermal resistant fiber and Kevlar® high strength materials was driven by a weakened oil and gas industry and military spending delays, partially offset by volume growth for Tyvek® protective material, including medical packaging. 2015 operating earnings decreased $68 million, or 9 percent, as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were more than offset by the negative impact of currency of $53 million and lower sales. 2015 operating earnings margin was flat from prior year as cost reductions and continued productivity improvements were offset by lower sales.2014 versus 2013 Full year 2014 segment net sales of $3.9 billion were essentially equal to prior year, as increased demand for Nomex® thermal resistant fiber and Kevlar® high strength materials was offset by impact of portfolio changes and lower sales for clean technologies offerings.2014 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased, due primarily to the above mentioned increase in volumes, productivity improvements and lower product costs, partially offset by lower sales from clean technologies offerings, a negative currency impact, and the portfolio impact of the Sontara® divestiture. Outlook Full year 2016 segment net sales are expected to be up by the low single digits percent with volume growth partially offset by the negative impact of currency. Full year operating earnings are expected to be up by the mid teens percent, on cost reductions and productivity improvements, leading to operating margin expansion for the year. 36Part IIITEM 7.

The company continually reviews its sources of liquidity and debt portfolio and occasionally may make adjustments to one or both to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum debt maturity schedule.The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows: Long-termShort-termOutlookStandard & Poor'sA-A-2Credit Watch NegativeMoody’s Investors ServiceA3P-2NegativeFitch RatingsAF1Rating Watch NegativeIn May 2015, Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) downgraded the company's long-term rating to A3 from A2, and the short-term rating to P-2 from P-1. In October 2015, Standard and Poor's Rating Services (Standard and Poor's) downgraded the company's long-term rating to A- from A, and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. In December 2015 following the announcement of the Merger Agreement with Dow, Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings placed the outlook on the company's long-term and the short-term rating on negative watch and Moody’s placed the company on negative outlook. The company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt maturities and other cash needs and that its current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings continue to provide access as needed to the capital markets. While the company expects that capacity for its commercial paper could be reduced as a result of its current short-term credit ratings, the company's liquidity needs can continue to be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing, committed receivable repurchase facilities and asset sales. The company has access to approximately $4.9 billion in unused credit lines, which includes a $4 billion revolving credit facility to support its commercial paper program, with several major financial institutions. These unused credit lines provide additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes including letters of credit. In February 2016, in line with seasonal agricultural working capital requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase agreement of up to $1 billion (the repurchase facility) that expires on November 30, 2016. Under the facility, the company may sell a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables within the Agriculture segment to participating institutions and simultaneously agree to repurchase at a future date. See further discussion of this facility in Item 9B, Other Information and Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 37Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are $6.2 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. of $4.2 billion and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are generally utilized to fund local operating activities and capital expenditure requirements and are expected to support non-U.S. liquidity needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The company expects domestic liquidity needs, for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter, will be met through existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. and the various sources of liquidity discussed above. Therefore, the company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic liquidity to support its assumption that undistributed earnings at December 31, 2015 can be considered reinvested indefinitely.(Dollars in millions)201520142013Cash provided by operating activities$2,316$3,712$3,179Cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 compared with a full year of results in 2014 for an impact of approximately $1.0 billion and a lower cash earnings contribution from continuing operations of approximately $0.3 billion.Cash provided by operating activities increased $0.5 billion in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower year over year income tax payments associated with the sale of businesses and higher insurance recoveries and lower claims payments related to Imprelis® (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).(Dollars in millions)201520142013Cash (used for) provided by investing activities$(1,828)$(337)$2,945Cash used for investing activities in 2015 increased by $1.5 billion compared to 2014. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds received from the sale of businesses in 2015 compared to 2014 and increase purchases of marketable securities in 2015 compared to 2014. This was partially offset by lower purchases of property, plant and equipment, mainly due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 which accounted for $0.3 billion. See Note 20 for further discussion of marketable securities outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014. Cash used for investing activities in 2014 decreased $3.3 billion compared to 2013. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds received from the sale of businesses in 2014 compared to 2013.Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.6 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Dividends per share of common stock were $1.72, $1.84, and $1.78 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In January 2016, the Board of Directors declared a first quarter common stock dividend of $0.38 per share. With the first quarter 2016 dividend, the company has paid quarterly consecutive dividends since the company’s first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904. 38Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In the first quarter 2015, DuPont announced its intention to buy back shares of about $4 billion using the distribution proceeds received from Chemours. In connection with the completion of the spin-off of Chemours, the Board of Directors authorized the use of the distribution proceeds to buy back shares of the company's common stock as follows: $2 billion to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2015 with the remainder to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2016. In August 2015, the company entered an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. Under the terms of the August 2015 ASR agreement, the company paid $2 billion to the financial institution and received and retired 35 million shares at an average price of $57.16 per share. See Part I, Item 5 Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.DuPont’s objective continues to be to complete the remaining $2 billion stock buyback by year end December 31, 2016. However, as a result of the planned merger of equals with Dow, the company expects it will have limited opportunities to enter the market prior to the shareholder vote on the merger. After the vote, the company plans to make repurchases. In January 2014, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan. In February and August 2014, the company entered into two separate ASR agreements. The February 2014 ASR agreement was completed in the second quarter of 2014, under which the company purchased and retired 15.1 million shares for $1 billion. The August 2014 ASR agreement was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, under which the company purchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $700 million. In addition to the ASR agreements, in 2014, the company repurchased and retired 4.7 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $300 million. In 2015, the company repurchased and retired 4.6 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $353 million. As a result, the company has completed $2.4 billion of repurchases as of December 31, 2015. The remainder of the $5 billion share buyback will be purchased in future periods as there is no required completion date for purchases under the 2014 plan. In December 2012, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share buyback plan. In 2013, the company entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution under which the company used $1 billion of the proceeds from the sale of Performance Coatings for the purchase and retirement 20.4 million shares of common stock.See Note 17 Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the above share buyback plans.(Dollars in millions)201520142013Cash provided by operating activities$2,316$3,712$3,179Purchases of property, plant and equipment(1,629)(2,020)(1,882)Free cash flow$687$1,692$1,297Free cash flow is a measurement not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.

Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process.For further information relating to the change in cash provided by operating activities, see discussion above under cash provided by operating activities. 39Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Long-term Employee BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.About 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S. the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plan's actuary as of the measurement date. For non-U.S. benefit plans, the company utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plans' assets. In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)201520142013Market-related value of assets$15.1$15.9$15.5Fair value of plan assets14.415.816.1For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets. 40Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company changed the method it used to estimate the 2016 service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. benefit plans. For these plans, the company has historically estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve and cash flow for measurement of the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these 2016 components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The company made this change as it believes it is a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The company considers this a change in estimate, and, accordingly, will account for it prospectively starting in 2016. This change does not affect the measure of the total benefit obligation. See information with the respect to the impact of the change in method on 2016 pension expense under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 45. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/2 PercentagePointIncrease1/2 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$72$(74)Expected rate of return on plan assets88(88)In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries released final reports of new mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale for measurement of retirement program obligations in the U.S. The company adopted these tables in measuring the 2014 long-term employee benefit obligations. This adoption increased the benefit obligation at December 31, 2014 by approximately $1.7 billion. The effect of this adoption was amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2015. In October 2015, the Society of Actuaries released an updated mortality improvement scale reflecting a decline in longevity projection from the October 2014 release. This release was adopted by the company in measuring the 2015 long-term employee benefit obligations in the U.S. This adoption decreased the benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 by approximately $0.4 billion. The effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2016.Additional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 45 and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Matters DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $492 million as of December 31, 2015; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.0 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2015. 41Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Legal Contingencies The company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Indemnification AssetsPursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the distribution. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the Separation Agreement and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as solvency of Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Income TaxesThe breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that net reductions to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be in the range of $225 million to $250 million within the next 12 months with the majority due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.At December 31, 2015, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $3.4 billion, net of valuation allowance of $1.5 billion. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax asset balance. 42Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Valuation of Assets The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets, investments in affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.Based on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test, completed in the third quarter 2015, we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. In the fourth quarter 2015, the company elected to defer further testing and deployment of a multi-year, phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. At December 31, 2015, the company has capitalized costs associated with the ERP system of approximately $435 million which have not yet been placed in service. It remains probable that the ERP system will be completed and placed in service. 43Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsCertain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.Contractual ObligationsInformation related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In(Dollars in millions)Total atDecember 31,201520162017 –20182019 –20202021 andbeyondLong-term debt obligations1$8,777$1,115$1,353$1,506$4,803Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity3,2133716494351,758Capital leases1131228Operating leases1,238248411303276Purchase obligations2 Information technology infrastructure & services157566833—Raw material obligations31,524561468296199Utility obligations196118332520Human resource services403091—License agreements41,545351474370350Other16579472514Total purchase obligations3,6271,1951,099750583Other liabilities1,5,6 Workers' compensation9116391719Asset retirement obligations4926338Environmental remediation49212513482151Legal settlements141445Other716553231574Total other long-term liabilities811197206121287Total contractual obligations8$17,679$3,127$3,720$3,117$7,7151.

Includes raw material obligations related to supply agreements with Koch Industries, Inc. (INVISTA). 4. Primarily represents remaining minimum payments under DuPont Pioneer license agreements.5. Pension and other long-term employee benefit obligations have been excluded from the table above. Expected 2016 funding for the principal U.S. pension plan and non-U.S. plans with plan assets is disclosed below within Long Term Employee Benefits. Contributions beyond 2016 are expected to be made, however, the amount of contributions are dependent on the future economic environment, investment returns on pension trust assets, as well as rules and regulations of the respective country in which the plans operate. The company’s remaining pension plans with no plan assets and other long-term employee benefits plans are paid from operating cash flows. The benefit payments for these plans are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of benefit payments are uncertain. The estimated benefit payments in 2016 for these plans are disclosed below within Long Term Employee Benefits. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. 6. The company's contractual obligations do not reflect an offset for recoveries associated with indemnifications by Chemours in accordance with the Separation Agreement. Refer to Note 3 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail related to the indemnifications.7. Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other long-term employee benefits.8. Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations. 44Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Long-term Employee BenefitsThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. No contributions were made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2015 and the company expects to contribute $230 million to this plan in 2016. Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $164 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan in 2015.U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $144 million to its unfunded plans in 2015.The company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $237 million, $233 million and $207 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.In 2016, the company expects to contribute about the same as 2015 for pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, its remaining plans with no plan assets and its other long-term employee benefit plans.The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:(Dollars in millions)201520142013Long-term employee benefit plan charges 1$616$715$1,1531. The long-term employee benefit plan charges include discontinued operations of $(245), $96 and $113 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.The above charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2015 is due to a curtailment gain partially offset by a decrease in discount rate. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2014 is primarily related to higher discount rates and better than expected pension asset returns. See ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 40 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense. 45Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2016, long term employee benefits expense from continuing operations is expected to decrease by about $230 million due to the adoption of the full yield curve approach and a higher discount rate which will be partially offset by a lower expected return on plan assets for the US pension plan from 8.5% to 8.0%. The adoption of the full yield curve approach will reduce 2016 expense by $210 million as a result of a $10 million and $200 million reduction in service and interest cost components, respectively. The estimated 2016 long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations does not include the impact of any settlement losses or curtailment gains resulting from actions associated with the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring program, as it cannot be estimated at this time.Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations are summarized below:(Dollars in millions)201520142013Environmental operating costs$380$380$375Increase in remediation accrual1189590 $498$475$465About 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2015 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. Remediation Accrual Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2013$458Remediation payments(75)Increase in remediation accrual95Balance at December 31, 2014$478Remediation payments(104)Increase in remediation accrual118Balance at December 31, 2015$492 46Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $1.0 billion above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2015. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $492 million, that have an estimated liability of $291 million as of December 31, 2015 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $610 million above the amount accrued. As such, the company has recorded an indemnification asset of $291 million corresponding to the company's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2015.As of December 31, 2015, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 100 sites for which DuPont does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 140 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 190 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at one new site during 2015 compared with three and five similar notices in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Environmental Capital Expenditures In 2015, the company spent approximately $20 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be about $40 million in 2016. In the U.S., additional capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, management does not believe that the costs to comply with these requirements will have a material impact on the financial position or liquidity of the company. Climate Change The company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2010, as of 2014 the company reduced its environmental footprint, achieving reductions of 9 percent in GHG emissions intensity and 8 percent in water consumption versus a 2010 baseline. In addition, as of 2014, the company achieved an 11 percent reduction in energy intensity from non-renewable resources versus a 2010 baseline. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. The company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate.There are existing efforts to address GHG emissions at the national and regional levels. Several of the company's facilities in the European Union (EU) are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. China has begun pilot programs for carbon taxes and trading of GHG emissions in selected areas. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many company facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. 47Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a phased-in scheme to regulate GHG emissions first from large stationary sources under the existing CAA permitting requirements administered by state and local authorities. Large capital investments may be required to install Best Available Control Technology on major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. In 2015, the EPA promulgated regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from new and reconstructed/modified Electric Generating Units (EGU's). In 2015, the EPA also promulgated new regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from existing EGUs that would be based on individual state emission reduction programs. These regulations are currently being challenged in the U.S. federal court. If the regulations survive these challenges, they may affect the long term price and supply of electricity and natural gas and demand for products that contribute to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The precise impact of the aforementioned regulations is uncertain due to the flexibility provided to the states in developing their programs and anticipated legal challenges to this regulatory approach. A comprehensive national policy that addresses climate change by relying on market-based mechanisms to drive reductions in greenhouse gases is likely to be more economically efficient than the facility-by-facility controls that would result from implementation of recently promulgated rules under EPA’s existing authorities.At the international level, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace, highlighting the need for coordinated global policy actions. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets. 48Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The company has established a variety of programs including use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RisksThe company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the European Euro (EUR), Brazilian Real, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen. The company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Certain foreign entities of the company held USD denominated marketable securities, mainly US government securities, at December 31, 2015. The USD/EUR is the primary foreign exchange exposure for these nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities. These marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” and as such, fluctuations in foreign exchange are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) within the Consolidated Statements of Equity. These fluctuations are subsequently reclassified from AOCI to earnings in the period in which the marketable securities are sold. The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts and nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The sensitivities for foreign currency contracts and nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates.

These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. As of December 31, 2015, no one individual customer balance represented more than five percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. 49Part II",2023-12-30 21:52:11.405565

For some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements, see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 9.Overview DuPont Dow Merger of Equals On December 11, 2015, DuPont and Dow announced entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals (the Merger Transaction), subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval. The combined company will be named DowDuPont Inc. (DowDuPont). DuPont's special meeting of stockholders was held on July 20, 2016, which resulted in a vote for adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of related matters. Closing of the Merger Transaction is expected to occur in the first half of 2017, pending satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval.Following the consummation of the merger, Dow and DuPont intend to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the board of directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company’s agriculture business, specialty products business and material science business through a series of tax-efficient transactions (the Intended Business Separations). Dow and DuPont currently anticipate that the Intended Business Separations will occur about 18 months after the merger is consummated. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the company incurred $386 million and $10 million, respectively, of costs in connection with the planned merger with Dow and the Intended Business Separations, including costs relating to integration and separation planning. These costs were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the company's Consolidated Income Statements and primarily include financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses.See the discussion entitled DuPont Dow Merger of Equals under Part 1, Item 1 Business of this report, Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details and a discussion of some of the risks related to the transaction.Purpose DuPont’s businesses serve markets where the increasing demand for more and healthier food, renewably sourced materials and fuels, and advanced industrial materials is creating substantial growth opportunities. The company’s unique combination of sciences, proven research and development (R&D) engine, broad global reach, and deep market penetration are distinctive competitive advantages that position the company to continue capitalizing on this enormous potential. DuPont has dramatically refined its portfolio to focus investment in areas where it sees significant opportunity and secular growth; enhanced its innovation platform to deliver substantial revenues from new products; increased focus on efficiency, cost discipline, and accountability; and expanded markets geographically. The company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth. Results DuPont 2016 sales were $24.6 billion, 2 percent below last year, reflecting a 1 percent decline from the negative impact of weaker currencies and a 1 percent decline due to lower prices and product mix. Volume growth in Performance Materials, Nutrition & Health, and Industrial Biosciences was offset by declines in the other segments. Income from continuing operations before taxes of $3.3 billion was up 26 percent versus $2.6 billion in prior year, on cost savings and lower pension and other post employment benefits (OPEB) costs. Pension and OPEB costs were down 63 percent year over year, primarily due to curtailment gains recognized as a result of changes made to the U.S. Pension and OPEB benefits in 2016. 23Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of Operations 2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring Plan On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan (the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan) designed to reduce costs in 2016 by $730 million compared with 2015, which represents a reduction of operating costs on a run-rate basis of about $1.0 billion by the end of 2016. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of $798 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $656 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, in connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a net pre-tax benefit to earnings of $85 million, comprised of a net reduction of $154 million in severance and related benefit costs, offset by $53 million of asset related charges, and $16 million of contract termination costs. This was primarily due to a reduction in severance and related benefit costs partially offset by the identification of additional projects in certain segments. The reduction in severance and related benefit costs was driven by elimination of positions at a lower cost than expected as a result of redeployments and attrition as well as lower than estimated individual severance costs. The 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan delivered the target cost reductions versus prior year. The restructuring actions associated with this charge affected approximately 10 percent of DuPont’s workforce and are now substantially complete. Redesign Initiative and 2014 Restructuring Plan In June 2014, DuPont announced its global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to reduce costs and improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2014, a pre-tax charge of $541 million was recorded. Cost reductions from the 2014 operational redesign were essentially completed during 2015 and for full year 2015, the company delivered incremental cost savings of approximately $440 million year over year. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Separation of Performance Chemicals In October 2013, DuPont announced its intention to separate its Performance Chemicals segment through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders, subject to customary closing conditions. In July 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (Chemours). 24Part IIITEM 7.

Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).Net sales of $24.6 billion were 2 percent below prior year, reflecting a 1 percent reduction due to currency and a 1 percent decrease due to lower local prices. Negative currency impact was primarily due to the weaker European euro, Mexican peso, and Chinese yuan, partly offset by the stronger Japanese yen and Brazilian real. The 1 percent negative impact from lower local prices primarily reflects lower prices in Performance Materials, largely polymers, lower Electronics & Communications prices and flat prices for Agriculture where higher prices in EMEA and Latin America were offset by declines in North America. Worldwide volume was flat as growth in Performance Materials, Nutrition & Health, and Industrial Biosciences was offset by lower volume in Electronics & Communications, Protection Solutions, and Agriculture, the latter due to lower sales of crop protection products. Net sales in developing markets, were $8.4 billion, up 2 percent, with 4 percent higher volume, principally due to strong growth in Agriculture, Performance Materials, Electronics & Communications, and Nutrition & Health, in developing Asia Pacific. Sales growth in developing markets was partly offset by a negative currency impact. Representing 34 percent of total company sales, developing markets include China, India, and countries in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, and Africa. 25Part IIITEM 7.

Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).Net sales of $25.1 billion were down 12 percent versus prior year reflecting a 7 percent negative impact from weaker currencies, particularly the Brazilian real and the European euro, 3 percent lower volume and a 2 percent negative impact from the absence of sales from divested businesses. Lower volume principally reflects a 6 percent decline in Agriculture that was primarily driven by lower seed volume and reduced demand for insect control products in Latin America, a 7 percent decline in volumes for Electronics & Communications, primarily driven by competitive pressures impacting sales of Solamet® paste, and a 2 percent decline in volumes for Industrial Biosciences due to lower demand for biomaterials and clean technologies offerings. These declines more than offset volume growth for Performance Materials, Nutrition & Health, and Protection Solutions. Portfolio and other reflects the impact of the prior year sales of Glass Laminating Solutions/Vinyls within the Performance Materials segment and Sontara® within the Protection Solutions segment. The impact from local prices and product mix was about even with prior year as 3 percent higher Agriculture prices were offset primarily by lower prices in Performance Materials and Electronics & Communications. Net sales in developing markets were $8.2 billion, 33 percent of total company net sales versus 34 percent in 2014, representing a slight decline principally due to lower Agriculture volume in Latin America. Developing markets include China, India, countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and South East Asia.(Dollars in millions)201620152014COST OF GOODS SOLD$14,469$15,112$17,023As a percent of net sales59%60%60%2016 versus 2015 Cost of goods sold (COGS) decreased $0.6 billion, or 4 percent, principally due to lower raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB costs, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus global currencies. COGS as a percentage of sales was 59 percent versus 60 percent last year, principally due to lower raw material costs and lower pension and OPEB costs. 2015 versus 2014 COGS decreased $1.9 billion, or 11 percent, principally reflecting declines from currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus global currencies, productivity improvements, impacts of portfolio changes, lower volume and lower raw material costs. COGS as a percent of sales was unchanged from prior year at 60 percent as the benefit of productivity improvements offset the negative impact of currency which decreased sales by 7 percent and COGS by 4 percent.(Dollars in millions)201620152014OTHER OPERATING CHARGES$686$459$645As a percent of net sales3%2%2%2016 versus 2015 Other operating charges increased $227 million, or 49 percent, reflecting a $152 million decrease in Imprelis® herbicide insurance recoveries, and a $23 million reduction in the estimated liability related to Imprelis® herbicide claims versus a $130 million accrual reduction in the prior year.2015 versus 2014 Other operating charges decreased $186 million, or 29 percent, principally reflecting $130 million reduction in the estimated liability related to Imprelis® herbicide claims, cost savings from the company's operational redesign initiative partially offset by lower insurance recoveries year over year related to Imprelis® herbicide claims. 26Part IIITEM 7.

Pre-tax exchange losses increased $136 million compared to prior year. See Notes 5 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.2015 versus 2014 The $580 million decrease was primarily due to the absence of prior year gains on sales of businesses and other assets, including a $391 million gain on the sale of GLS/Vinyls, within the Performance Materials segment, and a $240 million gain on the sale of copper fungicides and land management businesses, both within the Agriculture segment, partially offset by gains on sales of businesses and assets in 2015, primarily in the Agriculture and Performance Materials segments. In addition, pre-tax exchange gains decreased $166 million compared to prior year driven by lower gains on foreign currency exchange contracts. See Notes 5 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities. These decreases were partially offset by $145 million gain associated with the company's settlement of a legal claim related to the Protection Solutions segment and $85 million increase in equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to the absence of $65 million for charges associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment recorded in 2014.Additional information related to the company's other income, net is included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 27Part IIITEM 7.

These charges were partially offset by a net $88 million benefit related to the 2016 restructuring plan, primarily due to a reduction in severance and related benefit costs driven by the elimination of positions at a lower cost than expected, and a $21 million benefit related to the 2014 restructuring plan for adjustments to the previously recognized severance costs.The $810 million in charges recorded during 2015 in employee separation / asset related charges, net consist of a $793 million charge related to the 2016 restructuring plan discussed below, and a $38 million impairment charge discussed below, partly offset by a $21 million net benefit related to the 2014 restructuring plan. The $21 million net benefit was recorded to adjust the estimated costs associated with the 2014 restructuring program due to lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions achieved through non-severance programs, offset by the identification of additional projects in certain segments.On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs compared to 2015. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all businesses and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating businesses and aligning staff functions more closely with them. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2015, a pre-tax charge of $798 million was recorded, consisting of $793 million of employee separation / asset related charges, net and $5 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $656 million in severance and related benefit costs, $109 million in asset related charges, and $33 million in contract termination charges. The $476 million in charges recorded during 2014 in employee separation / asset related charges, net related to the 2014 global, multi-year initiative to redesign its global organization and operating model to improve productivity and agility across all businesses and functions. DuPont commenced a restructuring plan to realign and rebalance staff function support, enhance operational efficiency, and to reduce residual costs associated with the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2014, a pre-tax charge of $541 million was recorded, consisting of $476 million in employee separation / asset related charges, net and $65 million in other income, net. The charges consisted of $301 million severance and related benefit costs, $17 million of other non-personnel costs, and $223 million of asset related costs, including $65 million of costs associated with the restructuring actions of a joint venture within the Performance Materials segment. Asset Impairments During 2016, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of $435 million related to its uncompleted enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The company intends to complete the ERP system project, however, given the uncertainties related to timing as well as potential developments and changes to technologies in the market place at the time of restart, use of the ERP system can no longer be considered probable. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to this charge. During 2016, the company recorded a $158 million impairment charge related to indefinite-lived intangible trade names within the Industrial Biosciences segment as a result of the realignment of brand marketing strategies and a determination to phase out the use of certain acquired trade names.During 2015, the company recorded an impairment charge of $38 million in the Other segment, the majority relating to an impairment of a cost basis investment. 28Part IIITEM 7.

The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate compared to 2015 was largely due to the impact of reduced net exchange losses recognized on the re-measurement of net monetary asset positions which were not tax deductible in the relevant local jurisdictions.In 2015, the company recorded a tax provision on continuing operations of $696 million, reflecting a $472 million decrease from 2014. The decrease was largely due to the impact associated with the company’s policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations, the absence of 2014 gains on sales of businesses and other assets in the Performance Materials and Agriculture segments, as well as increased tax benefits on employee separation / asset related charges.See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations, as well as items that significantly impact the company's effective income tax rate.(Dollars in millions)201620152014INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AFTER INCOME TAXES$2,521$1,895$3,145Income from continuing operations after income taxes for 2016 was $2.5 billion compared to $1.9 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2014.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Corporate Outlook Globally, GDP and industrial production are expected to grow 2.7 and 2.4 percent, respectively, in 2017. The company expects this growth will be challenged by the current difficult global economic conditions in agriculture, economic uncertainty in the U.S., political and economic uncertainty in Europe and slowing conditions in China from the continued shift of industrial production to services and consumer sectors. The company expects headwinds from currency due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. In the agriculture sector, commodity prices are under pressure from record yields and crop productions. As farmers look to relative economics between crop alternatives, the company expects them to favor soybeans over corn in North America which is generally less favorable to the company’s overall income from continuing operations. In crop protection, the company expects the industry decline to ease in 2017, but continues to be negatively impacted by high inventory levels, a stronger U.S. dollar, and the continued penetration of insect-resistant soybeans. In the auto sector, according to IHS, auto growth is expected to slow in 2017, with 1 percent growth year over year. As the company prepares for the close of the planned merger with Dow, the company expects income from continuing operations in 2017 to be impacted by transaction related costs associated with the merger and the Intended Business Separations, including costs related to integration and separation planning.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. 30Part IIITEM 7.

DuPont Sustainable Solutions, previously within the company's former Safety & Protection segment (now Protection Solutions), was comprised of two business units: clean technologies and consulting solutions. Effective January 1, 2016, the clean technologies business unit became part of the Industrial Biosciences segment with the focus on working with customers to improve the performance, productivity and sustainability of their products and processes. The company is exploring a range of options to maximize the growth of the consulting solutions business unit which effective January 1, 2016 is reported within Other. Reclassifications of prior year data have been made to conform to current year classifications. 31Part IIITEM 7.

Lower crop protection volumes are primarily due to lower insecticide volumes from low pest pressure and high inventories, and lower fungicide volumes. Seed volumes were flat year over year as increased corn seed volumes in Latin America and North America due to higher acreage and new product launches, were offset by the shift in timing of seed sales primarily related to the southern U.S. route-to-market change and lower soybean volumes. The shift in timing moved approximately $200 million of sales from fourth quarter 2016 to first quarter 2017.2016 operating earnings and operating earnings margin increased as cost savings and lower product costs were partially offset by timing of seed deliveries, primarily related to the southern U.S. route-to-market change and the negative impact of currency.2015 versus 2014 Full year 2015 segment net sales of $9.8 billion decreased $1.5 billion, or 13 percent, primarily due to the negative impact of currency and lower seed and crop protection volumes, primarily in Brazil and North America, which were partly offset by higher local corn seed prices. In Brazil, lower corn seed volume reflects the impact of a reduction in summer planted hectares of corn and fall armyworm resistance impacting performance of certain corn hybrids. In North America, lower soybean volume reflects between 1 and 2 points of share loss and lower soybean planted area; lower corn planted area was partially offset by higher local corn seed prices. Lower crop protection volume is primarily due to low expected insect pressure, the adoption of insect protected soybean varieties, higher inventories, and a challenging macro environment. Insect control volumes were also impacted by the shutdown of the La Porte manufacturing facility in Texas. 2015 operating earnings and operating earnings margin decreased primarily due to the negative impact of currency of $538 million, lower sales, and an approximately $120 million negative impact of the shutdown of the La Porte manufacturing facility and the absence of prior year impacts from performance-based compensation adjustments, partially offset by cost reductions and continued productivity improvements. 32Part IIITEM 7.

The company continually reviews its sources of liquidity and debt portfolio and occasionally may make adjustments to one or both to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum debt maturity schedule.The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows: Long-termShort-termOutlookStandard & Poor'sA-A-2Credit Watch NegativeMoody’s Investors ServiceA3P-2NegativeFitch RatingsAF1Rating Watch NegativeThe company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt maturities and other cash needs and that its current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings continue to provide access as needed to the capital markets. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing, committed receivable repurchase facilities and asset sales. The company has access to approximately $7.9 billion in unused credit lines with several major financial institutions including unused commitments of $4 billion under the Term Loan Facility described below and a $3 billion revolving credit facility to support its commercial paper program. These unused credit lines provide additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs and general corporate purposes including letters of credit. In March 2016, the company entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (the Term Loan Facility). DuPont may make up to seven term loan borrowings within one year of the closing date and amounts repaid or prepaid are not available for subsequent borrowings. The proceeds from the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will be used for the company's general corporate purposes including debt repayment, working capital and share repurchases. The Term Loan Facility matures in March 2019 at which time all outstanding borrowings, including accrued but unpaid interest, become immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2016, the company had borrowed $0.5 billion and had unused commitments of $4 billion under the Term Loan Facility.In addition, in March 2016, the company amended the existing revolving credit facility to reduce the aggregate principal amount of commitments from $4 billion to $3 billion consistent with lower expected commercial paper borrowings. The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings and generally consistent with those applicable to DuPont’s long-term public debt. The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization for DuPont and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.6667. At December 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with this financial covenant. 38Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility impose additional affirmative and negative covenants on DuPont and its subsidiaries after the closing of the proposed merger with Dow, subject to certain limitations, including to:•not sell, lease or otherwise convey to DowDupont, its shareholders or its non-DuPont subsidiaries, any assets or properties of DuPont or its subsidiaries unless the aggregate amount of revenues attributable to all such assets and properties so conveyed after the merger does not exceed 30 percent of the consolidated revenues of DuPont and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 (the Disposition Limitation); and•not guarantee any indebtedness or other obligations of DowDuPont, Dow or ther respective subsidiaries (other than of DuPont and its subsidiaries).The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility will terminate, and the loans and other amounts thereunder would become due and payable, upon the sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Agriculture line of businesses to DowDuPont, its shareholders or any of its non-DuPont subsidiaries.In February 2016, in line with seasonal agricultural working capital requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $1 billion (the 2016 repurchase facility) that expired on November 30, 2016. Under the facility, the company sold a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables within the Agriculture segment to participating institutions and simultaneously agreed to repurchase at a future date. In January 2017, the company entered into a new committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $1.3 billion (the 2017 repurchase facility) which expires on November 30, 2017. The 2017 repurchase facility has substantially similar terms and conditions as the 2016 repurchase facility and includes the 2016 repurchase facility change of control language conformed to the Disposition Limitation covenant described above. See further discussion of the 2017 repurchase facility in Item 9B, Other Information and Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are $6.0 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. of $5.8 billion and $4.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are generally utilized to fund local operating activities and capital expenditure requirements and are expected to support non-U.S. liquidity needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The company expects domestic liquidity needs, for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter, will be met through existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. and the various sources of liquidity discussed above. Therefore, the company believes that it has sufficient sources of domestic liquidity to support its assumption that undistributed earnings at December 31, 2016 can be considered reinvested indefinitely.(Dollars in millions)201620152014Cash provided by operating activities$3,300$2,316$3,712Cash provided by operating activities increased $1.0 billion primarily due to a higher earnings contribution of approximately $0.5 billion, lower year-over-year income tax payments and lower working capital. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.4 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 compared with a full year of results in 2014 for an impact of approximately $1.0 billion and a lower cash earnings contribution from continuing operations of approximately $0.3 billion.(Dollars in millions)201620152014Cash used for investing activities$(1,514)$(1,828)$(337)Cash used for investing activities in 2016 decreased by $0.3 billion compared to 2015. The change was primarily due to lower purchases of property, plant and equipment, lower net purchases of marketable securities and higher proceeds from sales of businesses and other assets. This is partially offset by cash outflows relating to foreign currency contract settlements. The absence in 2016 of property, plant and equipment expenditures related to Chemours accounted for $0.2 billion of the reduction. 39Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Cash used for investing activities in 2015 increased by $1.5 billion compared to 2014. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds received from the sale of businesses in 2015 compared to 2014 and increased purchases of marketable securities in 2015 compared to 2014. This was partially offset by lower purchases of property, plant and equipment, mainly due to the absence of Chemours in the second half of 2015 which accounted for $0.3 billion. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of marketable securities outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014.Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.0 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The company expects 2017 purchases of property, plant and equipment to be about $1.1 billion.(Dollars in millions)201620152014Cash used for financing activities$(2,328)$(1,823)$(5,074)The $0.5 billion increase in cash used for financing activities in 2016 was primarily due to lower borrowings as a result of the prior year distribution of approximately $3.9 billion which Chemours financed through external borrowings and paid to the company prior to its separation. This was partially offset by lower share repurchases and lower dividends paid to stockholders.The $3.3 billion decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2015 was primarily due to the distribution of Chemours borrowings to the company as part of the separation, partially offset by a reduction in short term borrowings, and an increase in the repurchase of common stock.Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.52, $1.72, and $1.84 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In January 2017, the Board of Directors declared a first quarter common stock dividend of $0.38 per share. With the first quarter 2017 dividend, the company has paid quarterly consecutive dividends since the company’s first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904. In the first quarter 2015, DuPont announced its intention to buy back about $4 billion of shares using the distribution proceeds received from Chemours. In connection with the completion of the spin-off of Chemours, the Board of Directors authorized the use of the distribution proceeds to buy back shares of the company's common stock as follows: $2 billion to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2015 with the remainder to be purchased and retired by December 31, 2016. During 2015, the company purchased and retired 35 million shares through a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement. The company had limited opportunity to repurchase shares in 2016, primarily due to the planned merger with Dow. However, during 2016, the company purchased and retired 13.2 million shares in the open market at a cost of $916 million. As of January 1, 2017, the authorization under this buyback program has expired. In January 2014, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan. During 2014, the company purchased and retired 30.1 million shares for $2 billion under two separate ASR agreements as well as open market purchases. In 2015, the company repurchased and retired 4.6 million shares in the open market for a total cost of $353 million. As a result, the company has completed $2.4 billion of repurchases as of December 31, 2016. There is no required completion date for purchases under this plan. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the above share buyback plans. 40Part IIITEM 7.

All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process. For further information relating to the change in cash provided by operating activities, see discussion above under cash provided by operating activities. 41Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Long-term Employee BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other post employment benefit (OPEB) plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.About 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's OPEB obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S. the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. Effective in 2016, the company began to measure the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The company made this change as it believes it is a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The company considers this a change in estimate, and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not affect the measure of the total benefit obligation. Historically, the service and interest cost components were estimated utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve and cash flow for measurement of the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. For non-U.S. benefit plans, the company utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets. 42Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)2016 120152014Market-related value of assets$13.5$15.1$15.9Fair value of plan assets 13.514.415.81. During 2016, the plan's trust fund paid about $550 million to a group of separated, vested plan participants who elected a limited-time opportunity to receive a lump sum payout. See further discussion under ""Long Term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 47.For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and OPEB plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/2 PercentagePointIncrease1/2 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$51$(55)Expected rate of return on plan assets80(80)In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries released final reports of new mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale for measurement of retirement program obligations in the U.S. The Society of Actuaries published other mortality improvement scales in October 2015 and October 2016. The company adopted these tables in measuring the 2015 and 2016 long-term employee benefit obligations, respectively. The effect of these adoptions is amortized into net periodic benefit cost for the years following the adoption. Additional information with respect to pension and OPEB expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 47 and in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Matters DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company has recorded a liability of $457 million as of December 31, 2016; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $900 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2016. 43Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Indemnification Assets Pursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation and other liabilities that arose prior to the separation. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the Separation Agreement and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as solvency of Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Income Taxes The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that net reductions to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be in the range of $70 million to $90 million within the next 12 months with the majority due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.At December 31, 2016, the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of $2.9 billion, net of valuation allowance of $1.3 billion. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax asset balance. 44Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Valuation of Assets The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investments in affiliates and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.Based on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test, completed in the third quarter 2016, we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 percent, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow, revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate.During 2016, the company recorded a $158 million impairment charge related to indefinite-lived intangible trade names within the Industrial Biosciences segment as a result of the realignment of brand marketing strategies and a determination to phase out the use of certain acquired trade names. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to this charge. During 2016, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of $435 million related to its uncompleted ERP system. The company intends to complete the ERP system project, however, given the uncertainties related to timing as well as potential developments and changes to technologies in the market place at the time of restart, use of the ERP system can no longer be considered probable. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to this charge. 45Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsCertain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.Contractual Obligations Information related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In(Dollars in millions)Total atDecember 31,201620172018 - 20192020 - 20212022 andbeyondLong-term debt obligations1$8,137$4$2,327$2,506$3,300Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity2,8753515613331,630Capital leases19—234Operating leases1,203263440281219Purchase obligations2 Information technology infrastructure & services18793922—Raw material obligations31,07048028920299Utility obligations1251051442License agreements41,456281462366347Other1227923155Total purchase obligations2,9601,038880589453Other liabilities1,5,6 Workers' compensation8615371618Environmental remediation4571651378075Legal settlements176443Other715343251966Total other long-term liabilities713229203119162Total contractual obligations8$15,897$1,885$4,413$3,831$5,7681.

Pension and OPEB obligations have been excluded from the table above. Expected 2017 funding for the principal U.S. pension plan and non-U.S. plans with plan assets is disclosed below within Long Term Employee Benefits. Contributions beyond 2017 are expected to be made, however, the amount of contributions are dependent on the future economic environment, investment returns on pension trust assets, as well as rules and regulations of the respective country in which the plans operate. The company’s remaining pension plans with no plan assets and other post employment benefit plans are paid from operating cash flows. The benefit payments for these plans are excluded from the table above as the timing and amounts of benefit payments are uncertain. The estimated benefit payments in 2017 for these plans are disclosed below within Long Term Employee Benefits. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the pension and other post employment benefit plans. 6. The company's contractual obligations do not reflect an offset for recoveries associated with indemnifications by Chemours in accordance with the Separation Agreement. Refer to Notes 3 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail related to the indemnifications.7.

Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations. 46Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Long-term Employee BenefitsThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other post employment benefits or OPEB plans). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The company will freeze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans at the earlier of the effective date of the first of the Intended Business Separations or November 30, 2018 (the Effective Date). See further discussion of the Intended Business Separations under ""DuPont Dow Merger of Equals"" beginning on page 2. Therefore, as of the Effective Date, active employees in the U.S. plans will not accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received. In addition to the changes to the U.S. pension plans, eligible employees who will be under the age of 50 at the Effective Date will not receive post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits. As a result of these changes, the company recognized a pre-tax curtailment gain of $382 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.In the fourth quarter 2016, about $550 million of lump-sum payments were made from the principal U.S. pension plan trust fund to a group of separated, vested plan participants who were extended a limited-time opportunity and voluntarily elected to receive their pension benefits in a single lump-sum payment.Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company contributed $230 million to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2016 and the company expects to contribute about the same amount to this plan in 2017. Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $121 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan in 2016.U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $184 million to its unfunded plans in 2016.The company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $218 million, $237 million and $233 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.In 2017, the company expects to contribute $95 million for pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, $85 million to its remaining plans with no plan assets, and $275 million for its OPEB plans. 47Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:(Dollars in millions)201620152014Long-term employee benefit plan charges 1$442$616$7151.The long-term employee benefit plan charges include discontinued operations of $(5), $(245) and $96 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.The above charges for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in long-term employee benefit expense in 2016 is driven by the curtailment gain recognized in 2016 related to the changes to the U.S. long term employee benefits described above. The decrease in 2015 is primarily due to a curtailment gain, which is presented within income from discontinued operations, partially offset by a decrease in discount rate. See ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 42 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.The company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other post employment benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2017, long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations is expected to increase by about $340 million mainly due to the curtailment gain recognized in 2016. This amount does not include any potential settlement charges related to the company's Pension Restoration Plan which provides lump sum payments to certain eligible retirees.Environmental Matters The company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations are summarized below:(Dollars in millions)201620152014Environmental operating costs$370$380$380Environmental remediation costs606535 $430$445$415About 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations in 2016 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. 48Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Remediation Accrual Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2014$478Remediation payments1(104)Net increase in remediation accrual2118Balance at December 31, 2015$492Remediation payments1(143)Net increase in remediation accrual2108Balance at December 31, 2016$4571. Includes reductions in the accrual for payments made by indemnified parties. See below for further discussion.2. Excludes related indemnification asset. See below for further discussion.Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $900 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2016. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $457 million, that have an estimated liability of $250 million as of December 31, 2016 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $500 million above the amount accrued. As such, the company has recorded an indemnification asset of $250 million corresponding to the company's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2016. Within the table above, during 2016, the remediation payments made by Chemours are about $90 million and the indemnified portion of the net increase in the remediation accrual is about $50 million. On December 15, 2016, DuPont reached a settlement in principle, valued at about $50 million, with the U.S. Departments of Justice and the Interior and the Commonwealth of Virginia, to resolve remediation claims associated with mercury contamination in the South River and South Fork Shenandoah River watershed. If approved by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, the settlement requires DuPont to make a cash payment of about $42 million and undertake certain remediation activities. The full value of the settlement is included in the remediation accrual balance at December 31, 2016.As of December 31, 2016, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 100 sites for which DuPont does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 90 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 70 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at one new site during 2016 compared with one and three similar notices in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Environmental Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were $39 million in 2016. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be about $55 million in 2017. 49Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Climate Change The company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2010, as of 2015 the company reduced its environmental footprint, achieving reductions of 7.5 percent in GHG emissions, 7.6 percent in water consumption, and 3.3 percent in energy intensity from non-renewable resources versus a 2010 baseline. In 2015, the company announced its 2020 Sustainability Goals, including a goal to achieve a 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions intensity (2015 baseline) and continuation of its goal to achieve a 10 percent improvement in energy intensity (2010 baseline). The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy.The company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. However, the current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many company facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. In addition, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets. 50Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The company has established a variety of programs including use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks The company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the European euro (EUR), Chinese yuan, Brazilian real, and Japanese yen. The company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar (USD) amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Certain foreign entities of the company held USD denominated marketable securities, mainly US government securities, at December 31, 2015. The USD/EUR was the primary foreign exchange exposure for these nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities. These marketable securities were classified as “available-for-sale” and as such, fluctuations in foreign exchange were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) within the Consolidated Statements of Equity. These fluctuations were subsequently reclassified from AOCL to earnings in the period in which the marketable securities were sold. The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts and nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The sensitivities for foreign currency contracts and nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates. Fair ValueAsset/(Liability)Fair ValueSensitivity(Dollars in millions)2016201520162015Foreign currency contracts$61$(6)$(567)$(738)Marketable securities—788—(110)Since the company's risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure.Concentration of Credit Risk The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. As of December 31, 2016, no one individual customer balance represented more than five percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. 51Part II",2023-12-30 21:52:13.435354

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “target,” similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words.On December 11, 2015, The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“DuPont”) announced entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended on March 31, 2017, (the “Merger Agreement”) under which the companies would combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction (the “Merger”). Effective August 31, 2017, the Merger was completed and each of Dow and DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont Inc. (“DowDuPont”).Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to varying degrees, uncertain, including the intended separation, subject to approval of the DowDuPont Board of Directors, of DowDuPont’s agriculture, materials science and specialty products businesses in one or more tax efficient transactions on anticipated terms (the “Intended Business Separations”). Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events which may not be realized. Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of DuPont and its parent company. Some of the important factors that could cause DuPont’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) costs to achieve and achieving the successful integration of the respective agriculture, materials science and specialty products businesses of Dow and DuPont, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, productivity actions, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of the combined operations; (ii) costs to achieve and achievement of the anticipated synergies by the combined agriculture, materials science and specialty products businesses; (iii) risks associated with the Intended Business Separations, including conditions which could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the proposed transactions, including possible issues or delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals or clearances related to the Intended Business Separations, associated cost, disruptions in the financial markets or other potential barriers; (iv) disruptions or business uncertainty, including from the Intended Business Separations, could adversely impact DuPont’s business or financial performance and its ability to retain and hire key personnel; and (v) risks to DuPont’s business, operations and results of operations from: the availability of and fluctuations in the cost of energy and raw materials; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; ability, cost and impact on business operations, including the supply chain, of responding to changes in market acceptance, rules, regulations and policies and failure to respond to such changes; delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals, delayed product launches, lack of market acceptance, product discontinuation, changes in the regulatory environment and litigation resulting from concerns and claims regarding the safe use of seeds with biotechnology traits and crop protection products potential impact on health and the environment, and the perceived impacts of biotechnology on health and the environment; impact of unpredictable seasonal and weather factors could impact sales and earnings from agriculture products; outcome of significant litigation, environmental matters and other commitments and contingencies; failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; global economic and capital market conditions, including the continued availability of capital and financing, as well as inflation, interest and currency exchange rates; changes in political conditions, business or supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, natural disasters and weather events and patterns which could result in a significant operational event for DuPont, adversely impact demand or production; ability to discover, develop and protect new technologies and to protect and enforce the DuPont’s intellectual property rights; failure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio changes; unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. While the list of factors presented here is, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on DuPont’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, credit rating or liquidity. DuPont does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws. A detailed discussion of some of the significant risks and uncertainties which may cause results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).19Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Overview DowDuPont Merger of Equals On August 31, 2017 at 11:59 pm ET, (the ""Merger Effectiveness Time"") pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Dow and DuPont each merged with wholly owned subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the ""Mergers"") and, as a result of the Mergers, Dow and DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (collectively, the ""Merger"").DowDuPont intends to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the Board of Directors of DowDuPont, the separation of the combined company's agriculture business, specialty products business and materials science business through a series of tax efficient transactions (collectively, the ""Intended Business Separations""). DowDuPont anticipates materials science separating by the end of the first quarter of 2019, and expects agriculture and specialty products to separate by June 1, 2019. During the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company incurred $314 million and $581 million, respectively, of costs in connection with the Merger and the Intended Business Separations, including costs relating to integration and separation planning. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the company incurred $386 million and $10 million, respectively. These costs are recorded within integration and separation costs in the Successor period and the costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Predecessor periods within the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs have primarily consisted of financial advisory, information technology, legal, accounting, consulting and other professional advisory fees associated with the preparation and execution of activities related to the Merger and Intended Business Separations.See the discussion of this report entitled DowDuPont Merger of Equals under Part 1, Item 1 Business; Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors; and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details and a discussion of some of the risks related to the transaction.Results Net sales were $7.1 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $17.3 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, compared to $23.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $1.1 billion increase was primarily driven by 4 percent higher sales volume as worldwide local price and currency were flat. (Loss) income from continuing operations before taxes was $(1.6) billion, $1.8 billion and $2.7 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The period September 1 through December 31, 2017 results include $1.5 billion of amortization of inventory step-up, increased transaction costs related to the Merger and Intended Business Separations, higher depreciation related to the fair value step up of property, plant and equipment and lower gains from sales of businesses, partially offset by higher sales. Pension and other post employment benefits (""OPEB"") (benefits) costs for the period of September 1 through December 31, 2017 and January 1 through August 31, 2017 were $(83) million and $373 million, respectively, as compared to $222 million in 2016. Activity in the Successor period benefited from the absence of the amortization of net losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss (""AOCL""). Pension and OPEB costs for 2016 include a curtailment gain as a result of changes made to the U.S. Pension and OPEB benefits in 2016.20Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of OperationsNote on Financial PresentationIn connection with the Merger Transaction, the company applied the acquisition method of accounting as of September 1, 2017 and the financial statements reflect the preliminary related adjustments. As a result, financial information for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 (""Predecessor"") and the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 (""Successor"") are not comparable to the financial information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (""Predecessor""). In addition, the company has elected to make certain changes in presentation to harmonize its accounting and reporting with that of DowDuPont in the Successor period. See Note 1 for further discussion of these changes and Note 3 for additional information regarding the Merger Transaction.FMC TransactionsOn March 31, 2017, the company and FMC Corporation (""FMC"") entered into a definitive agreement (the ""FMC Transaction Agreement""). Under the FMC Transaction Agreement, FMC would acquire the crop protection business and R&D assets that DuPont was required to divest in order to obtain EC approval of the Merger Agreement, (the ""Divested Ag Business"") and DuPont agreed to acquire certain assets relating to FMC’s Health and Nutrition segment, excluding its Omega-3 products (the ""H&N Business"") (collectively, the ""FMC Transactions""). The sale of the Divested Ag Business meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, earnings are included within (loss) income from discontinued operations after income taxes for all periods presented.On November 1, 2017, the company completed the FMC Transactions through the disposition of the Divested Ag Business and the acquisition of the H&N Business. The preliminary fair value as determined by the company of the H&N Business is $1,970 million. The FMC Transactions include a cash consideration payment to DuPont of approximately $1,200 million, which reflects the difference in value between the Divested Ag Business and the H&N Business, as well as favorable contracts with FMC of $495 million, subject to adjustments for inventory of the Divested Ag Business and net working capital of the H&N Business. Due to the proximity of the Merger and the closing of the sale, the carrying value of the Divested Ag Business approximates the fair value of the consideration received, thus no resulting gain or loss was recognized on the sale. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the H&N Business.Tax ReformOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“The Act”) was enacted. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax (“transition tax”) on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, creates new provisions related to foreign sourced earnings, eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a territorial system. At December 31, 2017, the company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act; however, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded a net benefit in provision for income taxes on continuing operations of $2,001 million, which consisted of a provisional net benefit of $2,716 million due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate partially offset by a provisional charge of $715 million due to the transition tax. The company expects that it will have sufficient available foreign tax credits to offset the tax liability associated with the one-time transition tax. See Note 7 for additional information.DowDuPont Cost Synergy ProgramIn September and November 2017, DowDuPont and the company approved post-merger restructuring actions to achieve targeted cost synergies under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the “Synergy Program”), adopted by the DowDuPont Board of Directors. The plan is designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the Intended Business Separations. Based on all actions approved to date under the Synergy Program, DuPont expects to record total pre-tax restructuring charges of $430 million to $600 million. Additional details related to this plan can be found on page 3 of this report and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.On February 1, 2018, DowDuPont announced an increase in its cost synergy commitment from $3 billion to $3.3 billion.21Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2017 Restructuring ProgramDuring the first quarter 2017, DuPont committed to take actions to improve plant productivity and better position its product lines for productivity and growth before and after the anticipated closing of the Merger Transaction (the ""2017 restructuring program""). In connection with these actions, the company incurred pre-tax charges of $313 million during the period from January 1 through August 31, 2017 recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The charges primarily relate to the second quarter closure of the safety and construction product line at the Cooper River manufacturing site located near Charleston, South Carolina. The actions associated with this plan are substantially complete as of December 31, 2017. Additional details related to this plan can be found on page 3 of this report and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.2016 Global Cost Savings and Restructuring PlanOn December 11, 2015, DuPont announced a 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan designed to reduce $730 million in costs in 2016 compared with 2015. As part of the plan, the company committed to take structural actions across all product lines and staff functions globally to operate more efficiently by further consolidating product lines and aligning staff functions more closely with them. In connection with the restructuring actions, the company recorded a pre-tax charge to earnings of $783 million in the fourth quarter 2015, comprised of $641 million of severance and related benefit costs, $109 million of asset related charges, and $33 million of contract termination costs. The restructuring actions associated with the charge are substantially complete and the plan delivered the target cost reductions in 2016 versus 2015. Additional details related to this plan can be found on page 4 of this report and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Impact of 2017 Hurricanes In 2017 Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas and Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, both causing widespread damage. The financial impact related to the hurricanes, including lost sales and repairs and maintenance, is not material to the Predecessor or Successor financial statements.Separation of Performance Chemicals In October 2013, DuPont announced its intention to separate its Performance Chemicals segment through a U.S. tax-free spin-off to shareholders, subject to customary closing conditions. In July 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (Chemours).Settlement of PFOA MDLAs previously reported, approximately 3,550 lawsuits have been filed in various federal and state courts in Ohio and West Virginia alleging personal injury from exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt (""PFOA""), in drinking water as a result of the historical manufacture or use of PFOA at the Washington Works' plant outside Parkersburg, West Virginia. The plant operating units involved in the allegations are owned and operated by The Chemours Company (""Chemours""). These personal injury lawsuits were consolidated in multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (the ""MDL""). In February 2017, DuPont and plaintiffs’ counsel agreed to a settlement in principle of the MDL; the parties executed the definitive settlement agreements in March 2017. The total settlement amount is $670.7 million in cash, half of which was paid by Chemours and half by DuPont. The settlement was entered into solely by way of compromise and is not in any way an admission of liability or fault by DuPont or Chemours. The company recorded a pre-tax charge of $335 million ($214 million net of tax) to (loss) income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 for the remainder of the settlement not subject to indemnification by Chemours. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.22Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Net Sales2017 versus 2016Net sales were $7.1 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $17.3 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, compared to $23.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $1.1 billion increase was primarily driven by 4 percent higher sales volume. In Asia Pacific sales volume increased 10 percent primarily driven by the electronics and imaging product line and the transportation and advanced polymers product line. In EMEA sales volume increased 5 percent driven by the agriculture product line and the safety and construction product line. In U.S. and Canada net sales increased 1 percent, principally reflecting volume growth in the agriculture product line. In Latin America net sales increased 4 percent, driven by a positive currency impact due to stronger Brazilian real, as well as higher volume, partially offset by lower local prices. In the Consolidated Statement of Operations, royalty income is included within net sales in the Successor Period and is included in sundry income - net in the Predecessor Periods. Royalty income does not have a significant impact on any period presented. See Note 1 for further discussion of the changes in presentation.2016 versus 2015 Net sales of $23.2 billion in 2016 were 2 percent below prior year net sales of $23.7 billion, reflecting a 1 percent reduction due to currency and a 1 percent decrease due to lower local prices. Negative currency impact was primarily due to the weaker European euro, Mexican peso, and Chinese yuan, partly offset by the stronger Japanese yen and Brazilian real. Worldwide lower local prices primarily reflect reductions for the transportation and advanced polymers product line and the electronic and imaging product line, as well as flat prices in the agriculture product line. Worldwide volume was flat.

The increase was primarily driven by the amortization of the inventory step-up of $1.5 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 as well as higher sales volume, increased expenses due to the elimination of the other operating charges financial statement line item in the Successor period, higher depreciation related to the fair value step up of property, plant and equipment and higher pension and OPEB costs due to the curtailment gains recognized in 2016 as a result of the changes made to the U.S. Pension and OPEB benefits.COGS as a percentage of net sales was 87 percent, 59 percent, and 60 percent for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The amortization of the inventory step-up was 22 percent of net sales in the Successor period. The remaining COGS increase as a percentage of net sales in the Successor period is due to the items discussed above, partially offset with a pension and OPEB benefit as a result of the absence of the amortization of net losses from AOCL. The elimination of the other operating charges financial statement line item would have increased COGS as a percentage of net sales by 2 percent for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 3 for additional information regarding the Merger, including the valuation of inventory and see Note 1 for further discussion of the changes in presentation.23Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2016 versus 2015COGS decreased from $14.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $14.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by lower raw material costs, lower pension and OPEB costs, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus global currencies. COGS as a percentage of net sales decreased 2 percent, from 62 percent to 60 percent, principally due to lower raw material costs and lower pension and OPEB costs. Other Operating Charges2017 versus 2016Other operating charges were $667 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $504 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. In the Successor period, other operating charges are included primarily in cost of goods sold, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles. See Note 1 for further discussion of the changes in presentation.2016 versus 2015Other operating charges increased from $434 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $667 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by a $152 million decrease in Imprelis® herbicide insurance recoveries, and a $23 million reduction in the estimated liability related to Imprelis® herbicide claims versus a $130 million accrual reduction in the prior year.Research and Development Expense (""R&D"")2017 versus 2016R&D expense was $473 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $1,064 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $1,502 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily driven by an increase in R&D expense related to the agriculture product line and higher pension and OPEB costs due to the curtailment gains recognized in 2016 as a result of the changes made to the U.S. Pension and OPEB benefits in 2016, partially offset with lower costs related to the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program. R&D as a percentage of net sales was 7 percent, 6 percent, and 6 percent for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. R&D as a percentage of net sales is slightly higher in the Successor period, primarily due to an increase in R&D for new product introductions and higher depreciation, partially offset with a pension and OPEB benefit, cost savings, and the absence of amortization expense. 2016 versus 2015R&D expenses decreased from $1,735 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1,502 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower costs related to the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan, a decrease in pension and OPEB costs and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus global currencies. R&D as a percentage of net sales decreased 1 percent, from 7 percent to 6 percent, principally due to cost savings and lower pension and OPEB costs.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (""SG&A"")2017 versus 2016SG&A expenses were $1,101 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $3,306 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $4,143 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily driven by higher transaction costs, increased selling expense and commissions, primarily for agriculture products, higher compensation and higher pension and OPEB costs, partially offset with lower costs related to the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and the absence of amortization expense in the Successor period. In the Successor period, integration and separation costs and amortization of intangibles are presented as a line item on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 1 for further discussion of the changes in presentation. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company incurred $386 million and $581 million, respectively, of transaction costs in connection with the merger with Dow and the Intended Business Separations. 24Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 16 percent, 19 percent, and 16 percent for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Transaction costs were 3 percent and 2 percent of net sales for the period January through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining net sales increase as a percentage of net sales in the Successor period is due to the items discussed above.2016 versus 2015SG&A expenses decreased from $4,428 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $4,143 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $285 million decrease was primarily due to lower costs related to the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan, lower selling expense, and a decrease in pension and OPEB costs, partially offset by $386 million of transaction costs associated with the merger with Dow. SG&A expense as a percent of sales decreased by 1 percent, from 19 percent to 18 percent, primarily due to cost savings from the company’s 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and a decrease in pension and OPEB costs.Amortization of IntangiblesIntangible asset amortization was $389 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017. In the Predecessor periods, amortization of intangibles was included within SG&A other operating charges; R&D and COGS. See Note 3 for further information regarding the Merger, including the valuation of intangible assets. Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net2017 versus 2016Restructuring and asset related charges - net were $180 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $323 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $556 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The charge for period January 1 through August 31, 2017 is comprised of $279 million of asset-related charges and $44 million in severance and related benefit costs. The asset-related charges primarily relate to the second quarter closure of the safety and construction product line at the Cooper River manufacturing site located near Charleston, South Carolina as part of the 2017 restructuring program. For the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, DuPont recorded a pre-tax charge of $187 million, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $153 million, contract termination costs of $31 million and asset related charges of $3 million related to the Synergy program described below. This charge was partially offset by a $7 million benefit related to the 2016 and 2014 restructuring plans for adjustments to recognized severance costs. See Note 5 for additional information. In September and November 2017, DowDuPont and the company approved post-merger restructuring actions under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the “Synergy Program”), adopted by the DowDuPont Board of Directors. The plan is designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger. Based on all actions approved to date under the Synergy Program, DuPont expects to record total pre-tax restructuring charges of $430 million to $600 million, comprised of approximately $320 million to $360 million of severance and related benefits costs; $110 million to $140 million of costs related to contract terminations; and up to $100 million of asset related charges. The Synergy Program includes certain asset actions, including strategic decisions regarding the cellulosic biofuel unit reflected in the preliminary fair value measurement of DuPont’s assets as of the merger date. Current estimated total pre-tax restructuring charges could be impacted by future adjustments to the preliminary fair value of DuPont’s assets.Substantially all of the remaining restructuring charges are expected to be incurred in 2018 and the related actions, including employee separations, associated with this plan are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2019. Future cash payments related to this program are anticipated to be approximately $410 million to $480 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits and contract termination costs. It is possible that additional charges and future cash payments could occur in relation to the restructuring actions. The $556 million charge for 2016 consisted of $593 million of asset related charges (discussed in the “Asset Impairment” section, below) and a $68 million charge related to the decision to not re-start the company's insecticide manufacturing facility at the La Porte site located in La Porte, Texas. These charges were partially offset by a net $84 million benefit related to the 2016 restructuring plan, primarily due to a reduction in severance and related benefit costs driven by the elimination of positions at a lower cost than expected, and a $21 million benefit related to the 2014 restructuring plan for adjustments to the previously recognized severance costs.25Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2016 versus 2015 Restructuring and asset related charges - net decreased from $795 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $556 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The charges for 2016 are discussed above. The $795 million in charges recorded during 2015 in restructuring and asset related charges - net consist of a pre-tax charge of $783 million related to the 2016 restructuring plan, consisting of $778 million of restructuring and asset related charges - net and $5 million in sundry income - net. The charges consisted of $641 million in severance and related benefit costs, $109 million in asset related charges, and $33 million in contract termination charges. In addition, the company recognized a $38 million impairment charge discussed below, partly offset by a $21 million net benefit related to the 2014 restructuring plan. The $21 million net benefit was recorded to adjust the estimated costs associated with the 2014 restructuring program due to lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions achieved through non-severance programs, offset by the identification of additional projects.Asset Impairments During 2016, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of $435 million related to its uncompleted enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Given the uncertainties related to timing of completion as well as potential developments and changes to technologies in the market place at the time of restart, use of the ERP system can no longer be considered probable. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to this charge. During 2016, the company recorded a $158 million impairment charge related to indefinite-lived intangible trade names as a result of the realignment of brand marketing strategies and a determination to phase out the use of certain acquired trade names.During 2015, the company recorded an impairment charge of $38 million related to an impairment of a cost basis investment.Integration and Separation CostsIntegration and separation costs were $314 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017. In the Predecessor periods, integration and separation costs were included within SG&A. See Note 1 for further discussion of the changes in presentation. Sundry Income - Net2017 versus 2016Sundry income - net was $166 million and $90 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, respectively. Sundry income - net was $707 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The period September 1 through December 31, 2017, the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a net exchange gain of $8 million, a net exchange loss of $394 million and a net exchange loss of $106 million, respectively. The period January 1 through August 31, 2017 included a pre-tax gain of $162 million associated with the sale of the global food safety diagnostic business. The year ended December 31, 2016 included a pre-tax gain of $369 million associated with the sale of DuPont (Shenzhen) Manufacturing Limited entity.2016 versus 2015Sundry income - net increased from $690 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $707 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $17 million increase was primarily due to gains on sales of businesses and other assets, including a $369 million gain on the sale of DuPont (Shenzhen) Manufacturing Limited, partially offset by an increase in pre-tax exchange losses and the absence of a $145 million gain associated with the company's settlement of a legal claim in the prior year. Pre-tax exchange losses increased $136 million compared to prior year. See Notes 6 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Interest Expense2017 versus 2016Interest expense was $107 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $254 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $370 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily driven by amortization of the step-up of debt as a result of push-down accounting, partially offset by higher debt balances.26Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2016 versus 2015Interest expense increased from $342 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $370 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower capitalized interest related to construction projects partially offset by lower interest on borrowings. Provision for Income Taxes on Continuing Operations 2017 versus 2016For the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, the company’s effective tax rate of 168.5 percent on pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $1,586 million was favorably impacted by a provisional net benefit of $2,001 million that the company recognized due to the enactment of the Act, a net benefit of $261 million related to an internal legal entity restructuring associated with the Intended Business Separations, as well as geographic mix of earnings. Those impacts were partially offset by the non-tax deductible amortization of the fair value step-up in DuPont’s inventories as a result of the Merger, certain net exchange losses recognized on the remeasurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not tax deductible in their local jurisdictions, as well as the tax impact of costs associated with the merger with Dow and restructuring and asset related charges.For the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company’s effective tax rate was 8.3 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1,791 million. For the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company’s effective tax rate was favorably impacted by geographic mix of earnings, certain net exchange gains recognized on the remeasurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not taxable in their local jurisdictions, net favorable tax consequences of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, tax benefits related to a reduction in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits due to the closure of various tax statutes of limitations, as well as tax benefits on costs associated with the merger with Dow and restructuring and asset related charges. Those tax benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable tax consequences of non-deductible goodwill associated with the gain on the sale of global food safety diagnostics in the first quarter 2017.For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company’s effective tax rate of 23.5 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2,723 million was impacted by geographic mix of earnings as well as certain net exchange gains recognized on the remeasurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not taxable in their local jurisdictions. Those benefits were partially offset by the tax consequences of the gain on the sale of DuPont (Shenzhen) Manufacturing Limited in the first quarter 2016. 2016 versus 2015For the year ended December 31, 2015, the company’s effective tax rate of 28.4 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2,022 million was impacted by the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations as well as increased tax benefits on restructuring and asset related charges.Corporate OutlookNew products introductions in the agriculture product line are expected to contribute to growth in 2018. The company's 2018 results will be favorably impacted by the acquisition of the H&N Business. In 2018, the company expects income from continuing operations will be negatively impacted by the amortization of the inventory step-up, incremental amortization and depreciation related to the fair value step up of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, as well as transaction costs related to preparation for the Intended Business Separations, partially offset by realized synergy savings. A pension and OPEB benefit is expected in 2018 due to the absence of the amortization of net losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss. The company expects the US federal corporate tax rate reduction, from 35 percent to 21 percent, will have a positive impact on the 2018 effective tax rate.

The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows: Long-termShort-termOutlookStandard & Poor'sA-A-2StableMoody’s Investors ServiceA3P-2NegativeFitch RatingsAF1Rating Watch NegativeThe company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund its working capital, capital spending, debt maturities as well as distributions and other intercompany transfers to DowDuPont which relies on DuPont and Dow to fund payment of its costs and expenses. DuPont’s current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings continue to provide access as needed to the capital markets. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing, committed receivable repurchase facilities and asset sales.The company has access to approximately $6.7 billion in committed and uncommitted unused credit lines with several major financial institutions including unused commitments of $3 billion under the Term Loan Facility described below and a $3 billion revolving credit facility to support its commercial paper program. These unused credit lines provide support to meet the company's short-term liquidity needs and for general corporate purposes which may include funding of discretionary and non-discretionary contributions to certain benefit plans, severance payments, repayment and refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures and repurchases and redemptions of securities.In May 2017, the company completed an underwritten public offering of $1.25 billion of the company's 2.20 percent Notes due 2020 and $750 million of the company's Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (the ""May 2017 Debt Offering""). The proceeds of this offering were used to make a discretionary pension contribution to the company's principal U.S. pension plan, as discussed below. The company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations affecting manufacturing plants, mineral producing properties or research facilities located in the U.S. and the consolidated subsidiaries owning such plants, properties and facilities subject to certain limitations. The outstanding long-term debt also contains customary default provisions. In addition, the company will be required to redeem all of the Notes associated with the May 2017 Debt Offering at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest upon the announcement of the record date for the separation of either the agriculture or specialty products business, or the entry into an agreement to sell all or substantially all of the assets of either business to a third party.28Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In March 2016, the company entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (the ""Term Loan Facility"") under which DuPont may make up to seven term loan borrowings and amounts repaid or prepaid are not available for subsequent borrowings. The facility was amended in 2017 to extend the date on which the commitment to lend terminates to July 27, 2018. The proceeds from the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will be used for the company's general corporate purposes including debt repayment, working capital and funding a portion of DowDuPont's costs and expenses. The Term Loan Facility matures in March 2019, unless extended by mutual agreement, at which time all outstanding borrowings, including accrued but unpaid interest, become immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2017, the company had made three term loan borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion and had unused commitments of $3 billion under the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings and generally consistent with those applicable to DuPont’s long-term public debt. The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization for DuPont and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.6667. At December 31, 2017, the company was in compliance with this financial covenant.The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility impose additional affirmative and negative covenants on DuPont and its subsidiaries after the closing of the Merger, subject to certain limitations, including to:•not sell, lease or otherwise convey to DowDuPont, its shareholders or its non-DuPont subsidiaries, any assets or properties of DuPont or its subsidiaries unless the aggregate amount of revenues attributable to all such assets and properties so conveyed after the merger does not exceed 30 percent of the consolidated revenues of DuPont and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 (the Disposition Limitation); and•not guarantee any indebtedness or other obligations of DowDuPont, Dow or their respective subsidiaries (other than of DuPont and its subsidiaries).The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility will terminate, and the loans and other amounts thereunder would become due and payable, upon the sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the agriculture product line to DowDuPont, its shareholders or any of its non-DuPont subsidiaries.In January 2017, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $1.3 billion (the ""2017 Repurchase Facility"") which expired on November 30, 2017. Under the facility, the company sold a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables within the agriculture product line to participating institutions and simultaneously agreed to repurchase at a future date. In February 2018, the company entered into a new committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $1.3 billion (the ""2018 Repurchase Facility"") which expires on December 15, 2018. The 2018 Repurchase Facility has substantially similar terms and conditions as the 2017 Repurchase Facility and includes the 2017 Repurchase Facility change of control language conformed to the Disposition Limitation covenant described above. See further discussion of the 2018 Repurchase Facility in Item 9B, Other Information and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At the end of 2016, the company anticipated making contributions of approximately $230 million to its principal U.S. pension plan in 2017. During the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company made total contributions of $2.9 billion to its principal U.S pension plan, an increase of approximately $2.7 billion reflecting discretionary contributions. The discretionary contribution was funded through the May 2017 Debt Offering, as discussed above; short-term borrowings, including commercial paper issuance; and cash. The $2.9 billion contribution was taken as a deduction on the company’s 2016 federal tax return and resulted in a net operating loss for tax purposes. This loss resulted in an overpayment of taxes paid of approximately $800 million. A portion of the overpayment will be applied against the current year tax liability. The remainder of the loss generated a refund of approximately $700 million which was received during the fourth quarter of 2017. 29Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company entered into a trust agreement in 2013 (as amended and restated in 2017) that established and requires DuPont to fund a trust (the ""Trust"") for cash obligations under certain nonqualified benefit and deferred compensation plans upon a change in control event as defined in the Trust agreement. Under the Trust agreement, the consummation of the Merger was a change in control event. As a result, in November 2017, the company contributed $571 million to the Trust. In the fourth quarter of 2017, $13 million was distributed to the company according to the Trust agreement and at December 31, 2017, the balance in the Trust was $558 million.The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are $8.2 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, of which $7.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2016 was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a majority of which were previously considered permanently reinvested by the company (see Note 7 for further details of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. A deferred tax liability has been accrued for the estimated U.S. Federal tax on all unrepatriated earnings as of December 31, 2017 in accordance with the Act. At December 31, 2017, management believed that sufficient liquidity is available in the United States. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the Act on its permanent reinvestment assertion. In the event that additional foreign funds are needed in the United States, the company has the ability to repatriate additional funds. The repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. As such, it is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings.

Cash used for operating activities was $3.9 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, primarily driven by pension contributions of $3.0 billion, seasonal cash flows related to the agriculture product line, transaction costs and tax payments, partially offset by earnings. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to earnings offset by tax payments, pension contributions and transaction costs. Cash provided by operating activities increased $1.0 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a higher earnings contribution of approximately $0.5 billion, lower year-over-year income tax payments and lower working capital.

Cash used for investing activities was $2.4 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, primarily due to increased net purchases of investments, capital expenditures, payments for the acquisition of Granular and net payments from foreign currency contracts, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and businesses. Cash used for investing activities of $1.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to $1.0 billion of capital expenditures, net purchases of investments and net payments from foreign currency contracts, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and businesses. 30Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Cash used for investing activities in 2016 increased by $0.3 billion compared to 2015. The change was primarily due to lower purchases of property, plant and equipment, lower net purchases of marketable securities and higher proceeds from sales of product lines and other assets. This is partially offset by cash outflows relating to foreign currency contract settlements. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of marketable securities outstanding at December 31, 2016 and 2015.Capital expenditures totaled $0.7 billion and $0.4 billion for the periods from January 1 through August 31, 2017 and September 1 through December 31, 2017, respectively, $1.0 billion in 2016, and $1.6 billion in 2015. The company expects 2018 capital expenditures to be about $1.7 billion, of which approximately $0.5 billion is related to the targeted cost synergies associated with the Merger and execution of the Intended Business Separations. SuccessorPredecessor(Dollars in millions)For the Period September 1 through December 31, 2017For the Period January 1 through August 31, 201720162015Cash (used for) provided by financing activities$(3,227)$5,632$(2,385)$(1,929)Cash used for financing activities was $3.2 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, driven by a decrease in borrowings from commercial paper, distributions to DowDuPont and dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by increased borrowings under the Term Loan. Cash provided by financing activities was $5.6 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, driven by the May 2017 Debt Offering as well as increased borrowings from commercial paper, the Repurchase Facility, and the Term Loan Facility, partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders. Cash used for financing activities of $2.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 was driven by dividend payments to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, and repayments of long-term debt.The $0.5 billion increase in cash used for financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower borrowings as a result of the prior year distribution of approximately $3.9 billion which Chemours financed through external borrowings and paid to the company prior to its separation. This was partially offset by lower share repurchases and lower dividends paid to stockholders.Dividend payments to shareholders of DuPont common and preferred stock totaled $0.3 billion during the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, which includes the third quarter dividend declared for common stockholders of record July 31, 2017 and paid in September 2017. Dividend payments to shareholders of DuPont common and preferred stock totaled $0.7 billion during the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, $1.3 billion in 2016, and $1.5 billion in 2015. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.14 for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, $1.52 in 2016, and $1.72 in 2015.In the first quarter 2015, DuPont announced its intention to buy back about $4 billion of shares of DuPont common stock using the distribution proceeds received from Chemours. During 2015, the company purchased and retired 35 million shares of DuPont common stock through a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase (""ASR"") agreement and in 2016 purchased and retired 13.2 million shares in the open market at a cost of $916 million. As of the consummation of the Merger, shares of DuPont common stock held publicly were redeemed and DuPont's common stock is owned solely by its parent company, DowDuPont. DuPont's preferred stock remains issued and outstanding, and DuPont continues to be responsible for dividends on its preferred stock; however, the obligation is not material to the company's liquidity. Dividend payments to shareholders of DuPont preferred stock totaled $3 million during the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $7 million during the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, $10 million in 2016, and $10 million in 2015.DowDuPont relies on distributions and other intercompany transfers from DuPont and Dow to fund payment of its costs and expenses. In November 2017, DowDuPont’s Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend per share of DowDuPont common stock payable on December 15, 2017 and authorized an initial $4 billion share repurchase program to buy back shares of DowDuPont common stock. In the fourth quarter of 2017, DuPont declared and paid distributions in cash and in-kind to DowDuPont of $829 million, primarily to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s fourth quarter share repurchases and dividend payment. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the above share buyback plans.31Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Pension Plans and Other Post Employment BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other post employment benefit (""OPEB"") plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees.About 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's OPEB obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S. the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. Effective in 2016, the company began to measure the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The company made this change as it believes it is a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The company considers this a change in estimate, and, accordingly, has accounted for it on a prospective basis. This change does not affect the measure of the total benefit obligation. Historically, the service and interest cost components were estimated utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve and cash flow for measurement of the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. For non-U.S. benefit plans, the company utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets. In connection with pension contributions of $2,900 million to its principal U.S. pension plan for the period of January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, an investment policy study was completed for the principal U.S. pension plan. The study resulted in new target asset allocations for the U.S. pension plan with resulting changes to the expected return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 8.00 percent for the Predecessor period to 6.25 percent for the Successor period in 2017. 32Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan: SuccessorPredecessor(Dollars in billions)December 31, 2017 1December 31, 2016 1December 31, 2015Market-related value of assets$16.6$13.5$15.1Fair value of plan assets 16.713.514.41. During the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, the plan's trust fund paid approximately $140 million and $550 million, respectively, to a group of separated, vested plan participants who elected a limited-time opportunity to receive a lump sum payout. See further discussion under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 38.For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and OPEB plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)Successor(Dollars in millions)1/4 PercentagePointIncrease1/4 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$(34)$37Expected rate of return on plan assets49(49)Additional information with respect to pension and OPEB expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 38 and in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental MattersAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2017, the company had accrued obligations of $433 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $67 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to $900 million above that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.33Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Indemnification Assets On July 1, 2015, DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (the ""Separation""). In connection with the Separation, the company and The Chemours Company (""Chemours"") entered into a Separation Agreement (the ""Separation Agreement""). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement and the Amendment to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation, and other liabilities that arose prior to the separation. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the Separation Agreement and the Amendment to the Separation Agreement and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Income Taxes The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material.34Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted, making significant changes to the U.S. tax law (see Note 7 for further information). The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Act for which the accounting under Accounting Standards Codification 740 (“ASC 740”) is incomplete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate, it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. The provisional amounts, and adjustments identified in the measurement period, are recorded to the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in the period the amounts are determined. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (""SAB 118""), during the measurement period, income tax effects of the Act may be refined upon obtaining, preparing, or analyzing additional information, and such changes could be material. During the measurement period, provisional amounts may be also be adjusted for the effects, if any, of interpretative guidance issued after December 31, 2017, by U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies. SAB 118 provides that the measurement period is complete when a company's accounting is complete and in no circumstances, should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date. If a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before enactment of the Act. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the Act.At December 31, 2017, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $5.4 billion, net of valuation allowance of $1.4 billion. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.Valuation of Assets and Impairment Considerations The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified product lines operate, and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.The company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management. The company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. Subsequent to the Merger, the company identified nine reporting units.For purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.35Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In the predecessor period, the company completed the annual impairment test on July 1, 2017 when a quantitative assessment was performed on all reporting units that carry goodwill. Based on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test in the predecessor period, the company determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its reporting units is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. In connection with the Merger Transaction, the company adopted the policy of the parent company and performed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2017, a qualitative assessment was performed on all reporting units that carry goodwill. For the qualitative assessments, management considered the factors discussed above at both the company level and the reporting unit level. Based on the qualitative assessment, management concluded it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. As discussed below, the company’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the Merger, and as a result, any declines in projected cash flows could have a material, negative impact on the carrying value of the company's assets and therefore result in an impairment.Purchase AccountingDue to the Merger and the related accounting determination, DuPont has elected to apply the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that all assets and liabilities be remeasured to fair value as of the date of the Merger. Such fair values have been reflected in the company's financial statements following the push-down method of accounting. Estimates of fair value require a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the preliminary estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets and liabilities, as well as asset lives, have a material impact to the company's consolidated financial statements, and are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Third party valuation specialists were engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these assets and liabilities.36Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.Contractual Obligations Information related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In(Dollars in millions)Total atDecember 31, 201720182019-20202021-20222023 andbeyondLong-term debt and capital lease obligations1,2$11,113$1,286$5,010$1,507$3,310Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity2,6693855022751,507Operating leases 1,044264327185268Purchase obligations3 Information technology infrastructure & services16393646—Raw material obligations1,63053054652727Utility obligations1056623115Other9070128—Total purchase obligations1,98875964555232Other liabilities1,4 Pension and other post employment benefits 8,1394567787306,175Workers' compensation7813351515Environmental remediation4331461497167License agreements51,173230382316245Other626282453996Total other long-term liabilities10,0859271,3891,1716,598Total contractual obligations7$26,899$3,621$7,873$3,690$11,7151.

Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement.4. The company's contractual obligations do not reflect an offset for recoveries associated with indemnifications by Chemours in accordance with the Separation Agreement. Refer to Notes 4 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail related to the indemnifications.5. Represents undiscounted remaining payments under DuPont Pioneer license agreements ($1,079 million on a discounted basis). 6. Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other post employment benefits.7. Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations.37Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Long-term Employee BenefitsThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other post employment benefits or OPEB plans). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The company will freeze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans on November 30, 2018. Therefore, as of November 30, 2018, active employees participating in the U.S. pension plans will not accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received. In addition to the changes to the U.S. pension plans, OPEB eligible employees who will be under the age of 50 as of November 30, 2018 will not receive post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits. As a result of these changes, the company recognized a pre-tax curtailment gain of $382 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.In the fourth quarter 2016, about $550 million of lump-sum payments were made from the principal U.S. pension plan trust fund to a group of separated, vested plan participants who were extended a limited-time opportunity and voluntarily elected to receive their pension benefits in a single lump-sum payment. In the fourth quarter 2017, about $140 million of lump sum payments were made from the principal U.S. pension plan trust fund under a similar program. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company contributed $2,900 million to the principal U.S. pension plan for the period January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017. The company does not expect to make cash contributions to this plan in 2018. Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $34 million, $67 million, $121 million and $164 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $34 million, $57 million, $184 million and $144 million to its unfunded plans for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $59 million, $166 million, $218 million, and $237 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.In 2018, the company expects to contribute approximately $200 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan and its remaining plans with no plan assets, and about $250 million for its OPEB plans.38Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits: SuccessorPredecessor For the Period September 1 through December 31, 2017For the Period January 1 through August 31, 2017For the Year Ended December 31, 2016For the Year Ended December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Long-term employee benefit plan (benefit) charges 1$(12)$538$442$6161.The long-term employee benefit plan (benefit) charges include discontinued operations of $2 million, $8 million, $6 million and ($233) million for the periods September 1 through December 31, 2017 and January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.The above (benefit) charges for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. Activity for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 benefited from the absence of the amortization of net losses from AOCL. Long-term employee benefit expense in 2016 include a $382 million curtailment gain as a result of changes made to the U.S. Pension and OPEB benefits in 2016 described above. See ""Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 32 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.For 2018, long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations is expected to decrease by about $500 million. The decrease is mainly due to the absence of the amortization of net losses and prior service benefit from AOCL, which were $518 million during the period January 1 through August 31, 2017.39Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations are summarized below: SuccessorPredecessor(Dollars in millions)For the PeriodSep 1 - Dec 31, 2017For the PeriodJan 1 - Aug 31, 2017Dec 31, 2016Dec 31, 2015Environmental operating costs$85$205$335$346Environmental remediation costs8656266 $93$270$397$412About 66 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively, resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. 40Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Remediation Accrual Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2015 (Predecessor)$492Remediation payments(52)Net increase in remediation accrual 162Net change, indemnification 2(45)Balance at December 31, 2016 $457Remediation payments(53)Net increase in remediation accrual 165Net change, indemnification 214Balance at August 31, 2017$483 Balance at September 1, 2017 (Successor)483Remediation payments(40)Net increase in remediation accrual 18Net change, indemnification 2(18)Balance at December 31, 2017 $4331.Excludes indemnified remediation obligations.2.Net change in indemnified remediation obligations. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, as discussed below and in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, DuPont is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters.Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $920 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2017. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $433 million, that have an estimated liability of $242 million at December 31, 2017 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $430 million above the amount accrued. As such, the company has recorded an indemnification asset of $242 million corresponding to the company's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2017.As of December 31, 2017, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (""Superfund"") or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 100 sites for which DuPont does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at 62 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 200 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at 3 new sites during 2017 compared with single notices in both 2016 and 2015. Environmental Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were $18 million and $35 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $44 million in 2018.41Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Climate Change The company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. Expanding upon significant global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2010, in 2015, the company announced its 2020 Sustainability Goals, including a goal to achieve a 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions intensity (2015 baseline) and a 10 percent improvement in energy intensity (2010 baseline). As of 2016, the company achieved reductions of 1.3 percent in GHG emissions intensity against the goal baseline of 2015, and 8 percent since 2010. In addition, the company has achieved a 10.8 percent improvement in energy intensity since 2010. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy.The company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. However, the current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many company facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments.In addition, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets.42Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks The company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the European euro (EUR), Chinese yuan, Brazilian real, and Japanese yen. The company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar (USD) amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates.

These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. As of December 31, 2017, no one individual customer balance represented more than five percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global product lines.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region.43Part II",2023-12-30 21:52:13.093364

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “target,” similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words.Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to varying degrees, uncertain, including statements about the Intended Business Separations, the separations and distributions. Forward-looking statements, including those related to the ability of Historical DuPont, Historical Dow and DowDuPont to complete, or to make any filing or take any other action required to be taken to complete, the separations and distributions, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of Historical DuPont, Historical Dow and DowDuPont. Some of the important factors that could cause DowDuPont’s, Historical Dow’s or Historical DuPont’s actual results (including DowDuPont’s agriculture business, materials science business or specialty products business as conducted by and through Historical Dow and Historical DuPont) to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) ability and costs to achieve all the expected benefits, including anticipated cost and growth synergies, from the integration of Historical Dow and Historical DuPont and the Intended Business Separations, (either directly or as conducted through Historical Dow and Historical DuPont); (ii) the incurrence of significant costs in connection with the integration of Historical Dow and Historical DuPont and the Intended Business Separations; (iii) risks outside the control of DowDuPont, Historical Dow and Historical DuPont which could impact the decision of the DowDuPont Board of Directors to proceed with the Intended Business Separations, including, among others, global economic conditions, instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates, volatile foreign currency exchange rates, tax considerations, a full or partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government, and other challenges that could affect the global economy, specific market conditions in one or more of the industries of the businesses proposed to be separated, and changes in the regulatory or legal environment and the requirement to redeem $12.7 billion of DowDuPont notes if the Intended Business Separations are abandoned or delayed beyond May 1, 2020; (iv) potential liability arising from fraudulent conveyance and similar laws in connection with the separations and distributions; (v) disruptions or business uncertainty, including from the Intended Business Separations, could adversely impact financial performance and ability to retain and hire key personnel; (vii) potential inability to access the capital markets; and (viii) risks to DowDuPont’s, Historical Dow’s and Historical DuPont’s business, operations and results of operations from: the availability of and fluctuations in the cost of feedstocks and energy; balance of supply and demand and the impact of balance on prices; failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; ability, cost and impact on business operations, including the supply chain, of responding to changes in market acceptance, rules, regulations and policies and failure to respond to such changes; outcome of significant litigation, environmental matters and other commitments and contingencies; failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; global economic and capital market conditions, including the continued availability of capital and financing, as well as inflation, interest and currency exchange rates; changes in political conditions, including trade disputes and retaliatory actions; business or supply disruptions; security threats, such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, natural disasters and weather events and patterns which could result in a significant operational event, adversely impact demand or production; ability to discover, develop and protect new technologies and to protect and enforce intellectual property rights; failure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio changes; unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors. A detailed discussion of some of the significant risks and uncertainties which may cause results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).18Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Overview DowDuPont Merger of Equals DowDuPont Inc. (""DowDuPont"") was formed on December 9, 2015 to effect an all-stock, merger of equals strategic combination between The Dow Chemical Company (""Historical Dow"") and Historical DuPont (the ""Merger Transaction""). On August 31, 2017 at 11:59 pm ET, (the ""Merger Effectiveness Time"") pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Historical Dow and Historical DuPont each merged with wholly owned subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the ""Mergers"") and, as a result of the Mergers, Historical Dow and Historical DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (collectively, the ""Merger""). Prior to the Merger, DowDuPont did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Merger Agreement. DowDuPont intends to pursue, subject to the receipt of approval by the Board of Directors of DowDuPont and customary closing conditions, the separation of the combined company's agriculture business, specialty products business and materials science business through a series of tax-efficient transactions (collectively, the ""Intended Business Separations"" and the transactions to accomplish the Intended Business Separations, the “separations”). DowDuPont anticipates materials science separating about April 1, 2019, and expects agriculture and specialty products to separate about June 1, 2019. The Intended Business SeparationsDowDuPont has formed two wholly owned subsidiaries: Dow Holdings Inc., to serve as a holding company for its materials science business, and Corteva, Inc., to serve as a holding company for its agriculture business.In furtherance of the Intended Business Separations, DowDuPont is engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps (the “Internal Reorganization”) to realign its businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products. As part of the Internal Reorganization, the assets and liabilities aligned with the materials science business will be transferred or conveyed to legal entities that will ultimately be subsidiaries of Dow Holdings Inc. and the assets and liabilities aligned with the agriculture business will be transferred or conveyed to legal entities that will ultimately be subsidiaries of Corteva Inc. Following the Internal Reorganization, DowDuPont expects to distribute its materials science and agriculture businesses through two separate U.S. federal tax-free spin-offs in which DowDuPont stockholders, at the time of such spin-offs, will receive a pro rata dividend of the shares of the capital stock of Dow Holdings, Inc. and of Corteva, Inc., as applicable (the “distributions”). The materials science business after the consummation of the applicable Internal Reorganization will be referred to as “Dow” and the agriculture business after the consummation of the applicable Internal Reorganization will be referred to as “Corteva”. Following the separation and distribution of Dow, which is targeted to occur on April 1, 2019, DowDuPont, as the remaining company, will continue to hold the agriculture and specialty products businesses. DowDuPont is then targeted to complete the separation and distribution of Corteva on June 1, 2019, resulting in DowDuPont holding the specialty products businesses of the combined Company. After the distribution of Corteva, it is expected that DowDuPont will become known as DuPont (“DuPont”). Historical DuPont after the separations and distributions will hold the agriculture business and be a subsidiary of Corteva Inc. In November 2018, Historical DuPont entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility, (the “2018 Revolving Credit Facilities”). Availability of funds is subject to a number of conditions, including Corteva becoming a party to the 2018 Credit Revolving Facilities and the consummation of the separation and distribution of Corteva. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, the company incurred $1,375 million and $314 million, respectively, of costs in connection with the Merger and the Intended Business Separations, including costs relating to integration and separation planning. During the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, the company incurred $581 million and $386 million, respectively of costs in connection with the Merger and the Intended Business Separations, including costs relating to integration and separation planning. These costs are recorded within integration and separation costs in the Successor periods and the costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Predecessor periods within the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs have primarily consisted of financial advisory, information technology, legal, accounting, consulting and other professional advisory fees associated with the preparation and execution of activities related to the Merger and Intended Business Separations.See the discussion of this report entitled DowDuPont Merger of Equals under Part 1, Item 1 Business; Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors; and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details and a discussion of some of the risks related to the transaction.19Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Note on Financial PresentationIn connection with the Merger Transaction, the company applied the acquisition method of accounting as of September 1, 2017 and the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the related adjustments. Historical DuPont's Consolidated Financial Statements for periods following the close of the Merger are labeled “Successor” and reflect DowDuPont’s basis in the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Historical DuPont. All periods prior to the closing of the Merger reflect the historical accounting basis in Historical DuPont's assets and liabilities and are labeled “Predecessor.” The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements include a black line division between the columns titled ""Predecessor"" and ""Successor"" to signify that the amounts shown for the periods prior to and following the Merger are not comparable. In addition, the company has elected to make certain changes in presentation to harmonize its accounting and reporting with that of DowDuPont in the Successor periods. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these changes and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Merger Transaction. Results Net sales were $26.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $7.1 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and $17.3 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. The $1.9 billion increase was primarily driven by local pricing and portfolio gains across all regions. (Loss) income from continuing operations before taxes was $(4.8) billion, $(1.6) billion and $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the periods September 1 through December 31, 2017 and January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2018 results include a goodwill impairment charge of $4.5 billion, increased transaction costs related to the Merger and Intended Business Separations, higher amortization related to the fair value step up of other intangible assets, and higher depreciation related to the fair value step up of property, plant and equipment. These increased costs are partially offset by higher sales and benefits from cost synergies. Pension and other post employment benefits (""OPEB"") (benefits) costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $(228) million, as compared to $(83) million and $373 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. Activity in the Successor periods benefited from significantly lower amortization of net losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss (""AOCL""). Analysis of OperationsDowDuPont Contribution and Historical DuPont’s Offer to Purchase Debt Securities In contemplation of the Intended Business Separations and to achieve the respective credit profiles of each of the intended future companies, DowDuPont completed a series of financing transactions in the fourth quarter of 2018, which included an offering of senior unsecured notes and the establishment of new term loan facilities (the “financing transactions”). On November 13, 2018, Historical DuPont launched a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding debt securities (the “Tender Notes”). The Tender Offer expired on December 11, 2018 (the “Expiration Date”). At the Expiration Date, $4,409 million aggregate principal amount of the Tender Notes had been validly tendered and was accepted for payment. In exchange for such validly tendered Tender Notes, Historical DuPont paid a total of $4,849 million, which included breakage fees and all applicable accrued and unpaid interest on such Tender Notes. DowDuPont contributed cash (generated from its notes offering) to Historical DuPont to fund the settlement of the Tender Offer and payment of associated fees. Historical DuPont recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $81 million, primarily related to the difference between the redemption price and the par value of the notes, mostly offset by the write-off of unamortized step-up related to the fair value step-up of Historical DuPont’s debt. DowDuPont has announced its intent to use a portion of the remaining proceeds from the financing transaction to further reduce outstanding liabilities of Historical DuPont that would otherwise be attributable to Corteva. Agriculture Reporting Unit Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Asset ImpairmentsDuring the third quarter of 2018, the company was required to perform an interim impairment test of its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the agriculture reporting unit. As a result of the analysis performed, the company recorded pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of $4,503 million for goodwill and $85 million for certain indefinite-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2018. The charges were recognized in goodwill impairment charge and restructuring and asset related charges - net, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 20Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Impact From Recently Enacted Tariffs Certain countries where the company’s products are manufactured, distributed or sold have recently enacted or are considering imposing new tariffs on certain products. The tariffs contributed to an expected shift to soybeans from corn in Latin America and pressured North American farmer margins. These expectations were reflected in the revised long-term cash flow projections for the company's agriculture reporting unit, as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capacity Expansions Tyvek®In June 2018, Historical DuPont announced plans to invest more than $400 million in its safety and construction product line to increase capacity for the manufacture of Tyvek® nonwoven materials at its Luxembourg site due to growing global demand. The production expansion, which includes investment in a new building and a third operating line at the site, is scheduled to occur over the next three years, with commercial production expected to begin in 2021.Tax ReformOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“The Act”) was enacted. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax (“transition tax”) on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, creates new provisions related to foreign sourced earnings, eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a territorial system. As of December 31, 2018, the company had completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act. As a result of The Act, the company remeasured its U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent. The company recorded a cumulative benefit of $2,755 million ($2,716 million benefit during 2017 and $39 million benefit during 2018) to provision for (benefit from) income taxes on continuing operations in the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations with respect to the remeasurement of the company's deferred tax balances. Additionally, the company recorded a cumulative charge of $859 million ($715 million charge during 2017 and $144 million charge during 2018 to provision for (benefit from) income taxes on continuing operations with respect to the one-time transition tax. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, The Act introduced new provisions for U.S. taxation of certain global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). The Company has made the policy election to record any liability associated with GILTI in the period in which it is incurred. Additional details related to The Act can be found in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.DowDuPont Agriculture Division Restructuring ProgramDuring the fourth quarter of 2018 and in connection with the ongoing integration activities, DowDuPont approved restructuring actions to simplify and optimize certain organizational structures within the agriculture product line in preparation for the Intended Business Separations. As a result of these actions, Historical DuPont expects to record total pre-tax charges of approximately $65 million, comprised of approximately $55 million of severance and related benefits costs; $5 million of asset related charges, and $5 million of costs related to contract terminations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Historical DuPont recorded a pre-tax charge of $59 million, recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations comprised of $54 million of severance and related benefit costs and $5 million related to asset related charges. Future cash payments related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $60 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits and contract termination costs. The company expects actions related to this program to be substantially complete by mid-2019.DowDuPont Cost Synergy ProgramIn September and November 2017, DowDuPont and the company approved post-merger restructuring actions to achieve targeted cost synergies under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the “Synergy Program”), adopted by the DowDuPont Board of Directors. The Synergy Program is designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the Intended Business Separations. Based on all actions approved to date under the Synergy Program, Historical DuPont expects to record total pre-tax restructuring charges of $575 million to $675 million, comprised of approximately $370 million to $400 million of severance and related benefits costs; $80 million to $100 million of costs related to contract terminations; and $125 million to $175 million of asset related charges. The company anticipates including savings associated with these actions within DowDuPont's cost synergy commitment of $3.6 billion associated with the Merger Transaction.21Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued For the year ended December 31, 2018, Historical DuPont recorded a pre-tax charge of $322 million, of which $318 million was recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net and $4 million was recognized in sundry income (expense) - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. This charge consisted of severance and related benefit costs of $219 million, contract termination costs of $40 million and asset related charges of $63 million. For the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, Historical DuPont recorded a pre-tax charge of $187 million, recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. This charge consisted of severance and related benefit costs of $153 million, contract termination costs of $31 million and asset related charges of $3 million. Actions associated with the Synergy Program, including employee separations, are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2019. Additional details related to this plan can be found on page 25 of this report and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Future cash payments related to this program are anticipated to be approximately $255 million to $305 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits and contract termination costs. It is possible that additional charges and future cash payments could occur in relation to the restructuring actions. The company anticipates including savings associated with these actions within DowDuPont's cost synergy commitment of $3.6 billion associated with the Merger Transaction. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.2017 Restructuring ProgramDuring the first quarter 2017, Historical DuPont committed to take actions to improve plant productivity and better position its product lines for productivity and growth before and after the anticipated closing of the Merger Transaction (the ""2017 restructuring program""). In connection with these actions, the company incurred pre-tax charges of $313 million during the period from January 1 through August 31, 2017 recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The charges primarily relate to the second quarter closure of the safety and construction product line at the Cooper River manufacturing site located near Charleston, South Carolina. The actions associated with this plan were substantially complete as of December 31, 2017. Additional details related to this plan can be found on page 25 of this report and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.FMC TransactionsOn March 31, 2017, the company and FMC Corporation (""FMC"") entered into a definitive agreement (the ""FMC Transaction Agreement""). Under the FMC Transaction Agreement, and effective upon the closing of the transaction on November 1, 2017, FMC acquired the crop protection business and R&D assets that Historical DuPont was required to divest in order to obtain European Commission approval of the Merger Transaction, (the ""Divested Ag Business"") and Historical DuPont agreed to acquire certain assets relating to FMC’s Health and Nutrition segment, excluding its Omega-3 products (the ""H&N Business"") (collectively, the ""FMC Transactions""). The sale of the Divested Ag Business meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, earnings are included within (loss) income from discontinued operations after income taxes for all periods presented.On November 1, 2017, the company completed the FMC Transactions through the disposition of the Divested Ag Business and the acquisition of the H&N Business. The fair value as determined by the company of the H&N Business was $1,970 million. The FMC Transactions included a cash consideration payment to Historical DuPont of approximately $1,200 million, which reflects the difference in value between the Divested Ag Business and the H&N Business, as well as favorable contracts with FMC of $495 million. The carrying value of the Divested Ag Business approximated the fair value of the consideration received, thus no resulting gain or loss was recognized on the sale. Refer to Note 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Separation of Performance Chemicals On July 1, 2015, Historical DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company. In connection with the separation, the company and Chemours entered into a Separation Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement as well as certain ancillary agreements. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), the results of operations of its former Performance Chemicals segment are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are included within (loss) income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. Additional details regarding the separation and other related agreements can be found in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.22Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Settlement of PFOA MDLAs previously reported, approximately 3,550 lawsuits were consolidated in multi-district litigation (“MDL”); these lawsuits alleged personal injury from exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt (""PFOA""), in drinking water as a result of the historical manufacture or use of PFOA. The plant operating units involved in the allegations are owned and operated by The Chemours Company (""Chemours""). The MDL was settled in early 2017 for $670.7 million in cash, with Chemours and DuPont (without indemnification from Chemours) each paying half. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional informationNet Sales2018 versus 2017Net sales were $26.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $7.1 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $17.3 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. The $1.9 billion increase was primarily driven by local pricing gains across all regions, principally in the agriculture and transportation and advanced polymers product lines, as well as portfolio gains in the nutrition and health product line relating to the acquired H&N Business. Sales also increased on volume growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific.In the Consolidated Statement of Operations, royalty income is included within net sales in the Successor periods and is included in sundry income (expense) - net in the Predecessor periods. Royalty income does not have a significant impact on any period presented. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the changes in presentation.2017 versus 2016 Net sales were $7.1 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $17.3 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, compared to $23.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $1.1 billion increase was primarily driven by 4 percent higher sales volume. In Asia Pacific sales volume increased 10 percent primarily driven by the electronics and imaging product line and the transportation and advanced polymers product line. In Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA"") sales volume increased 5 percent driven by the agriculture product line and the safety and construction product line. In U.S. and Canada net sales increased 1 percent, principally reflecting volume growth in the agriculture product line. In Latin America net sales increased 4 percent, driven by a positive currency impact due to stronger Brazilian real, as well as higher volume, partially offset by lower local prices.

The increase was primarily driven by increased sales, the elimination of the other operating charges financial statement line item in the Successor periods, higher depreciation related to the fair value step-up of property, plant and equipment and increased raw material costs, specifically in the agriculture product line. The increase was also partially driven by the amortization of the inventory step-up of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $1.5 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017. 23Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued COGS as a percentage of net sales was 69 percent, 88 percent, and 58 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. The amortization of inventory step-up was 6 percent of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. The remaining COGS change as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to the items discussed above.See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Merger, including the valuation of inventory and see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the changes in presentation.2017 versus 2016COGS was $6.2 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $10.1 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 compared to $13.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the amortization of the inventory step-up of $1.5 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 as well as higher sales volume, increased expenses due to the elimination of the other operating charges financial statement line item in the Successor periods and higher depreciation related to the fair value step up of property, plant and equipment.COGS as a percentage of net sales was 88 percent, 58 percent, and 60 percent for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The amortization of the inventory step-up was 22 percent of net sales in the Successor periods. The remaining COGS increase as a percentage of net sales in the Successor periods is due to the items discussed above. The elimination of the other operating charges financial statement line item would have increased COGS as a percentage of net sales by 3 percent for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Merger, including the valuation of inventory and see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the changes in presentation.Other Operating Charges2017 versus 2016Other operating charges were $504 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and $667 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In the Successor periods, other operating charges are included primarily in cost of goods sold, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the changes in presentation.Research and Development Expense (""R&D"")2018 versus 2017R&D expense was $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, $492 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and $1 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. R&D expense remained flat as the increases in R&D expense for the agriculture product line related to investments to support new product launches and for the nutrition and health product line were offset by lower performance-based compensation. R&D as a percentage of net sales was 6 percent, 7 percent, and 6 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. 2017 versus 2016R&D expense was $492 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $1.0 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily driven by an increase in R&D expense related to the agriculture product line, partially offset with lower costs related to the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program. R&D as a percentage of net sales was 7 percent, 6 percent, and 6 percent for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. R&D as a percentage of net sales is slightly higher in the Successor periods, primarily due to an increase in R&D for new product introductions and higher depreciation, partially offset by cost savings and the absence of amortization expense. 24Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (""SG&A"")2018 versus 2017SG&A was $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, $1.1 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and $3.2 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. In the Successor periods, integration and separation costs and amortization of intangibles are presented as line items on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company incurred $581 million of transaction costs in connection with the Merger and the Intended Business Separations. The remaining change was primarily driven by increases in expense to support growth investments for new products in the agriculture and nutrition and health product lines, higher costs due to inclusion of a full year of results from the acquisition of the H&N Business from FMC, certain costs that are included in other operating charges for the Successor period, partially offset by cost synergies and by lower performance-based compensation. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the changes in presentation.SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 15 percent, 16 percent, and 19 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. Transaction costs were 3 percent of net sales for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. 2017 versus 2016SG&A was $1.1 billion for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $3.2 billion for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $4.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily driven by higher transaction costs, increased selling expense and commissions, primarily for agriculture products and higher compensation, partially offset with lower costs related to the 2016 global cost savings and restructuring plan and the absence of amortization expense in the Successor periods. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company incurred $386 million and $581 million, respectively, of transaction costs in connection with the Merger and the Intended Business Separations. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 16 percent, 19 percent, and 18 percent for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Transaction costs were 3 percent and 2 percent of net sales for the period January through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining net sales increase as a percentage of net sales in the Successor periods is due to the items discussed above.Amortization of Intangibles2018 versus 2017Intangible asset amortization was $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $389 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017. In the Predecessor periods, amortization of intangibles was included within SG&A other operating charges; R&D and COGS. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Merger, including the valuation of intangible assets. Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - NetRestructuring and asset related charges - net were $485 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, $180 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $323 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and $556 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 2018The activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 was related to a $318 million charge related to the Synergy Program, a $126 million of asset related charges (discussed in the ""Asset Impairment"" section, below), a $59 million charge related to the DowDuPont Agriculture Division Restructuring Program and an ($18) million benefit from reversals of prior year programs. 2017The charge for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 was primarily severance and related benefit costs as part of the Synergy Program. The charge for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 was comprised of $279 million of asset related charges and $34 million in severance and related benefit costs. The asset related charges primarily relate to the second quarter closure of the safety and construction product line at the Cooper River manufacturing site located near Charleston, South Carolina as part of the 2017 restructuring program. 25Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2016The $556 million charge for 2016 consisted of $593 million of asset related charges (discussed in the “Asset Impairment” section, below) and a $68 million charge related to the decision to not re-start the company's insecticide manufacturing facility at the La Porte site located in La Porte, Texas. These charges were partially offset by a net $84 million benefit related to the 2016 restructuring plan, primarily due to a reduction in severance and related benefit costs driven by the elimination of positions at a lower cost than expected, and a $21 million benefit related to the 2014 restructuring plan for adjustments to the previously recognized severance costs. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Asset ImpairmentFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the company recognized an $85 million pre-tax ($66 million after-tax) impairment charge in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations related to certain IPR&D assets within the agriculture reporting unit. See Notes 6 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.For the year ended December 31, 2018, management determined the fair values of investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in China were below the carrying values and had no expectation the fair values would recover. As a result, management concluded the impairment was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge of $41 million in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations, none of which is tax-deductible, for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Notes 6 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company recorded an asset impairment charge of $435 million related to its uncompleted enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") system. Given the uncertainties related to timing of completion as well as potential developments and changes to technologies in the market place at the time of restart, use of the ERP system can no longer be considered probable. Additionally, the company recorded a $158 million impairment charge related to indefinite-lived intangible trade names as a result of the realignment of brand marketing strategies and a determination to phase out the use of certain acquired trade names. See Notes 6 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to these charges. Integration and Separation Costs2018 versus 2017Integration and separation costs were $1,375 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $314 million in the period September 1 through December 31, 2017. In the Predecessor periods, integration and separation costs were included within SG&A. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the changes in presentation. The company expects Integration and separation costs to continue to be significant in 2019.Goodwill Impairment ChargeThe company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $4,503 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 related to an interim goodwill impairment test for its agriculture reporting unit. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company’s goodwill impairment charge.Sundry Income (Expense) - Net2018 versus 2017Sundry income (expense) - net was income of $543 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Sundry income (expense) - net was income of $667 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 charges are described above. The year ended December 31, 2016 included a pre-tax gain of $369 million associated with the sale of Historical DuPont (""Shenzhen"") Manufacturing Limited entity, royalty income of $170 million, a net exchange loss of $106 million and a non-operating pension and other post employment cost of $40 million. In the Successor periods, royalty income is included in net sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the changes in presentation.See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Loss on Early Extinguishment of DebtThe company recorded a loss from early extinguishment of debt of $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to the difference between the redemption price and the aggregate amount of the Tender Notes purchased in the Tender Offer, mostly offset by the write-off of unamortized step-up related to the fair value step-up of Historical DuPont’s debt. Additional information regarding the company’s Early Tender Settlement can be found on pages 20 and 29 of this report and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional.Interest Expense2018 versus 2017 Interest expense was $331 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, $107 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and $254 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. The change was primarily driven by amortization of the step-up of debt as a result of push-down accounting, partially offset by higher borrowing rates.2017 versus 2016Interest expense was $107 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $254 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $370 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily driven by amortization of the step-up of debt as a result of push-down accounting, partially offset by higher debt balances.Provision for Income Taxes on Continuing Operations 2018 For the year ended December 31, 2018, the company’s effective tax rate of (4.6) percent on pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $4,793 million was unfavorably impacted by the non-tax-deductible impairment charge for the agriculture reporting unit and corresponding $75 million tax charge associated with a valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset position of a legal entity in Brazil, costs associated with the Merger with Dow (including a $74 million net tax charge on repatriation activities to facilitate the Intended Business Separations), a $121 million net tax charge related to completing its accounting for the tax effects of the Act (see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail), and the impacts related to the non-tax-deductible amortization of the fair value step-up in DuPont’s inventories as a result of the Merger.2017For the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, the company’s effective tax rate of 168.5 percent on pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $1,586 million was favorably impacted by a provisional net benefit of $2,001 million that the company recognized due to the enactment of The Act, a net benefit of $261 million related to an internal legal entity restructuring associated with the Intended Business Separations, as well as geographic mix of earnings. Those impacts were partially offset by the non-tax deductible amortization of the fair value step-up in Historical DuPont’s inventories as a result of the Merger, certain net exchange losses recognized on the remeasurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not tax deductible in their local jurisdictions, as well as the tax impact of costs associated with the Merger with Historical Dow and restructuring and asset related charges.27Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued For the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company’s effective tax rate was 8.3 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1,791 million. For the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company’s effective tax rate was favorably impacted by geographic mix of earnings, certain net exchange gains recognized on the remeasurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not taxable in their local jurisdictions, net favorable tax consequences of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, tax benefits related to a reduction in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits due to the closure of various tax statutes of limitations, as well as tax benefits on costs associated with the Merger with Historical Dow and restructuring and asset related charges. Those tax benefits were partially offset by the unfavorable tax consequences of non-deductible goodwill associated with the gain on the sale of the global food safety diagnostic business in the first quarter of 2017.2016For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company’s effective tax rate of 23.5 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2,723 million was impacted by geographic mix of earnings as well as certain net exchange gains recognized on the remeasurement of the net monetary asset positions which were not taxable in their local jurisdictions. Those benefits were partially offset by the tax consequences of the gain on the sale of Historical DuPont (Shenzhen) Manufacturing Limited in the first quarter of 2016. 28Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. Liquidity & Capital Resources The company continually reviews its sources of liquidity and debt portfolio and occasionally may make adjustments to one or both to ensure adequate liquidity.(Dollars in millions)December 31, 2018December 31, 2017Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$4,500$8,202Total debt$7,972$13,070In the fourth quarter of 2018, Historical DuPont offered to purchase for cash approximately $6.2 billion of outstanding debt securities from each registered holder of the applicable series of debt securities (the “Tender Offers”). The company has retired $4.4 billion aggregate principal amount of such debt securities in connection with the Tender Offers, which expired on December 11, 2018. The retirement of these debt securities was funded with cash contributions from DowDuPont. In July 2018, Historical DuPont fully repaid $1,250 million of 6.0 percent coupon bonds at maturity.The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows: Long-termShort-termOutlookStandard & Poor'sA-A-2StableMoody’s Investors ServiceA3P-2StableFitch RatingsAF1StableThe company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund its working capital, capital spending, debt maturities in the ordinary course as well as distributions and other intercompany transfers to DowDuPont which relies primarily on Historical DuPont and Historical Dow to fund payment of its operating costs and expenses. Historical DuPont’s current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings continue to provide access as needed to the capital markets. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing, committed receivable repurchase facilities and asset sales.The company has access to approximately $6.1 billion in committed and uncommitted unused credit lines with several major financial institutions including unused commitments of $2.5 billion under the Term Loan Facility described below and a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility to support its commercial paper program. These unused credit lines provide support to meet the company's short-term liquidity needs and for general corporate purposes which may include funding of discretionary and non-discretionary contributions to certain benefit plans, severance payments, repayment and refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures and repurchases and redemptions of securities.In May 2017, the company completed an underwritten public offering of $1.25 billion of the company's 2.20 percent Notes due 2020 and $750 million of the company's Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (the ""May 2017 Debt Offering""). The proceeds of this offering were used to make a discretionary pension contribution to the company's principal U.S. pension plan, as discussed below. The company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations affecting manufacturing plants, mineral producing properties or research facilities located in the U.S. and the consolidated subsidiaries owning such plants, properties and facilities subject to certain limitations. The outstanding long-term debt also contains customary default provisions. In addition, the company will be required to redeem all of the Notes associated with the May 2017 Debt Offering at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest upon the announcement of the record date for the separation of either the agriculture or specialty products business, or the entry into an agreement to sell all or substantially all of the assets of either business to a third party.29Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In March 2016, the company entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (as amended, from time to time, the ""Term Loan Facility"") under which Historical DuPont may make up to seven term loan borrowings and amounts repaid or prepaid are not available for subsequent borrowings. The proceeds from the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility will be used for the company's general corporate purposes including debt repayment, working capital and funding a portion of DowDuPont's costs and expenses. The Term Loan Facility was amended in 2018 to extend the maturity date to June 2020, at which time all outstanding borrowings, including accrued but unpaid interest, become immediately due and payable, and to extend the date on which the commitment to lend terminates to June 2019. At December 31, 2018, the company had made four term loan borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion and had unused commitments of $2.5 billion under the Term Loan Facility. In addition, in 2018 the company amended its $3.0 billion revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date to June 2020.The Term Loan Facility and the amended revolving credit facility (the ""Facilities"") contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings and generally consistent with those applicable to Historical DuPont’s long-term public debt. The Facilities contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization for Historical DuPont and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.6667. At December 31, 2018, the company was in compliance with this financial covenant.The Facilities impose additional affirmative and negative covenants on Historical DuPont and its subsidiaries after the closing of the Merger, subject to certain limitations, including to:•not sell, lease or otherwise convey to DowDuPont, its shareholders or its non-Historical DuPont subsidiaries, any assets or properties of Historical DuPont or its subsidiaries unless the aggregate amount of revenues attributable to all such assets and properties so conveyed after the merger does not exceed 30 percent of the consolidated revenues of Historical DuPont and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015; and•not guarantee any indebtedness or other obligations of DowDuPont, Historical Dow or their respective subsidiaries (other than of Historical DuPont and its subsidiaries).The Facilities will terminate, and the loans and other amounts thereunder would become due and payable, upon the sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the agriculture product line to DowDuPont, its shareholders or any of its non-Historical DuPont subsidiaries.In February 2018, in line with seasonal agricultural working capital requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase agreement of up to $1.3 billion (the ""2018 Repurchase Facility"") which expired in December 2018. Under the 2018 Repurchase Facility, the company sold a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables within the agriculture product line to participating institutions and simultaneously agreed to repurchase at a future date. In February 2019, the company entered into a new committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $1.3 billion (the ""2019 Repurchase Facility"") which expires in December 2019. See further discussion of the 2019 Repurchase Facility in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.During the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, the company made total contributions of $2.9 billion to its principal U.S. pension plan, including approximately $2.7 billion reflecting discretionary contributions. The discretionary contribution was funded through the May 2017 Debt Offering, as discussed above; short-term borrowings, including commercial paper issuance; and cash. The $2.9 billion contribution was taken as a deduction on the company’s 2016 federal tax return and resulted in a net operating loss for tax purposes. This loss resulted in an overpayment of taxes paid of approximately $800 million. A portion of the overpayment was applied against the 2017 tax liability. The remainder of the loss generated a refund of approximately $700 million which was received during the fourth quarter of 2017. At the end of 2017, the company did not anticipate making contributions to its principal U.S. pension plan in 2018. The company made a discretionary contribution of $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2018 to its principal U.S. pension plan, primarily through cash balances. The decision to make the discretionary contribution took into account tax deductible limits as well as capital structure considerations.30Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company entered into a trust agreement in 2013 (as amended and restated in 2017) that established and requires Historical DuPont to fund a trust (the ""Trust"") for cash obligations under certain nonqualified benefit and deferred compensation plans upon a change in control event as defined in the Trust agreement. Under the Trust agreement, the consummation of the Merger was a change in control event. As a result, in November 2017, the company contributed $571 million to the Trust. In the fourth quarter of 2017, $13 million was distributed to Historical DuPont according to the Trust agreement and at December 31, 2017, the balance in the Trust was $558 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, $68 million was distributed to Historical DuPont according to the Trust agreement and at December 31, 2018, the balance in the Trust was $500 million. The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are $4.5 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, of which $3.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and $7.9 billion at December 31, 2017 was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. The decrease in cash held by subsidiaries in foreign countries is due to the repatriation activities discussed below. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The Act requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a majority of which were previously considered permanently reinvested by the company (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of The Act). A tax liability was accrued for the estimated U.S. federal tax on all accumulated unrepatriated earnings through December 31, 2017 in accordance with The Act (i.e., ""transition tax""). The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. At December 31, 2018, management believed that sufficient liquidity is available in the United States. The company has the ability to repatriate additional funds to the US, which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. It is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings due to the complexity of the hypothetical calculation. During 2018, in connection with the Intended Business Separations, the company repatriated certain funds from its non-U.S. subsidiaries that were not needed to finance local operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the company recorded net tax expense of $74 million associated with foreign withholding tax incurred in connection with these repatriation activities.

Cash used for investing activities was $2,382 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, primarily due to increased net purchases of investments, capital expenditures, payments for the acquisition of Granular and net payments from foreign currency contracts, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and businesses. Cash used for investing activities of $1,514 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to $1,019 million of capital expenditures, net purchases of investments and net payments from foreign currency contracts, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and businesses. Capital expenditures totaled $1,311 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, $426 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $687 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $1,019 million in 2016. The company expects 2019 capital expenditures to be about $1,800 million, of which approximately $500 million is related to the targeted cost synergies associated with the Merger and execution of the Intended Business Separations.

Cash used for financing activities was $3,227 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, primarily driven by a decrease in borrowings from commercial paper, distributions to DowDuPont and dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by increased borrowings under the Term Loan. Cash provided by financing activities was $5,632 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, primarily driven by the May 2017 Debt Offering as well as increased borrowings from commercial paper, the Repurchase Facility, and the Term Loan Facility, partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders. Cash used for financing activities of $2,385 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by dividend payments to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, and repayments of long-term debt.Dividend payments to shareholders of Historical DuPont common and preferred stock totaled $0.3 billion during the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $0.7 billion during the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $1.3 billion in 2016. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.14 for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 and $1.52 in 2016.In the first quarter 2015, Historical DuPont announced its intention to buy back about $4.0 billion of shares of Historical DuPont common stock using the distribution proceeds received from Chemours. During 2016, the company purchased and retired 13.2 million shares in the open market at a cost of $916 million. As of the consummation of the Merger, shares of Historical DuPont common stock held publicly were redeemed and Historical DuPont's common stock is owned solely by its parent company, DowDuPont. Historical DuPont's preferred stock remains issued and outstanding, and Historical DuPont continues to be responsible for dividends on its preferred stock; however, the obligation is not material to the company's liquidity. Dividend payments to shareholders of Historical DuPont preferred stock totaled $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, $3 million during the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, $7 million during the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and $10 million in 2016.32Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued DowDuPont primarily relies on distributions and other intercompany transfers from Historical DuPont and Historical Dow to fund payment of its operating costs and expenses. In November 2017, DowDuPont’s Board of Directors (the ""Board"") declared a fourth quarter dividend per share of DowDuPont common stock payable on December 15, 2017 and authorized an initial $4 billion share repurchase program to buy back shares of DowDuPont common stock. The $4 billion share repurchase program was completed in the third quarter of 2018. In 2018, the Board declared and paid quarterly dividends per share of DowDuPont common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, Historical DuPont declared and paid distributions in cash to DowDuPont of about $2,806 million and $829 million, respectively, primarily to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s share repurchases and dividend payments for these periods.See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the above Historical DuPont share buyback plan.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Pension Plans and Other Post Employment BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and OPEB plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive.About 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's OPEB obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S., the discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. The company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For non-U.S. benefit plans, historically the company utilized prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. For the 2018 measurement date, the company adopted the Aon AA corporate bond rates to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country.33Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets. In connection with pension contributions of $2,900 million to its principal U.S. pension plan for the period of January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, an investment policy study was completed for the principal U.S. pension plan. The study resulted in new target asset allocations for the U.S. pension plan with resulting changes to the expected return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 8.00 percent for the Predecessor period to 6.25 percent for the Successor periods in 2017.In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. Generally, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months, however, as a result of the Merger, for the Successor periods, the market-related value of assets was calculated by averaging market returns from September 1, 2017 through the respective year ends.The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan: SuccessorPredecessor(Dollars in billions)December 31, 2018December 31, 2017 1December 31, 2016 1Market-related value of assets$16.6$16.6$13.5Fair value of plan assets 15.716.713.51. During the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, the plan's trust fund paid approximately $140 million and $550 million, respectively, to a group of separated, vested plan participants who elected a limited-time opportunity to receive a lump sum payout. See further discussion under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 40.For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and OPEB plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2018:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/4 PercentagePointIncrease1/4 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$(31)$32Expected rate of return on plan assets48(48)Additional information with respect to pension and OPEB expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 40 and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.34Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Environmental MattersAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2018, the company had accrued obligations of $381 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $54 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (""PRPs"") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to $750 million above that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Indemnification Assets On July 1, 2015, Historical DuPont completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (the ""Chemours Separation""). In connection with the Chemours Separation, the company and Chemours entered into a Separation Agreement (as amended, the ""Chemours Separation Agreement""). Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours against certain litigation, environmental, workers' compensation, and other liabilities that arose prior to the separation. The term of this indemnification is indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these indemnified matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the Chemours Separation Agreement and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. 35Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Income Taxes The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.At December 31, 2018, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $5.1 billion, net of a valuation allowance of $1.1 billion. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.Valuation of Assets and Impairment ConsiderationsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified product lines operate, and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its diverse portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.The company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. Subsequent to the Merger, the company identified nine reporting units, of which eight have goodwill assigned. In connection with the Merger Transaction, the company adopted the policy of the parent company and performs its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter. 36Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued For purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.If additional quantitative testing is required, the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge, if any, is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The company determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the income approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and includes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on its most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts. The company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in the company’s reporting unit valuations ranged from 7.25% to 13.75%.Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. The company’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the Merger, and as a result, any declines in projected cash flows or increases in discount rates could have a material, negative impact on the fair value of the company's reporting units and assets and therefore result in an impairment. During the third quarter of 2018, and in connection with strategic business reviews, the company assembled updated financial projections. The revised financial projections of the agriculture reporting unit assessed and quantified the impacts of developing market conditions, events and circumstances that have evolved throughout 2018, resulting in a reduction in the forecasts of sales and profitability as compared to prior forecasts. The reduction in financial projections was principally driven by lower growth in sales and margins in North America and Latin America and unfavorable currency impacts related to the Brazilian real. The lower growth expectation is driven by reduced planted area, an expected unfavorable shift to soybeans from corn in Latin America, and delays in expected product registrations. In addition, decreases in commodity prices and higher than anticipated industry grain inventories are expected to impact farmers’ income and buying choices resulting in shifts to lower technologies and pricing pressure. The company considered the combination of these factors and the resulting reduction in its forecasted projections for the agriculture reporting unit and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of the agriculture reporting unit was less than the carrying value, thus requiring the performance of an updated goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis for the agriculture reporting unit as of September 30, 2018. 37Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company performed an interim impairment analysis for the agriculture reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach), utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs. The company’s significant estimates in this analysis include, but are not limited to, future cash flow projections, Merger-related cost and growth synergies, the weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate, and the tax rate. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. The key assumption driving the change in fair value was the lower financial projections discussed above. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from the company’s estimates. If the company’s ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met, the company may have to record additional impairment charges in future periods. The company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and planned business strategy. These estimates could be negatively affected by changes in federal, state, or local regulations or economic downturns. Based on the analysis performed, the company determined that the carrying amount of the agriculture reporting unit exceeded its fair value resulting in a $4.5 billion pre-tax (and after-tax) goodwill impairment charge. The company also performed an impairment test on indefinite-lived intangibles and determined that the fair value of certain IPR&D assets had declined as a result of delays in timing of commercialization and increases to expected R&D costs. This resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $85 million ($66 million after-tax). The assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair values of this reporting unit and its indefinite-lived intangibles contain uncertainties, and any changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a negative impact and result in a future impairment. For further information see Notes 6, 14 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In the fourth quarter of 2018, quantitative testing was performed on all of the company’s reporting units. Based on the results of the step one testing, the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. Due to the fair value and carrying value of these reporting units being equal at the date of the Merger resulting in little, if any, margin of fair value in excess of carrying value, the company believes these reporting units are at risk to have impairment charges in future periods. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified product lines operate, and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors, circumstances and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized.The company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles by reporting unit at December 31, 2018 is shown below (in millions):Reporting UnitGoodwillIndefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsAgriculture$8,849$8,663Electronics and Imaging4,056495Safety and Construction 5,512260Nutrition and Health8,7421,424Transportation and Advanced Polymers6,366310Packaging and Specialty Plastics3,587—Industrial Biosciences3,113399Clean Tech461—Total$40,686$11,55138Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Prepaid RoyaltiesThe company’s agriculture product line currently has certain third party biotechnology trait license agreements, which require up-front and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions. These payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the life of the license. At December 31, 2018, the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was $239 million and $1,139 million, respectively. The company evaluates the carrying value of the prepaid royalties when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the prepaid royalties and the rate of royalty amortization expense recognized are based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio, market dynamics, farmer preferences, growth rates and projected planted acres. Changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans, including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology, could impact the recoverability and/or rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.Contractual ObligationsInformation related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In(Dollars in millions)Total atDecember 31, 201820192020-20212022-20232024 andbeyondLong-term debt and capital lease obligations1,2$6,033$295$4,988$409$341Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity53218911740186Operating leases 65524221811085Purchase obligations3 Information technology infrastructure & services765323——Raw material obligations1,74657075938136Utility obligations793422149Other8153199—Total purchase obligations1,98271082340445Other liabilities1,4 Pension and other post employment benefits 7,0324297511,6624,190Workers' compensation7010251322Environmental remediation3811421217147License agreements591122033626293Other627688533798Total other long-term liabilities8,6708891,2862,0454,450Total contractual obligations7$17,872$2,325$7,432$3,008$5,1071.

The company's contractual obligations do not reflect an offset for recoveries associated with indemnifications by Chemours in accordance with the Chemours Separation Agreement. Refer to Notes 4 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail related to the indemnifications.5. Represents undiscounted remaining payments under Historical DuPont Pioneer license agreements ($806 million on a discounted basis). 6. Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other post employment benefits.7. Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. 39Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Long-term Employee BenefitsThe company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other post employment benefits or ""OPEB"" plans). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans on November 30, 2018. Therefore, as of November 30, 2018, employees participating in the U.S. pension plans no longer accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received. In addition to the changes to the U.S. pension plans, OPEB eligible employees who will be under the age of 50 as of November 30, 2018 will not receive post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits. As a result of these changes, the company recognized a pre-tax curtailment gain of $382 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.In the fourth quarter 2016, about $550 million of lump-sum payments were made from the principal U.S. pension plan trust fund to a group of separated, vested plan participants who were extended a limited-time opportunity and voluntarily elected to receive their pension benefits in a single lump-sum payment. In the fourth quarter of 2017, about $140 million of lump-sum payments were made from the principal U.S. pension plan trust fund under a similar program.Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations of the sovereign country in which the pension plan operates. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs.The company contributed $2,900 million and $1,100 million to the principal U.S. pension plan for the period January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, and the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively. The company contributed $103 million, $34 million, $67 million and $121 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $105 million, $34 million, $57 million and $184 million to its unfunded plans for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.The company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $216 million, $59 million, $166 million, and $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.40Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In 2019, the company expects to contribute approximately $190 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan and its remaining plans with no plan assets, and about $240 million for its OPEB plans. The company does not expect to make contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2019. The amount and timing of actual future contributions will depend on applicable funding requirements, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors, including the Internal Reorganization, separations and distributions.The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution charges/(benefits) as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income for the year ended December 31, 2018, for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, and for the year ended December 31, 2016 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits: SuccessorPredecessor For the Year Ended December 31, 2018For the Period September 1 through December 31, 2017For the Period January 1 through August 31, 2017For the Year Ended December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions)Long-term employee benefit plan charges (benefit) 1$6$(12)$538$4421.The long-term employee benefit plan charges (benefit) include discontinued operations of $2 million, $8 million and $6 million for the periods September 1 through December 31, 2017 and January 1 through August 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.The above charges (benefit) for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. Activities for the period ended December 31, 2018 and for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 benefited from the absence of the amortization of net losses from AOCL. Long-term employee benefit expense in 2016 include a $382 million curtailment gain as a result of changes made to the U.S. Pension and OPEB benefits in 2016 described above. See ""Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 33 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.For 2019, long term employee benefit expense from continuing operations is expected to increase by about $30 million. The increase is mainly due to lower expected return on plan assets.41Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations are summarized below: SuccessorPredecessor(Dollars in millions)For the Year Ended December 31, 2018For the Period September 1 through December 31, 2017For the Period January 1 through August 31, 2017For the Year Ended December 31, 2016Environmental operating costs$240$85$205$335Environmental remediation costs5886562 $298$93$270$397About 66 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. 42Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Remediation Accrual Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2016 (Predecessor)$457Remediation payments(53)Net increase in remediation accrual 165Net change, indemnification 214Balance at August 31, 2017$483 Balance at September 1, 2017 (Successor)483Remediation payments(40)Net increase in remediation accrual 18Net change, indemnification 2(18)Balance at December 31, 2017$433Remediation payments(61)Net increase in remediation accrual 158Net change, indemnification 2(49)Balance at December 31, 2018$3811.Excludes indemnified remediation obligations.2.Represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from Historical DuPont's accrued remediation liabilities of obligations that have been fully transferred to Chemours. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement, as discussed below and in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Historical DuPont is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters.Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $750 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2018. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company is indemnified by Chemours for certain environmental matters, included in the liability of $381 million, that have an estimated liability of $193 million at December 31, 2018 and a potential exposure that ranges up to approximately $310 million above the amount accrued. As such, the company has recorded an indemnification asset of $193 million corresponding to the company's accrual balance related to these matters at December 31, 2018.As of December 31, 2018, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (""Superfund"") or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 100 sites for which Historical DuPont does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at 69 of the 500 sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 200 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at 2 new sites during 2018 compared with 3 notices in 2017 and 1 in 2016. Environmental Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were $29 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $55 million in 2019.43Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Climate Change The company believes that climate change is an important global issue that presents risks and opportunities. For instance, the company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. The company also manages and reports its operational resource efficiency. Expanding upon significant greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and other environmental footprint reductions made in the period 1990-2010, in 2015, the company announced its 2020 Sustainability Goals, including a goal to achieve a 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions intensity (2015 baseline) and a 10 percent improvement in energy intensity (2010 baseline). While the company's 2017 GHG intensity held relatively flat with its 2015 goal baseline, the company has achieved a 12.7 percent reduction in GHG intensity since 2010. In addition, the company has achieved a 14.9 percent improvement in non-renewable energy intensity since 2010. The company is actively engaged in efforts to develop constructive public policies to reduce GHG emissions and encourage lower-carbon forms of energy. Such policies may bring higher operating costs as well as greater revenue and margin opportunities. Legislative efforts to control or limit GHG emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. Similarly, demand is expected to grow for products that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. However, the current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., where many company facilities are located, adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions, particularly those relating to long-term capital investments.In addition, significant differences in regional or national approaches could present challenges in a global marketplace. An effective global climate policy framework will help drive the market changes that are needed to stimulate and efficiently deploy new innovations in science and technology, while maintaining open and competitive global markets.44Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks The company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the European euro (""EUR""), Chinese yuan, Brazilian real, and Japanese yen. The company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar (""USD"") amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency.

These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service Historical DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. As of December 31, 2018, no one individual customer balance represented more than five percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global product lines.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region.45Part II",2023-12-30 21:52:14.397350

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management’s Discussion and Analysis: Analysis of Continuing Operations 14-17 Discontinued Operations 17 Segment Reviews 17-29 Further to the Agriculture & Nutrition Segment discussion in Exhibit 13 on pages 18-20: Glyphosate Tolerant Soybeans In December 1999, the Monsanto Company filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against Pioneer claiming that its merger with DuPont breached a 1992 license agreement granting Pioneer the right to produce and market Roundup Ready® glyphosate tolerant soybeans. Monsanto asked for damages for the breach and termination of the license. Monsanto’s complaint also alleged claims for patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation if the license were terminated. On March 20, 2001, the court, on motions for summary judgment, found that DuPont’s acquisition of Pioneer terminated the agreement. The court found no breach of contract and therefore, awarded no damages on this claim. It held that any claim for damages or other relief Monsanto seeks will have to wait until the next phase of the litigation, which involves Monsanto’s patent infringement and trade secret allegations. 13 Table of Contents The court found that its determination involved controlling questions of law as to which there is a substantial difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal would advance the ultimate determination of this litigation. Those questions involve whether federal common law or state merger law should control the transferability of patent licenses. The court has certified its decision for immediate appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Pioneer has filed an appeal. The company believes that the appellate court will ultimately find that state merger law rather than federal common law controls in merger situations and, therefore, that no prohibited license transfer took place when DuPont acquired Pioneer. The district court has stayed all other proceedings regarding patent infringement and trade secret claims pending the outcome of the appeal. A favorable decision for Pioneer on appeal will reinstate the license and preclude all other claims. The appeal was heard on February 5, 2002. A decision is not expected until later in 2002. On October 1, 1999, the company acquired the approximately 80 percent of Pioneer not previously owned for $7,684 million. An intangible asset has been recorded to recognize the value of the 1992 license agreement. Should the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit be adverse to the company, the value of this intangible asset may become impaired, resulting in a one-time noncash charge to earnings. Management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations, although it could be significant to the results of operations of the Agriculture & Nutrition segment in the period recognized.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company’s strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures and financial results are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events. The company cannot guarantee that these assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. For some of the important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 9. Overview DuPont continues to successfully employ its three growth strategies — Putting Science to Work, Leveraging the Power of One DuPont and Going Where the Growth Is — by leveraging resources through its five growth platforms: Agriculture & Nutrition, Coatings & Color Technologies, Electronic & Communication Technologies, Performance Materials and Safety & Protection. The company’s sixth reportable segment, Pharmaceuticals, continues to receive substantial income from two anti-hypertension (AIIA) drugs, Cozaar® and Hyzaar®, developed by DuPont and licensed to Merck. By successfully executing its three growth strategies, DuPont expects to achieve over the long term, annual financial targets of 6 percent revenue growth, 10 percent earnings growth in earnings per share and 1 percentage point improvement in Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). In 2006, sales increased 3 percent, diluted earnings per share increased 63 percent and ROIC increased 7 percentage points. Putting Science to Work — Science is the basis for the capabilities, offerings and competitive advantages of the company’s businesses. The company’s research and development programs are focused on creating new technologies, processes and business opportunities in relevant fields, as well as improving existing products and processes. Market-driven innovation, which relies on the voice of the customer and concrete market opportunities, is central to the company’s research efforts. In 2006 over 1,000 new products were commercialized, 1,800 new U.S. patent applications were filed and more than one third of 2006 sales were derived from products introduced in the last 5 years. The company is focused on prioritizing deployment of research resources to the most promising opportunities and is aggressively filing patent applications to protect the intellectual property created by that research. The company has identified the top 75 technology projects expected to generate commercial success and continues to prioritize programs for faster and larger payoffs. Leveraging the Power of One DuPont — The company’s strategy is to increase productivity and leverage market access, capabilities and customers, with a single focus, thereby creating wider opportunities for its businesses. In late 2005, management committed to intensify cost and capital productivity efforts by adjusting capital and resources allocation among its businesses. By doing so, management expects to reduce fixed costs as a percentage of sales and increase ROIC. Target reductions of $1 billion in costs and $1 billion in working capital savings over a three year period starting in 2006, were set to partially offset cost increases from inflation and desired growth investments. Management exceeded its goal for fixed cost savings in 2006 by reducing fixed costs by approximately $170 million, or approximately 2 percentage points as a percentage of sales. In addition, the company continued to take actions to standardize and simplify its supply chains and support functions globally and improve its sales effectiveness. 19 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Going Where the Growth Is — The company has achieved significant growth in emerging markets by increasing its direct presence and sales efforts including extending the company’s science, products, brands and market position into new applications and uses. The company has a strong presence in the fastest-growing emerging markets and continues to leverage resources and market position to realize new growth. Sales outside of North America, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Japan have increased to 36 percent of total company sales in 2006 from 33 percent in 2004. Analysis of Operations During 2006, the company maintained a leading position in biotechnology, safety and protection and crop yield improvement and continued to execute its growth strategies, while overcoming record-high energy costs. Management estimates that year over year cost increases for raw materials in 2006 exceeded $800 million, principally reflecting higher market prices for oil, natural gas and hydrocarbon feedstock and overall tight supply in certain raw materials. The company took actions to increase pricing and improve productivity to offset these cost increases, particularly in the Agriculture & Nutrition and Coatings & Color Technologies platforms where the company initiated restructuring actions to streamline operations and further reduce fixed costs. The company’s operations have completely recovered from hurricane disruptions of 2005. The most significant damage was to the company’s DeLisle, Mississippi, titanium dioxide plant which remained shut down from August 2005 until production began a phased-in restart in January 2006. Normal operations resumed by the end of the second quarter 2006. In 2006, the company received $204 million in insurance recoveries related to losses suffered from Hurricane Katrina and asbestos settlements; $128 million is recorded in Cost of goods sold and other operating charges and $76 million is recorded in Other income, net. The company adopted a dual approach to quantifying materiality and elected to refine the accounting related to the following existing cutoff practices. For certain of the company’s sales transactions, ownership title transfers when goods are received by the customers. Historically, the company recorded these sales when shipped and monitored the impact of this difference. Additionally, some accruals were historically recorded on a month-lag basis. The impacts of these sales and accrual cutoff practices were considered to be immaterial in every interim and annual period. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the company chose to change its practices to record these sales when received by customers and to record certain accruals without a lag. As a result, sales of $107 million were not recorded as of December 31, 2006 that historically would have been. If the company had applied this new practice throughout 2006, sales would have been $81 million higher than reported. Incremental accruals of $24 million were also recorded at December 31, 2006, that would not have been recorded under prior practices. The after-tax impact on the 2006 income statement of these changes was $39 million. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 NET SALES $ 27,421 $ 26,639 $ 27,340 2006 versus 2005 Consolidated net sales for 2006 were $27.4 billion, up 3 percent. The increase reflects 2 percent higher local selling prices and 2 percent higher net volume partially offset by a 1 percent reduction in worldwide sales attributable to the transfer of certain elastomers assets in 2005. Local selling prices increased across all regions. During 2006, significant volume increases in key growth regions, particularly Asia Pacific and Latin America, along with modest growth in Europe, more than offset lower U.S. volume. Volume declines in the U.S. are largely attributable to lower demand in motor vehicle and residential housing related markets. These declines more than offset the recovery in the U.S. of titanium dioxide, industrial chemical and packaging polymer sales lost in 2005 due to hurricane business interruption. 20 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2006 Consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year: Percent Percent Change Due to: 2006 Change vs. Currency (Dollars in billions) Net Sales 2005 Local Price Effect Volume Other1 Worldwide $ 27.4 3 2 — 2 (1) United States 11.1 — 3 — (1 ) (2) Europe 7.9 3 2 (1 ) 3 (1) Asia Pacific 4.8 5 3 (2 ) 7 (3) Canada & Latin America 3.6 10 2 3 5 — 1 Percentage change due to the absence in 2006 of sales from elastomers businesses transferred to Dow on June 30, 2005. Sales attributable to the transferred assets were $386 million in 2005. 2005 versus 2004 Consolidated net sales for 2005 were $26.6 billion, down 3 percent. The 2004 sale of INVISTA resulted in a $2.1 billion or 8 percent reduction in Net sales. This reduction was partly offset by a 6 percent increase in sales resulting from 5 percent higher local selling prices and 1 percent favorable currency effect. In 2005, growth in key markets, particularly those in Asia Pacific and Latin America, helped offset the reduction in U.S. volumes. Volume declines in the U.S. and Europe were related to lower demand in motor vehicle and production agriculture markets and the impact of the 2005 hurricanes. The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2005 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year: Percent Percent Change Due to: 20052 Change vs. Currency (Dollars in billions) Net Sales 2004 Local Price Effect Volume Other1 Worldwide $ 26.6 (3 ) 5 1 (1 ) (8 ) United States 11.1 (4 ) 6 — (2 ) (8 ) Europe 7.7 (4 ) 3 2 (3 ) (6 ) Asia Pacific 4.5 (4 ) 5 1 2 (12 ) Canada & Latin America 3.3 9 4 6 4 (5 ) 1 Percentage changes in sales due to the absence of $2.1 billion in sales attributable to the divested Textiles & Interiors business in 2004. 2 Sales related to elastomers businesses transferred to Dow on June 30, 2005, were $386 million and $467 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. Excluding these sales, the company’s worldwide sales were $26.2 billion in 2005, down 2 percent from 2004 with volume essentially flat. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 OTHER INCOME, NET $ 1,561 $ 1,852 $ 655 2006 versus 2005 Other income decreased $291 million versus 2005. This reduction is primarily due to a $407 million decrease in net pretax exchange gains (see page 54 for a discussion of the company’s program to manage currency risk and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The company records royalty income related to its licenses for Cozaar®/Hyzaar® in Other income. Licensing income related to these products was $815 million and $747 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. 21 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued In 2006, the company recorded $76 million of insurance recoveries in Other income from its insurance carriers. Of this amount, $61 million related to costs, including outside counsel fees and expenses and settlements paid over the past twenty years as part of asbestos litigation matters. During this twenty year period, DuPont has been served with thousands of lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to asbestos on DuPont premises. Most of these claims have been disposed of through trial, dismissal or settlement. Management believes it is remote that the outcome of remaining or future asbestos litigation matters will have material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity. These asbestos related insurance recoveries are reflected in Cash provided by operating activities within the company’s Statements of Cash Flows. The remaining $15 million is part of a total recovery of $143 million relating to insurance recoveries associated with damages to the company’s facilities suffered as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The majority of the Hurricane Katrina recovery is included in Cost of goods sold and other operating charges in the Consolidated Income Statement; additional recoveries are not expected to be material. No amounts are expected to be received from insurance carriers for damages suffered by the company as a result of Hurricane Rita. 2005 versus 2004 Other income increased $1,197 million versus 2004. The increase is primarily due to net pretax exchange gains in 2005 of $423 million compared to losses in 2004 of $391 million (see page 54 for a discussion of the company’s program to manage currency risk and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Royalty income related to the licenses for Cozaar®/Hyzaar® was $747 million and $675 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Equity in the earnings of affiliates increased $147 million over 2004, primarily due to the absence of a $150 million elastomers antitrust litigation charge in the DuPont Dow Elastomers LLC (DDE) joint venture recorded in 2004 (discussed in detail in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES $ 20,440 $ 19,683 $ 20,827 As a percent of Net sales 75% 74% 76% 2006 versus 2005 Cost of goods sold and other operating charges (COGS) for the year 2006 were $20.4 billion, versus $19.7 billion in 2005, up 4 percent. COGS was 75 percent of sales versus 74 percent in the prior year. The 1 percentage point increase in COGS as a percent of sales principally reflects higher raw material costs not entirely covered by selling price increases and higher costs for restructuring plans discussed below. In 2006, the company recorded a benefit to COGS for $128 million for insurance recoveries related to the property damage suffered as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In 2005, the company recorded a charge of $160 million related to the clean-up and restoration of manufacturing operations, as well as the write-off of inventory and plant assets that were destroyed by two major hurricanes in the U.S. Hurricane charges reduced segment earnings as follows: Coatings & Color Technologies — $116 million; Performance Materials — $17 million; and Safety & Protection — $27 million. In 2006, restructuring plans were introduced within the Coatings & Color Technologies and the Agriculture & Nutrition segments. These programs include the elimination of approximately 3,200 positions and redeployment of about 400 employees in excess positions to the extent possible. The company recorded a net charge of $326 million in 2006 related to employee separation costs and asset impairment charges. This included $184 million to provide severance benefits for approximately 2,800 employees involved in manufacturing, marketing and sales, administrative and technical activities. The company also recorded a benefit of $6 million in 2006 resulting from changes in estimates for prior years’ restructuring programs. Additional details related to these programs are contained in the individual segment reviews and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Payments from operating cash flows to terminated employees as a result of the 2006 plans total about $28 million during the current year. The remainder will be substantially paid during 2007. Annual pretax cost savings of about $135 million per year are associated with the Coatings & Color Technologies program. Approximately 35 percent was realized in 2006. An additional 50 percent is expected in 2007, with the remainder expected to be realized in 2008. A substantial portion of the Agriculture & Nutrition program involves reinvestment in research and development activities so cost savings are largely neutral under this plan. In 2005, the company evaluated capital investment requirements at its Louisville, Kentucky facility and the declining demand for the neoprene products produced at the facility. As a result, the company has made plans to consolidate neoprene production at its upgraded facility in LaPlace, Louisiana, which is now expected to be completed by the end of 2007. A charge of $34 million was recorded in 2005 reflecting severance and related costs for approximately 275 employees, principally at the Louisville site. Additionally, a benefit of $13 million was recorded in 2005 to reflect changes in estimates related to employee separations that were implemented in earlier years. 2005 versus 2004 COGS for the year 2005 was $19.7 billion, a decrease of $1,144 million from the prior year. 2005 COGS includes a $160 million hurricane charge, a $34 million charge and a $13 million benefit related to employee separations discussed above. 2004 COGS included a $108 million litigation charge related to PFOA and a charge of $118 million related to elastomers antitrust litigation (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). COGS also included employee separation costs and asset impairment charges in 2004 of $411 million as described below. As a percent of sales, COGS was 74 percent in 2005 versus 76 percent in 2004. The improvement principally reflects the changes in employee separation costs and the sale of INVISTA, which had higher COGS in relation to sales than the rest of the company, partly offset by raw material costs that escalated at a higher rate than the increases in selling prices. A modestly favorable effect of currency translation offset a small decrease in sales volumes. COGS in 2004 includes a net charge of $411 million in 2004 related to employee separation costs and asset impairment charges as a result of actions taken in that year to ensure the company’s global competitiveness as a more focused, science-based company. This included $302 million to provide severance benefits for approximately 2,700 employees involved in manufacturing, marketing and sales, administrative and technical activities. Essentially all of these employees were separated as of December 31, 2005. These staff reductions affected essentially all segments. The company also recorded a benefit of $12 million in 2004 resulting from changes in estimates for prior years’ restructuring programs. In addition, the company recorded impairment charges of $121 million in 2004 which included: $27 million to reflect an other than temporary decline in the value of an investment security; $23 million related to the shutdown of U.S. manufacturing assets; $42 million related to the write down of certain European manufacturing assets; and $29 million to write off abandoned technology. Payments from operating cash flows to terminated employees as a result of the 2004 plan total about $300 million. Approximately 44 percent of these cash outlays were made in 2004, 45 percent were made in 2005 and the remainder in 2006 and thereafter. Annual pretax cost savings of about $225 million per year are associated with the 2004 restructuring plan. About 40 percent was realized in 2004 and essentially all the remaining savings in payroll costs were realized in 2005. Over 50 percent of the savings associated with the staff reductions are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses, approximately 30 percent in COGS and other operating charges and the balance in Research and development expense. 23 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $ 3,224 $ 3,223 $ 3,141 As a percent of Net sales 12% 12% 11% Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $1 million and remained constant as a percent of sales in 2006 as compared to 2005. In 2005, SG&A expenses increased $82 million. The 1 percentage point increase as a percent of sales primarily reflects the absence of INVISTA in 2005, which had lower selling expenses as a percent of sales compared to the rest of the company. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE $ 1,302 $ 1,336 $ 1,333 As a percent of Net sales 5% 5% 5% Research and development expense as a percent of sales remained constant over the three-year period. Expenditures in 2006 were consistent with spending by segment in 2005 and reflect concentration in expansion of seed traits, breeding advancement and product development within Agriculture & Nutrition, as well as activities to support the growth platforms. Spending in 2005 reflects increases across most segments, offset by the absence of spending in Textiles & Interiors after April 30, 2004. The company continues to support a strong commitment to research and development as a source of sustainable growth and expects research and development funding to increase modestly in 2007. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 INTEREST EXPENSE $ 460 $ 518 $ 362 Interest expense decreased $58 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to lower average borrowing level partially offset by higher average rates. An increase in the average interest rates from 3.46 percent to 4.60 percent and a 3 percent higher average borrowing level resulted in the increase in interest expense for 2005 as compared to 2004. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 SEPARATION ACTIVITIES — TEXTILES & INTERIORS — $ (62 ) $ 667 On April 30, 2004, the company sold a majority of the net assets of Textiles & Interiors, referred to as INVISTA, to Koch. In January 2006, the company sold its interest in a Textiles & Interiors equity affiliate to its equity partner for proceeds of $14 million thereby completing the sale of all of the net assets of Textiles & Interiors. During 2005, the company sold its investments in three affiliated companies to Koch and its investment in a fourth affiliated company to its equity partner. The divestiture activities resulted in a net benefit of $62 million and the transfer of the company’s interest in the affiliates to Koch resulted in a gain of $35 million. The sale of two of these affiliates had been delayed until the company received approval from its equity partners. Although the transfer of these affiliates completed the sale to Koch, the company will have significant continuing involvement with INVISTA as a result of long-term purchase and supply contracts and a long-term contract manufacturing agreement in which INVISTA will manufacture and supply certain products for the company. In addition, the company indemnified Koch against certain liabilities, primarily related to taxes, legal matters, environmental matters and representations and warranties (see Note 20 to the Consolidated 24 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Financial Statements). The company’s total indemnification obligation for the majority of the representations and warranties can not exceed approximately $1.4 billion. The company also recorded a gain of $29 million in 2005 related to the sale of the company’s investment in another equity affiliate and $2 million of other charges associated with the separation. Net cash proceeds from these transactions totaled $135 million. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the charges that were recorded in 2004. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES $ 196 $ 1,470 $ (329 ) Effective income tax rate 5.9% 41.3% (22.8)% In 2006, the company recorded a tax provision of $196 million which included a benefit of $272 million related to tax settlements and a $186 million benefit for reversal of tax valuation allowances related to the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries due to the sustained improved business performance in these subsidiaries. These tax benefits were offset by net tax expense in other operating results (see note 7 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2005, the company recorded a tax provision of $1,470 million which included $483 million of tax expense on exchange gains associated with the company’s policy of hedging the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations and $292 million of tax expense related to the repatriation of $9.1 billion under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations provided that repatriated cash from such accumulated earnings is reinvested in the U.S. pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan. In 2004, the company recorded significant tax benefits which principally included $360 million on exchange losses in connection with the company’s foreign currency hedging program, $320 million related to the separation of Textiles & Interiors, $160 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year audit issues previously reserved and $137 million resulting from recording deferred tax assets in two European subsidiaries for tax basis investment losses recognized on local tax returns. These tax benefits were partly offset by net tax expense on other operating results. The company’s current estimate of the 2007 effective income tax rate is about 27 percent, excluding tax effects of exchange gains and losses which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on items that significantly impact the company’s effective tax rates. In the past three years, these items have generally included a lower effective tax rate on international operations, tax settlements and valuation allowance releases.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries in 2005 reflects earnings in the first half of 2005 for DDE and the absence of minority interests in subsidiaries transferred to Koch. Minority interests in losses of consolidated subsidiaries in 2004 reflect the consolidation of DDE as a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) in April 2004. 25 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 NET INCOME $ 3,148 $ 2,056 $ 1,780 2006 versus 2005 Net income for 2006 increased 53 percent versus 2005, reflecting higher selling prices, higher sales volumes, lower fixed costs and an increase in other income, partly offset by higher raw material costs. Selling prices increased year over year in each quarter of 2006 and were higher for each region for the full year. Net income also includes benefits from tax settlements, reversals of tax valuation allowances and insurance recoveries. These benefits were partly offset by charges for restructuring and asset impairments. 2005 results include significant hurricane related charges as well as tax expenses associated with the repatriation of cash under AJCA. Earnings per share were $3.38 in 2006 versus $2.07 in 2005, a 63 percent increase. This increase includes a 10 percentage point benefit from lower shares outstanding resulting from shares purchased by the company under its accelerated share repurchase program. 2005 versus 2004 Net income for 2005 increased 16 percent over 2004. 2005 Net income reflects higher selling prices which essentially offset record increases in raw material costs and higher fixed costs. In addition, 2005 results include significant hurricane related charges as well as tax expenses associated with the repatriation of cash under the AJCA. In contrast, 2004 results were adversely affected by even greater charges resulting from a corporate restructuring program, losses on the separation of Textiles & Interiors and charges for certain elastomers antitrust matters and litigation related to PFOA. Earnings per share were $2.07 in 2005 versus $1.77 in 2004, a 17 percent increase. This includes a 2 percentage point benefit in 2006 from lower shares outstanding resulting from the accelerated share repurchase program. Corporate Outlook Overall, economic conditions are expected to be less favorable in 2007 than in 2006, with growth expected to slow in every region of the world. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in developed countries is forecast to slow to below-trend rates, while growth in the developing world will be near trend with about 5 percent growth in South America to 9 percent in China. Global industrial production, which is considered a reliable indicator of demand for the company’s products and services, is forecast to expand about 3 percent in 2007 versus about 4.5 percent in 2006 and will exhibit a regional trend similar to GDP. Sales volume is expected to be up across the growth platforms, with the largest increases in Electronic & Communication Technologies, Safety & Protection and Agriculture & Nutrition. The 2007 average value of the U.S. dollar is forecast to be slightly weaker than the 2006 average. This should have a beneficial impact on sales and income from operations outside of the U.S. and increase demand for the company’s exported products. Raw material costs are expected to remain relatively consistent with 2006. While prices for both oil and natural gas moderated somewhat during the second half of 2006, futures markets indicate increases in both during 2007 averaging somewhat higher than 2006 prices. Fixed costs as a percent of sales are expected to be lower than in 2006, reflecting the company’s continued strong productivity efforts. Other income is forecast to be lower in 2007 reflecting reduced income from Pharmaceuticals and lower licensing income in Agriculture & Nutrition. Based on these expectations, management estimates that earnings per share will be about $3.15 in 2007, with Net sales of about $29 billion. Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109), “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 will be adopted by the company on January 1, 2007. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, the company used a 26 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued different measurement attribute to account for uncertainty in income taxes. While the company is still evaluating the impact of adoption of FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements, it believes that adoption of FIN 48 will decrease the liabilities accrued for uncertainty in income taxes at December 31, 2006, by $100 million to $125 million with a corresponding increase in reinvested earnings at January 1, 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), “Fair Value Measurements,” which addresses how companies should measure fair value when required for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). The standard’s provisions will be applied to existing accounting measurements and related disclosures, that are based on fair value. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard applies a common definition of fair value to be used throughout GAAP, with emphasis on fair value as a “market-based” measurement versus an entity-specific measurement and establishes a hierarchy of fair value measurement methods. The disclosure requirements are expanded to include the extent to which companies use fair value measurements, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The new standard’s provisions applicable to the company will be applied prospectively and the company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring reserves, environmental matters and litigation. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company’s accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions at least annually. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan obligations or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining working life of current employees. About 80 percent of the company’s benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company’s other postretirement benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. The company utilizes published long-term high quality bond indices to determine the discount rate at the balance sheet date. Where commonly available, the company considers indices of various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments. 27 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy and projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than their fair value. Accordingly, there tends to be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair market value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company’s calculation of net pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair market value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan. (Dollars in billions) 2006 2005 Market-related value of assets $ 17.5 $ 15.9 Fair market value of plan assets 18.3 16.6 For other plans, pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets. The fair value of assets in all pension plans was $22 billion at December 31, 2006, and the related projected benefit obligations were $23 billion. In addition, obligations under the company’s unfunded other postretirement benefit plans were $4 billion at December 31, 2006. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company’s pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2006: 1/2 Percentage 1/2 Percentage (Dollars in millions) Point Increase Point Decrease Discount rate $ 78 $ (89 ) Expected rate of return on plan pension assets 103 (103 ) Additional information with respect to pension and other postretirement employee expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under “Long-Term Employee Benefits” beginning on page 47. Environmental Matters DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company’s estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. The company has recorded a liability of $349 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued. Much of this liability results from the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, often referred to as the Superfund), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and similar state laws. These laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where 28 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. Federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations and could, among other things, impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company-generated waste disposal. Over the next two decades, the company could incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of PRPs. Therefore, it is difficult to develop accurate estimates of future site remediation costs. Legal Contingencies The company’s results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement claims and antitrust claims. The company records reserves for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these reserves to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company’s experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter’s current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation reserve when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The breadth of the company’s operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the ultimate taxes the company will pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company’s tax assets and tax liabilities. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material. 29 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued At December 31, 2006, the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of $1,778 million, net of valuation allowance of $1,259 million. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. Valuation of Assets Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other purchased intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of long-lived assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. Future changes in the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges. Information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on long-lived assets is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Reviews Segment sales include transfers and a pro rata share of equity affiliates’ sales. Segment pretax operating income (PTOI) is defined as operating income before income taxes, minority interests, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses, interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated Net sales and segment PTOI to Income before income taxes and minority interests for 2006, 2005 and 2004 is included in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2006 $ 6.3 $ 507 2005 6.4 862 2004 6.2 769 Agriculture & Nutrition leverages the company’s technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply. Global land area that can be used in agricultural production is increasingly limited. Therefore, increases in production will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted acreage. Agriculture & Nutrition delivers a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. The segment operates across the food value chain from inputs for production agriculture to global production and distribution of soy-based food ingredients, food quality diagnostic testing equipment and services and liquid food packaging systems. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and enhance the value of grains and soy through improved seed traits, superior germplasm and the effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. 30 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Agriculture & Nutrition includes the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer, which is also the world’s leading seed brand and a world leader in improving crop yields with hybrid and varietal seeds that improve grower yields and provide insect protection and herbicide tolerance. The principal products of Pioneer are hybrid seed corn and soybean seed. In 2006, farmers in North America continued to demonstrate a preference for corn hybrids containing biotechnology traits and Pioneer had limited supplies of these products. As a result, corn market share in North America declined slightly. In soybeans, Pioneer increased market share in key segments supported by strong product performance. Pioneer benefited from the global launch of 22 new soybean varieties and 90 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids that include new combinations of corn borer, corn rootworm and weed management traits highlighted by the expansion of the Herculex®1 family of traits. Agriculture & Nutrition also serves the global production agriculture industry with crop protection products in the grain and specialty crop sectors, forestry and vegetation management. Principal crop protection products are herbicides, fungicides, insect control products and plant growth regulators. Sales of crop protection products declined modestly in 2006, with largest declines in herbicides in North America and Europe and Indoxacarb insecticide in Asia Pacific, but were partially offset by higher sales in Latin America. The segment continued to expand its presence in fruit and vegetable specialty markets and continues to expand product offerings in the professional pest control market. Additionally, Agriculture & Nutrition operates within the specialty food ingredients market, including soy proteins and lecithins through its majority-owned venture with Bunge Limited, The Solae Company. Sales from these products increased in 2006, primarily due to slightly increased volume and increased prices of soy proteins and lecithins. In 2006, the segment launched a restructuring plan to increase investment in plant genetics, biotechnology and other growth opportunities while consolidating manufacturing assets, technology centers and marketing strategies in its nutrition and crop protection businesses. The segment recorded a charge of $194 million in the fourth quarter for employee separations and asset impairments associated with this investment and streamlining plan. The plan includes the closure of manufacturing units and the elimination of approximately 1,500 positions. Operating costs savings of approximately $100 million per year will be reinvested into the seed business to increase the speed to market of seed products with next-generation biotech traits (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $6.3 billion were 1 percent lower than last year reflecting slightly lower USD selling prices and volumes. Lower selling prices reflect declines in the crop protection market partially offset by prices for a richer mix in corn and soybean seed. Volume declines were driven by lower corn seed sales in North America, specialty products in India and herbicide sales in North America and Europe, partially offset by increases in the sale of soybeans. 2006 includes some earlier than anticipated seed sales for the 2007 planting season in Europe. The segment continues to invest resources in R&D and introduced approximately 210 new products and product applications during 2006. 2006 PTOI was $507 million versus $862 million, down 41 percent. The decline in 2006 PTOI reflects the charge of $194 million described above. In addition, 2006 PTOI reflects the sales decline and higher production costs across most of the segment, slightly offset by income of $73 million related to technology transfers, licensing agreements and asset sales. 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $6.4 billion increased 2 percent reflecting 4 percent higher USD selling prices and 2 percent lower volumes. Higher selling prices reflect a richer mix in corn and soybean seed. Volume declines were driven by lower corn seed sales in North America and specialty food ingredients partially offset by increases in the sale of soybeans, insecticides in Latin America and herbicides for cereals in Europe. During the year approximately 160 new products and product applications were introduced. 1 Registered Trademark of Dow AgroSciences LLC 31 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 2005 PTOI was $862 million versus $769 million in 2004, up 12 percent. The improvement in 2005 PTOI reflects higher USD selling prices partially offset by lower volumes and higher raw material costs. 2004 results also included restructuring charges of $34 million. In addition, during 2005 the segment continued to increase research spending and drive productivity improvements while managing overall fixed costs to a level consistent with 2004. Outlook In 2007, the segment anticipates modest earnings growth through increased Pioneer corn value offerings, including stacked traits and seed treatments in the U.S. and Canada and corn volumes in key international markets. Pioneer also expects continued market share gains in key soybean markets including the U.S., Canada and Brazil. The segment’s introduction of new crop protection products is projected to drive volume gains. Segment margins will be challenged by higher production and raw material costs and continued investments in research, which will drive long-term profitability. Technology will continue to play an important role for Agriculture & Nutrition. Pioneer will build on their global product offerings with the addition of 21 new soybean varieties and 90 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids. COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2006 $ 6.3 $ 795 2005 6.1 528 2004 5.9 698 Coatings & Color Technologies is one of the world’s leading automotive coatings suppliers and the world’s largest manufacturer of titanium dioxide white pigments. Products offered include high performance liquid and powder coatings for automotive OEMs, the automotive aftermarket (known as refinish) and general industrial applications, such as coatings for heavy equipment, pipes and appliances and electrical insulation. The company markets its refinish products using the DuPonttm, Standox®, Spies Hecker® and Nason® brand names. Standox® and Spies Hecker® are focused on the high-end refinish markets, while Nason® is primarily focused on economy coating applications. The segment’s broad line of DuPonttm Ti-Pure® titanium dioxide products, in both slurry and powder form, serve the coatings, plastic and paper industries. The segment’s titanium tetrachloride business has moved from a startup business to an established, growing venture, shipping product globally. In October, the business publicly announced a $30 million investment in additional titanium tetrachloride facilities at its titanium dioxide plant in Tennessee. When completed in mid-summer 2008, these facilities will supply up to 100 million pounds of high purity titanium tetrachloride annually to Allegheny Titanium’s new titanium metal plant in Utah. The business also launched and began commercial production in 2006 of its own titanium metal powder growth initiative. The key markets in which Coatings & Color Technologies operates continued to grow in 2006, with more significant growth in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. A key driver of the segment’s sales growth in 2006 was the completion of clean-up and repair of damage from Hurricane Katrina at its DeLisle, Mississippi titanium dioxide plant. The facility began a phased in restart in January 2006, returning to full operation by the end of the second quarter. During 2006, the segment was able to return the DeLisle plant back to full operations and regain market share lost during the hurricane related outage in 2005. Global demand for titanium dioxide white pigment was strong in 2006 with global market volumes up about 5 percent from 2005. 32 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Sales for refinish products grew in all regions, most notably in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. While the OEM market realized growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, it was more than offset by declines in the U.S., Canada and Europe. This reflects the flat or lower 2006 North American and European builds of automobiles and light trucks. Powder coatings sales grew in all regions, more significantly in Asia Pacific, U.S. and Europe, while demand in Latin America showed improvement. Worldwide sales in electrical insulation and metal coatings markets continued to improve. 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $6.3 billion were up 4 percent, reflecting about 2 percent higher USD selling prices for the segment. An additional 2 percent increase from volume was primarily realized in the pigments business, reflecting strong global demand as well as the first quarter startup of the DeLisle plant following Hurricane Katrina. Higher selling prices reflect concerted efforts within the segment to increase prices for the majority of its products as part of its efforts to offset the impact of higher raw material costs and the impact of lower global OEM automotive volumes. During the year approximately 390 new products and product applications were introduced. PTOI in 2006 of $795 million increased from $528 million in the prior year. Lower fixed costs in both years and higher volumes in pigments contributed to the improved 2006 earnings. PTOI in 2006 includes a net charge of $132 million for restructuring and $30 million primarily for accelerated depreciation related to the transformation plan that was initiated in first quarter 2006 (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 2006 PTOI also includes $142 million in insurance proceeds, primarily related to the hurricane damages suffered in 2005. 2005 PTOI included charges of $116 million related to the clean-up and restoration of manufacturing operations, as well as the write-off of inventory and plant assets that were destroyed by hurricanes. 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $6.1 billion were up 3 percent, reflecting 6 percent higher USD selling prices, partly offset by 3 percent lower volumes. Higher selling prices reflect concerted efforts within the segment to increase prices for the majority of its products as part of its efforts to offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Sales volumes were lower due to the DeLisle plant outage and the impact of lower global OEM automotive volumes. During the year approximately 360 new products and product applications were introduced. PTOI in 2005 of $528 million decreased from $698 million in the prior year. Higher raw material costs and lower sales volumes negatively affected 2005 earnings. PTOI in 2005 includes a $116 million hurricane charge while 2004 included charges of $96 million for employee separation costs and an automotive refinish litigation settlement. Outlook The segment expects sales in 2007 to increase slightly, while taking actions to reduce costs and improve profitability. Industry demand for titanium dioxide is expected to moderate in 2007, in line with more moderate global economic growth of about 2 percent. Competitive conditions in the global coatings industry will continue to provide a challenging operating environment in 2007. Modest growth is expected for refinish markets in mature economies while strong growth is expected to continue in emerging markets. Profitability of coatings sold to automotive OEM producers is highly dependent upon volume at specific plants the company services. North American and European 2007 automotive builds are expected to be essentially flat with 2006 levels, with moderate growth in Asia Pacific. 33 Table of Contents Part II Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued inks for ink-jet printing while continuing to pursue exciting new opportunities within Artistritm digital textile printing offerings. 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $3.8 billion increased about 4 percent over 2005, reflecting 2 percent higher USD prices coupled with a 2 percent improvement in volume. Price improvements reflect higher metals prices primarily for Micro Circuit Materials. Higher volumes reflect increased demand for fluoroproducts and electronic materials. Sales growth was strongest outside the U.S. During the year, approximately 190 new products & product applications were introduced. PTOI in 2006 was $589 million versus $571 million in 2005. Earnings growth in 2006 resulted from improved volume, modest pricing improvement and continued productivity gains. 2005 included a gain of $48 million on the sale of the company’s remaining interest in DuPont Photomasks, Inc. 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $3.7 billion increased about 7 percent, on 6 percent higher USD prices and a 1 percent improvement in volume. Price improvements reflect higher prices, primarily for fluorochemicals. Higher volumes reflect increased demand primarily for fluoroproducts and electronic materials partly offset by the divestiture of the remaining interest in DuPont Photomasks, Inc. Sales growth was strongest outside the U.S. During the year, approximately 220 new products and product applications were introduced. PTOI in 2005 was $571 million, which included a gain of $48 million on the sale of the company’s remaining interest in DuPont Photomasks, Inc. versus $212 million in the prior year. 2004 included net charges of $108 million for PFOA matters (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and $67 million for employee separation costs and asset impairment charges. Earnings growth in 2005 also resulted from improved pricing, modest demand improvement and continued productivity gains. Outlook For 2007, the segment expects moderate sales growth with gains in fluoropolymers, packaging graphics and the impact of higher precious metals prices in electronic materials. PTOI will reflect moderate growth for 2007 versus 2006 as sales growth is offset by higher investments in growth markets and technologies. This segment manufactures products that could be affected by uncertainties associated with PFOA matters. See the discussion on pages 51-53 under the subheading PFOA.

Dow acquired from DDE certain assets related to the Engage®, Nordel® and Tyrin® businesses. Upon the completion of this transaction, the remaining elastomers business became a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont and was renamed DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC. In response to a long-term declining demand for the polychloroprene products and the anticipated capital investment requirements at the Louisville, Kentucky facility, the company now plans to consolidate production at its upgraded LaPlace, Louisiana, facility by the end of 2007 at which time neoprene production will cease at the Louisville site. In 2005, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $34 million, reflecting severance and related costs for approximately 275 employees. Annual cost reductions related to ceasing neoprene production at Louisville and consolidating production at LaPlace are expected to offset reduced revenue related to declining demand. Cash payouts of $25 million are largely expected to be paid in 2008. 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $6.9 billion were 2 percent higher than 2005 reflecting 3 percent higher USD selling prices, partly offset by 1 percent lower volume. Sales volume reflects the year over year impact of the businesses transferred to Dow at June 30, 2005. Excluding from 2005 the sales related to assets transferred to Dow ($386 million), sales volumes were up reflecting stronger business environment in Asia and Europe and the recovery from the segment’s business interruption due to the 2005 hurricanes. During 2006, the segment introduced approximately 160 new products and product applications. PTOI in 2006 was $627 million compared to $523 million in 2005. PTOI in 2006 includes a $27 million impairment charge and reflects increased selling prices and aggressive cost controls that reduced fixed costs. 2005 PTOI of $523 million included a $17 million hurricane charge, $47 million in operating income related to certain DDE assets sold, a $25 million gain on sale of these DDE assets and a charge of $34 million related to the planned consolidation of the company’s neoprene operations at its LaPlace, Louisiana facility. 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $6.8 billion were 2 percent higher than 2004, reflecting 8 percent higher USD selling prices, partly offset by 6 percent lower sales volumes. Sales volumes declined due to the business interruption caused by the hurricanes, the aforementioned change in the elastomers business and exiting the DMT business, pricing actions to improve mix and margins and lower demand from markets tied to motor vehicle production in the U.S. and Europe. Excluding sales from the businesses transferred to Dow of $386 million and $536 million from the years 2005 and 2004, respectively, segment sales were up 4 percent, reflecting 8 percent higher USD selling prices and 4 percent lower volume. During 2005, approximately 180 new products and product applications were introduced. PTOI was $523 million compared to $295 million in 2004. 2005 PTOI includes $47 million in operating income related to certain elastomers assets sold and a $25 million gain on the sale of these assets. 2005 PTOI also reflects a charge of $17 million related to hurricane damage and a $34 million charge related to the aforementioned plans for the Louisville and LaPlace sites. In 2005, higher selling prices partly offset substantial increases in raw materials costs and the impact of the Hurricanes on supply and production. 2004 PTOI includes $268 million in elastomers antitrust litigation charges (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and $67 million in employee separation activities and asset impairment charges. Outlook North American and European 2007 automotive builds are expected to be essentially flat as compared to 2006 levels, with moderate growth in Asia Pacific. However, the half year pattern is expected to be the reverse of 2006 with higher production in the second half of 2007. Global packaging market growth is 36 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued expected to remain at current levels. The residential construction market in North America is expected to be softer than 2006 and it is anticipated that the electrical and electronics markets will continue to improve. Performance Materials expects to realize continued revenue growth in 2007. PTOI is expected to increase, benefiting from higher revenue, price increases, improved fixed cost performance and customer-driven innovations for products and processes. The level of earnings improvements in 2007 will depend on offsetting the continued high intermediate feedstock costs with price increases and further productivity gains. PHARMACEUTICALS Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2006 $ — $ 819 2005 — 751 2004 — 681 On October 1, 2001, DuPont Pharmaceuticals was sold to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. DuPont retained its interest in Cozaar® (losartan potassium) and Hyzaar® (losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide). These drugs were discovered by DuPont and developed in collaboration with Merck and are used in the treatment of hypertension. The U.S. patents covering the compounds, pharmaceutical formulation and use for the treatment of hypertension, including approval for pediatric use, will expire in 2010. DuPont has exclusively licensed worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights for Cozaar® and Hyzaar® to Merck. Pharmaceuticals receives royalties and net proceeds as outlined in these licenses and related agreements. Merck is responsible for manufacturing, marketing and selling Cozaar® and Hyzaar®. In September 2002, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cozaar® to reduce the rate of progression of nephropathy (kidney disease) in Type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension and nephropathy (hereafter referred to as the RENAAL study). Through 2005, approvals based on the RENAAL study have been granted in 60 countries, with further approvals pending. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study (LIFE) results were reported and published in March 2002 at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology. The study found that use of Cozaar® significantly reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) compared to the beta-blocker atenolol. In March 2003, the FDA approved Cozaar® as the first and only hypertensive medicine to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and LVH. In total, 64 countries have granted regulatory licenses to Cozaar® based on the LIFE study. In 2005, the FDA approved Hyzaar® to reduce the risk of stroke based on the LIFE study. The FDA granted a new indication for Hyzaar® in 2004 for use in patients with severe hypertension. This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients. In November 2006, Canada granted a new indication for Hyzaar® use in severe hypertension. The indication is identical to that in the U.S. In October 2005, Hyzaar® 100-12.5 mg tablets were introduced offering a new treatment alternative for doctors with patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by Cozaar® 100 mg alone. A total of 13 countries have granted approval and more are pending. Preminent®, trademark for losartan 50mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg in Japan, received marketing authorization in October of 2006. Preminent® is the first AIIA combination product to be commercialized in Japan. 37 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Outlook DuPont and Merck continue to support Cozaar® and Hyzaar® with clinical studies designed to identify additional therapeutic benefits for patients with hypertension and co-morbid conditions. The company expects the ongoing Cozaar®/Hyzaar® collaboration to continue to be an important contributor to earnings until the U.S. patents expire in 2010. Thereafter, earnings are expected to decline significantly. SAFETY & PROTECTION Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2006 $ 5.6 $ 1,080 2005 5.2 982 2004 4.7 837 Safety & Protection satisfies the growing global needs of businesses, governments and consumers for solutions that make life safer, healthier and more secure. By uniting market-driven science with the strength of highly regarded brands such as Kevlar®, Tyvek® and Nomex®, Safety & Protection has built a unique presence in the marketplace since its inception in 2002. The segment serves a large number of customers in markets that range from construction, transportation, communications, industrial chemicals, oil and gas, automotive, power and manufacturing to defense, homeland security and safety consulting. In addition to serving its existing customer base, the segment is investing in the future by going where the growth is. Its growth initiatives respond to critical needs, making people safer at home and at work; assisting the government, military and law enforcement; and preserving and protecting the environment. These initiatives include building innovations, personal protection, cleaning and disinfection solutions, government solutions, environmental solutions and safety consulting services. In 2006, disease preparedness and emergency response continued to be high priorities. The introduction of the DuPonttm Personal Biosecurity Kit, DuPonttm Workplace Biosecurity Kit and DuPonttm Biosecurity Kit for the Farm reflects an integrated systems approach to help prevent the spread of disease in humans and animals in the event of an avian flu pandemic. This multi-level methodology incorporates special protective apparel, clean and disinfect chemicals and safety management solutions. Products, including Kevlar® and Nomex®, provide weight savings, strength and durability as well as help meet stringent safety standards. Kevlar®, Nomex® and Tyvek® continue to hold strong positions in the personal and life protection markets due to the strong demand for military and law enforcement body armor and for personal protective gear in the oil and gas industry and in emerging regions. These include solutions for emergency response, military, law enforcement and firefighting apparel, given the ongoing concerns about homeland security. Global demand for products that prevent disease and improve productivity in the food, health care and industrial markets continue to create growth opportunities for the segment’s clean and disinfect offerings. Refinery Solutions business has made steady progress toward its goal of becoming the leading global provider of fully integrated environmental solutions, including air and water, for refineries and associated industries. Through Building Innovations, Safety & Protection continued to strengthen and enhance the building envelope and building interiors. New product launches are a key business driver; in 2006, Building Innovations launched DuPonttm Tyvek® weatherization systems. This product improves comfort, emergency efficiency, air quality and protection from the elements. The business is also positioning itself to take advantage of substantial growth opportunities in China, India and Eastern Europe and focusing more on commercial construction and remodeling markets to make up for the slowdown in U.S. residential construction. 38 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued DuPont Safety Resources continued to help organizations worldwide reduce workplace injuries and fatalities while gaining sustainable improvement in operating costs, productivity and quality. DuPont is a leader in this consulting field, selling materials and consulting. It operates within a range of business models, including sharing of client gains due to lower injury/workman’s compensation claims. Initiated by DuPont in 2005, the World Safety Declaration, the first-ever agreement by industry to improve workplace safety globally, continues to attract attention around the world. In 2006, 11 Chinese companies and organizations made a public, global commitment to safety by signing the declaration, bringing the total number of charter signers to 45. 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $5.6 billion were up 7 percent due to 5 percent higher USD prices and 2 percent higher volumes. All businesses in the platform grew sales year over year with the strongest growth in chemical solutions and aramids. Segment sales experienced slower U.S. growth as a result of shifts in demand for construction, but were offset by higher sales growth in other regions, especially emerging regions. During 2006, approximately 170 new products and product applications were introduced. PTOI in 2006 was $1,080 million, up 10 percent from $982 million in the prior year. The increase in PTOI reflects pricing gains and tight fixed cost control. 2006 PTOI includes a $47 million asset impairment charge related to an industrial chemical asset held for sale, partially offset by a $33 million benefit from insurance proceeds. 2005 PTOI includes a charge of $27 million related to hurricane costs and a $31 million gain from the sale of a non-core asset. 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $5.2 billion were up 11 percent, due to 6 percent higher USD selling prices and 5 percent higher volumes. The segment’s aramids fibers and safety consulting offerings primarily drove revenue growth. Segment sales were negatively affected during the last four months of the year by the Hurricanes, particularly in the aniline and acrylonitrile product lines. The Latin America and Asia Pacific regions experienced higher-than-average sales growth in 2005. During the year, approximately 200 new products and product applications were introduced. PTOI in 2005 was $982 million, up 17 percent from $837 million in the prior year. 2005 includes a charge of $27 million related to hurricane costs and a $31 million gain from the sale of a non-core asset. This net benefit, along with strong earnings growth from aramid fibers and safety consulting helped increase the segment’s PTOI. Pricing momentum continued within the segment during 2005, but was offset by higher raw material and transportation costs. 2004 includes charges of $70 million for employee separation activities and the impairment of certain European manufacturing assets. Outlook Safety & Protection will continue to drive growth in its product lines globally with the strength of its brands. U.S. and global demand for aramids is expected to remain strong. Continued U.S. and local level homeland security funding is expected during 2007 and will support growth in personal protective systems. The personal protection, medical packaging and medical fabrics market segments are expected to grow during the year. Volume growth in U.S. residential markets will continue to be lower than 2006, but mitigated by continued healthy growth in commercial, remodel markets and non-U.S. residential. Overall, Safety & Protection expects continued revenue growth and moderate earnings growth in 2007 based on continued market penetration, the introduction of new products and technologies and continued investment in its growth initiatives. 39 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued TEXTILES & INTERIORS Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2006 N/A N/A 2005 N/A N/A 2004 $ 3.3 $ (515 ) On April 30, 2004, the company sold the majority of the net assets of Textiles & Interiors (INVISTA) to subsidiaries of Koch, Inc. (Koch) for $3,844 million, except for the transfer of certain equity affiliates, pending the approval of equity partners. Beginning in 2005, financial transactions related to the remaining assets of Textiles & Interiors are reported in Other. OTHER The company combines the results of its developmental and nonaligned businesses under Other. Developmental businesses include bio-based materials and other growth initiatives. DuPont bio-based materials is focused on the development of biotechnology solutions using biology, chemistry, materials science and engineering in an integrated fashion to serve our customers. Specific growth projects across the company globally are consolidated within bio-based materials to capitalize on the market opportunities and technology needs in this high-growth industry, including crop-based products and technologies, the biorefinery initiative with the U.S. Department of Energy and metabolic engineering capability to manufacture biofuels. DuPont partnered with Tate & Lyle PLC to produce 1,3-propanediol (Bio-PDOtm), the key building block for DuPonttm Sorona® polymer, using a proprietary fermentation and purification process based on corn sugar. This bio-based method uses 40 percent less energy and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent versus petroleum-based propanediol. The first commercial-scale plant to manufacture Bio-PDOtm began production in November 2006, marking the beginning of commercial availability of the company’s bio-based pipeline. Nonaligned businesses includes activities and costs associated with Benlate® fungicide and other discontinued businesses and, since January 2005, activities related to the remaining assets of Textiles & Interiors. In 2005, the company completed the transfer of three equity affiliates to Koch and sold its interest in another equity affiliate. In January 2006, the company completed the sale of its interest in an equity affiliate to its equity partner for proceeds of $14 million thereby completing the sale of all the net assets of Textiles & Interiors. Additional details regarding Textiles & Interiors are contained in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the aggregate, sales in Other for 2006, 2005 and 2004 represent less than 1 percent of total segment sales. PTOI in 2006 was a loss of $134 million compared to a loss of $78 million in 2005. The losses in 2006 are reflective of the concentration of activities in bio-based materials. PTOI in 2005 included a net gain of $62 million related to the disposition of equity affiliates, primarily associated with the Textiles & Interiors separation. PTOI in 2005 was a loss of $78 million compared to a loss of $242 million in 2004. The improvement in 2005 reflects the gain relating to the disposition of four equity affiliates. The 2004 loss includes $94 million for employee separation activities, a $29 million charge to write off abandoned technology and a $20 million benefit from insurance proceeds related to Benlate® litigation. 40 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Liquidity & Capital Resources The company’s liquidity needs can be met through a variety of independent sources, including: Cash provided by operating activities, Cash and cash equivalents, Marketable debt securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. The company’s relatively low long-term borrowing level, strong financial position and credit ratings provide excellent access to these markets. Management considers its strong liquidity, financial position and flexibility to be a competitive advantage. This advantage is based on strong business operating cash flows over an economic cycle and a commitment to cash discipline regarding working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Pursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first, to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable debt securities balances of $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2006, provide primary liquidity to support all short-term obligations. Secondary liquidity, sufficient to meet upcoming debt maturities, comes from excellent access to capital markets and strong cash flow generation. Management believes that the company’s ability to generate cash and access the capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments and other cash needs for the foreseeable future. In the unlikely event that the company would not be able to meet its short-term liquidity needs, the company has access to approximately $3.5 billion in “same day” credit lines with several major financial institutions. These credit lines are primarily multi-year facilities. In October 2005, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded the company’s long-term debt credit rating following the company’s announced $5 billion share buyback program. Management expected the revision and it had minimal impact on the company’s borrowing costs and ability to access capital markets. The credit rating agencies left the company’s short-term credit ratings at or near the highest rating levels. The company’s long-term (LT) and short-term (ST) rating history at year end over the last three years follows: 2006 2005 2004 LT/ST/Outlook LT/ST/Outlook LT/ST/Outlook S&P A/A-1/Stable A/A-1/Stable AA-/A-1+/Negative Moody’s A2/P-1/Negative A2/P-1/Negative Aa3/P-1/Stable Fitch A/F1/Stable A/F1/Stable AA-/F1+/Stable (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided by operating activities $ 3,736 $ 2,542 $ 3,231 The company’s Cash provided by operating activities was $3.7 billion in 2006, a $1.2 billion increase from the $2.5 billion generated in 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher net income in 2006 and a reduction in contributions made to pension plans, partially offset by the timing of tax payments. Working capital productivity measures of days sales outstanding and inventory days supply were essentially flat in 2006 versus 2005, while days payable outstanding slightly decreased. The company’s Cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion in 2005, a $689 million decrease from the $3.2 billion generated in 2004. The year-over-year decrease principally reflects higher contributions to pension plans, primarily a $1 billion contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan. Changes in accounts receivable and inventories were modest. Working capital productivity measures of days sales outstanding, inventory days supply and days payable outstanding in 2005 were essentially flat versus 2004. 41 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash (used for) provided by investing activities $ (1,345 ) $ (602 ) $ 1,936 In 2006, Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.3 billion compared to the $602 million used in 2005. The increase reflects higher purchases of property, plant and equipment and lower proceeds from the sale of assets. In addition, the settlement of forward exchange contracts issued to hedge the company’s net exposure, by currency, related to monetary assets and liabilities resulted in the receipt of $45 million in 2006 versus the receipt of $653 million in 2005. These settlements were largely offset by revaluation of the items being hedged, which are reflected in the appropriate categories in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Purchases of plant, property and equipment in 2006 totaled $1.5 billion. In 2005, cash was used for investing activities totaling $602 million compared to investing activities that provided cash of $1.9 billion in 2004. The primary difference was related to proceeds from the sale of assets, which were $312 million in 2005 compared to $3.9 billion in 2004, the latter related principally to the sale of INVISTA (see Notes 6 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, in 2005, the settlement of forward exchange contracts issued to hedge the company’s net exposure, by currency, related to monetary assets and liabilities resulted in the receipt of $653 million versus cash payments of $509 million in 2004. The cash inflow in 2005 was primarily related to the stronger USD while the payments in 2004 were primarily attributable to the weaker USD. These settlements were largely offset by revaluations of the items being hedged, which are reflected in the appropriate categories in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Purchases of plant, property and equipment in 2005 totaled $1.3 billion, including $70 million to replace plant assets destroyed by the hurricanes. The company expects 2007 purchases of plant, property and equipment to be modestly higher than 2006 levels. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash used for financing activities $ (2,323 ) $ (2,851 ) $ (5,550 ) Changes in cash flows related to financing activities are principally related to the company’s borrowings and share repurchase activity. Total debt at December 31, 2006 was $7.5 billion, a $650 million decrease from December 31, 2005. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of borrowings related to the 2005 AJCA cash repatriation program partially offset by the issuance of $1 billion in 10 and 30 year notes in December 2006. Total debt at December 31, 2005, was $8.2 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from December 31, 2004, primarily due to new foreign borrowings to support the AJCA cash repatriation program, the $1 billion contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan and other cash needs, partially offset by domestic debt pay downs from the cash repatriated under the AJCA program. Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.4 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.48 in 2006, $1.46 in 2005 and $1.40 in 2004. The common dividend declared in the first quarter 2007 was the company’s 410th consecutive dividend since the company’s first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904. The company’s Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share buyback plan in June 2001. During 2005, the company purchased and retired 9.9 million shares at a total cost of $505 million. During 2006, there were no purchases of stock under this program. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the company has purchased 42 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 20.5 million shares at a total cost of $962 million. Management has not established a timeline for the buyback of the remaining stock under this plan. In October 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan. On October 27, 2005, the company repurchased 75.7 million shares of its common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement and paid $3.0 billion for the repurchase. Upon the conclusion of the agreement in 2006, the company paid $180 million in cash to Goldman, Sachs & Co. to settle the agreement. In addition, the company made open market purchases of its shares for $100 million bringing purchases to date under the $5 billion share buyback plan to about $3.3 billion. The company anticipates completing the remaining $1.7 billion of the program, consistent with its financial discipline principles, by the end of 2007. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of shares activity and “Certain Derivative Instruments” under “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements” for more information. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Debt Securities Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable debt securities totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004, respectively. The $1.6 billion decrease in cash from 2004 to 2005 was due mainly to the $3 billion share buyback and debt pay down partially offset by new borrowings to fund the repatriation of $9.1 billion under AJCA and positive net cash flow in several regions. Debt Total debt at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $7.5 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively. The company defines net debt as total debt less Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable debt securities. Management believes that net debt is meaningful because it provides the investor with a more holistic view of the company’s liquidity and debt position since the company’s cash balance is available to meet operating and capital needs, as well as to provide liquidity around the world. Net debt also allows the investor to more easily compare cash flow between periods without adjusting for changes in cash and debt. At December 31, 2006, net debt was $5.6 billion compared to $6.3 billion and $2.9 billion at year-end 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $692 million decrease in net debt from 2005 to 2006 reflects the company’s positive cash flow during 2006. The $3.4 billion increase in net debt from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to the $3.5 billion share repurchase program in 2005. The following table reconciles total debt to net debt: (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Commercial paper — — $ 584 Long-term debt due in one year $ 1,163 $ 986 167 Other short-term debt 354 411 185 Total short-term debt 1,517 1,397 936 Long-term debt 6,013 6,783 5,548 Borrowings and capital leases held for sale — — 1 Total debt $ 7,530 $ 8,180 $ 6,485 Cash and cash equivalents 1,814 1,736 3,369 Marketable debt securities 79 115 167 Net debt $ 5,637 $ 6,329 $ 2,949 43 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued The following table summarizes changes in net debt throughout 2006, 2005 and 2004: (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net debt-beginning of year $ 6,329 $ 2,949 $ 7,106 Cash provided by continuing operations (3,736 ) (2,542 ) (3,231 ) Purchases of property, plant & equipment and investments in affiliates 1,563 1,406 1,298 Net payments for businesses acquired 60 206 119 Proceeds from sales of assets (148 ) (312 ) (68 ) Proceeds from sale of assets-Textiles & Interiors, net of cash sold — — (3,840 ) Debt assumed by Koch — — (255 ) Forward exchange contract settlements (45 ) (653 ) 509 Dividends paid to stockholders 1,378 1,439 1,404 Acquisition of treasury stock 280 3,530 457 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (10 ) 722 (404 ) Other (34 ) (416 ) (146 ) Increase (decrease) in net debt (692 ) 3,380 (4,157 ) Net debt-end of year $ 5,637 $ 6,329 $ 2,949 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee Contracts Indemnifications The company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures and related business activities prior to the completion of the transactions. The terms of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and product liabilities, are generally indefinite. In addition, the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, against liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the company, such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters. If the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally indeterminable. The carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 is $105 million and $103 million, respectively. Although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued, due to the nature of indemnified items, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist. In connection with the sale of INVISTA, the company indemnified Koch against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal and environmental matters and other representations and warranties. The estimated fair value of these obligations of $70 million is included in the indemnifications balance of $105 million at December 31, 2006. The fair value was based on management’s best estimate of the value expected to be required to issue the indemnifications in a stand-alone, arm’s length transaction with an unrelated party and, where appropriate, by the utilization of probability-weighted discounted net cash flow models. The company does not believe that these indemnities will have a material impact on the future liquidity of the company (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 44 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Obligations for Equity Affiliates and Others The company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates, customers, suppliers and other unaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2006, the company had directly guaranteed $551 million of such obligations, plus $262 million relating to guarantees of obligations for divested subsidiaries and affiliates. This represents the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees. The company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2006, the liabilities recorded for these obligations were not material. Existing guarantees for customers and suppliers arose as part of contractual agreements. Existing guarantees for equity affiliates arose for liquidity needs in normal operations. In certain cases, the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers. The company has guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities related to divested subsidiaries including Conoco and its subsidiaries and affiliates and Consolidation Coal Sales Company. The Restructuring, Transfer and Separation Agreement between DuPont and Conoco requires Conoco to use its best efforts to have Conoco, or any of its subsidiaries, substitute for DuPont. Conoco and Consolidation Coal Sales Company have indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2006, the company has no liabilities recorded for these obligations. Additional information with respect to the company’s guarantees is included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees should unforeseen circumstances arise. Certain Derivative Instruments During 2005, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman Sachs) under which the company purchased and retired 75.7 million shares of DuPont’s outstanding common stock from Goldman Sachs on October 27, 2005 at a price of $39.62 per share, with Goldman Sachs purchasing an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the following nine-month period. On July 27, 2006, Goldman Sachs completed its purchase of 75.7 million shares of DuPont’s common stock at a volume weighted average price (VWAP) of $41.99 per share. Upon the conclusion of the agreement, the company made a settlement payment to Goldman Sachs of $180 million, which the company elected to pay in cash. The final settlement price was based upon the difference between the VWAP per share for the nine-month period, which ended July 27, 2006, and the purchase price of $39.62 per share. The amount paid to settle the contract was recorded as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital during the third quarter 2006. Synthetic Leases At December 31, 2006, the company has one synthetic lease program relating to miscellaneous short-lived equipment valued at approximately $116 million. Lease payments for these assets totaled $58 million in 2006, $51 million in 2005 and $54 million in 2004, and were reported as operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. The leases under this program are considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Furthermore, the lease payments associated with this program vary based on one month LIBOR. The company may terminate the program at any time by purchasing the assets. Should the company decide neither to renew the leases nor to exercise its purchase option, it must pay the owner a residual value guarantee amount, which may be recovered from a sale of the property to a third party. Residual value guarantees totaled $101 million at December 31, 2006. 45 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Contractual Obligations Information related to the company’s significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In Total at December 31, 2012 (Dollars in millions) 2006 2007 2008-2009 2010-2011 and beyond Long-term and short-term debt1 $ 7,162 $ 1,163 $ 2,378 $ 893 $ 2,728 Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity 2,737 372 560 301 1,504 Capital leases1 16 2 6 2 6 Operating leases 806 294 264 141 107 Purchase obligations2 Information technology infrastructure & services 149 62 52 17 18 Raw material obligations 393 192 143 40 18 Research & development agreements 18 12 5 — 1 Utility obligations 424 78 93 67 186 INVISTA-related obligations3 660 145 252 175 88 Human resource services 453 20 112 112 209 Other4 39 34 3 1 1 Total purchase obligations 2,136 543 660 412 521 Other long-term liabilities1,5 Workers’ compensation 70 17 33 10 10 Asset retirement obligations 62 16 24 7 15 Environmental remediation 349 80 110 60 99 Legal settlements 90 28 44 18 — Other6 117 17 24 14 62 Total other long-term liabilities 688 158 235 109 186 Total contractual obligations $ 13,545 $ 2,532 $ 4,103 $ 1,858 $ 5,052 1 Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement. 3 Includes raw material supply obligations of $526 million and contract manufacturing obligations of $132 million. 4 Primarily represents obligations associated with distribution, health care/benefit administration and other professional and consulting contracts. 5 Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have been excluded from the table as they are discussed below within Long-Term Employee Benefits. 6 Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other postretirement benefits. The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations should unforeseen circumstances arise. 46 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Long-Term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company’s earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans and medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors. About 80 percent of the company’s worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company’s worldwide benefit obligation for retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits are attributable to the benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Pension coverage for employees of the company’s non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension and medical, dental and life insurance benefits. Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees’ pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans’ actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. By law, no contributions are currently required to be made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2007 and no contributions are currently anticipated. Contributions beyond 2007 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. In 2006, the company contributed $280 million to its pension plans. The company anticipates that it will make approximately $290 million in contributions in 2007 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. in August 2006. The Act introduces new funding requirements for single-employer defined benefit pension plans, provides guidelines for measuring pension plan assets and pension obligations for funding purposes, introduces benefit limitations for certain underfunded plans and raises tax deduction limits for contributions to retirement plans. The new funding requirements become effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. Although significant regulatory guidance will be required prior to its 2008 effective date, the company does not anticipate that the Act will have a material near-term impact on its required contributions. In August 2006, the company announced major changes to its principal U.S. pension plan and principal savings and investment plan. Covered employees on the rolls as of December 31, 2006 will participate in an enhanced savings plan effective January 1, 2008 and will also accrue additional benefits in the pension plan, but the annual rate of pension accrual will be one-third of the current rate. In addition, company-paid postretirement survivor benefits for these employees will not continue to grow after December 31, 2007. Covered employees hired in the U.S. after December 31, 2006 will participate in the enhanced savings plan, but not in the pension plan. Eligible employees who contribute to the enhanced savings plan will receive a 100 percent company match on the first 6 percent of their savings rate, effectively doubling the current company match percentage, which is 50 percent on the first 6 percent of the employees’ savings rate. In addition to the savings match, the enhanced savings plan will assure a 100 percent employee participation in the plan by means of a company contribution of 3 percent of each employee’s eligible compensation into their account. Further, the definition of eligible compensation has been expanded to be consistent with the definition of the eligible compensation in the pension plan. 47 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued As a result of the amendment to the principal U.S. pension plan, the company was required to remeasure its pension expense for the remainder of 2006, reflecting plan assets and benefit obligations as of the remeasurement date. Better than expected return on plan assets and a higher discount rate of 6 percent decreased pretax pension expense for 2006 by $72 million. For 2007, the plan amendment is expected to result in a reduction in pension expense of about $40 million. Additional information related to these changes in the plans noted above is included in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On December 31, 2006, the company adopted SFAS 158 and recorded a $1,555 million after-tax charge to stockholder’s equity primarily due to reclassifying unrecognized losses related to the pension plans. Additional information related to the company’s adoption of SFAS 158 is included in Note 2 to the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Medical, dental and life insurance plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $322 million, $395 million and $435 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $340 million in 2007. Changes in cash requirements during this period reflect higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles. The company’s income can be significantly affected by pension benefits as well as retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company’s income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pretax charges and credits related to long-term employee benefits. (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Pension charges $ 191 $ 432 $ 997 Other postretirement benefit charges (credits) 138 218 (241 ) Net charge $ 329 $ 650 $ 756 These expenses are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in pension expense in 2006 reflects favorable returns on pension assets, plan amendments and changes in discount rates. The decrease in 2006 other postretirement benefit charges principally reflects the favorable medical trends in 2005 and refinements in estimates to reflect the anticipated commencement of the Medicare prescription drug program. The decrease in 2005 pension expense as compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to the absence of $446 million net settlement and curtailment charges recorded in 2004 in connection with the sale of INVISTA. In addition, the lower expense in 2005 reflects favorable returns on pension assets, higher contributions to pension plans and changes in discount rates. The increase in 2005 other postretirement benefit expenses principally reflects the absence of $436 million curtailment gains recognized in 2004 in connection with the sale of INVISTA. The company’s key assumptions used in calculating its long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2007, the higher than expected returns on pension assets, the impact of the U.S. plan amendment and changes in demographic and discount rates in 2006 are expected to result in a reduction in pension and other postretirement benefit pretax expenses of about $200 million. Environmental Matters DuPont operates global manufacturing facilities, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, DuPont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, eliminate the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of waste water discharges, 48 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future. While these costs may increase in the future, they are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Pretax environmental expenses charged to current operations totaled $521 million in 2006 compared with $468 million in 2005 and $455 million in 2004. These expenses include the remediation accruals discussed below; operating, maintenance and depreciation costs for solid waste, air and water pollution control facilities and the costs of environmental research activities. While expenses related to the costs of environmental research activities are not a significant component of the company’s overall environmental expenses, the company expects these costs to become proportionally greater as the company increases its participation in businesses for which environmental assessments are required during product development. The largest of the environmental expenses in 2006 was $109 million for the operation of water pollution control facilities and $127 million for solid waste management. About 78 percent of total annual environmental expenses resulted from operations in the U.S. In 2006, DuPont spent approximately $135 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects will total $143 million in 2007. In the U.S., significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures. Total CAA capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from $40 million to $70 million. The goal of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is to prevent unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment associated with the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of chemical substances. Under TSCA, the EPA has established reporting, record-keeping, testing and control-related requirements for new and existing chemicals. In 1998, the EPA challenged the U.S. chemical industry to voluntarily conduct screening level health and environmental effects testing on nearly 3,000 high production volume (HPV) chemicals or to make equivalent information publicly available. An HPV chemical is a chemical listed on the 1990 Inventory Update Rule with annual U.S. cumulative production and imports of one million pounds or more. The company is sponsoring more than two dozen HPV chemicals under the EPA’s challenge program. An extended HPV program has been initiated by the American Chemistry Council in which DuPont has agreed to sponsor an additional eleven new HPV chemicals listed on the 2002 Inventory Update Rule. Since 2000, the entire chemical industry has spent an estimated $250 million on HPV testing. In anticipation of the HPV challenge program ending, the EPA adopted two new rules under TSCA that require manufacturers to submit certain unpublished health and safety data and production/exposure data for certain HPV chemicals to the EPA. In December 2006, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals. This regulatory framework known as REACH will enter into force on June 1, 2007. One of its main objectives is the protection of human health and the environment. REACH requires manufacturers and importers to gather information on the properties of their substances that meet certain volume or toxicological criteria and register the information in a central database to be maintained by a Chemical Agency in Finland. The Regulation also calls for the progressive substitution of the most dangerous chemicals when suitable alternatives have been identified. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of REACH on its operations and consolidated financial position. Global climate change is being addressed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Convention) adopted in 1992. The Kyoto Protocol (the Protocol), adopted in December 1997, is an effort 49 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued to establish short-term actions under the Convention. The Protocol entered into force in February 2005 in most countries in which DuPont operates. The U.S. has declined to ratify the Protocol. The European Union (EU) has already begun a program to reduce emissions that includes emissions trading system linked to the Protocol. The U.S. continues to pursue a less-restrictive climate policy framework, emphasizing voluntary action. The Protocol establishes significant emission reduction targets for six gases considered to have global warming potential and is driving mandatory reductions in developed nations outside the U.S. DuPont has a stake in a number of these gases-CO2, HFCs and PFCs-and has been voluntarily reducing its emissions of these gases since 1991. DuPont has achieved reductions that are well ahead of the target and timetable of the Protocol. However, the company faces the possibility of country-specific restrictions in several countries where major reductions have not yet been achieved. High energy prices in Europe and the U.S. in recent years are also due, at least in part, to expectations of future emission reduction mandates in the U.S. and the impact of European climate change policies. DuPont is participating in emissions trading in the EU through the regulatory driven Emissions Trading Scheme and in the U.S. through the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange program. Emission reduction mandates within the U.S. are not expected in the near future, although Congressional proposals for such mandates have been introduced and a number of states are pursuing state-level programs. DuPont has discovered that very low levels of dioxins (parts per trillion to low parts per billion) and related compounds are inadvertently generated during its titanium dioxide pigment production process. The company has launched an extensive research and process engineering development program to identify the cause of the dioxin generation and to identify process modifications that will eliminate dioxin formation. The programs implemented to date have resulted in reductions of almost 50 percent. In the first half of 2007, DuPont will implement capital projects to achieve the aggressive goals to reduce such dioxin generation by 90 percent by year end 2007. Over 99 percent of the dioxin generated at DuPont’s production plants becomes associated with process solid wastes that are disposed in controlled landfills where public exposure is negligible. Remediation Expenditures The RCRA extensively regulates and requires permits for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination at the facility. If conditions warrant, companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, the costs of the RCRA corrective action program are typically borne solely by the company. The company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required over the next two decades. Annual expenditures for the near term, however, are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. The company’s expenditures associated with RCRA and similar remediation activities were approximately $44 million in 2006, $49 million in 2005, and $43 million in 2004. From time to time, the company receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a PRP under CERCLA or similar state statutes. CERCLA is often referred to as the Superfund and requires companies to undertake certain investigative and research activities at sites where it conducts or once conducted operations or where company generated waste has been disposed. The company has also, on occasion, been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company’s past operations. As of December 31, 2006, the company had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA or state laws at 390 sites around the U.S., with active remediation under way at 140 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at 185 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating 50 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued in “de minimis buyouts” with other PRPs whose waste, like the company’s, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at six new sites during 2006 compared with eight similar notices in 2005 and four in 2004. The company’s expenditures associated with CERCLA and similar state remediation activities were approximately $19 million in 2006, $27 million in 2005, and $27 million in 2004. For nearly all Superfund sites, the company’s potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other PRPs is relatively low. Other PRPs at sites, where the company is a party, typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and, where they do not, or where PRPs cannot be located, the company’s own share of liability has not materially increased. There are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites and at all CERCLA sites in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Total expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws were $64 million in 2006, $79 million in 2005, and $74 million in 2004. Remediation Accruals At December 31, 2006, the Consolidated Balance Sheets included an accrued liability of $349 million compared to $343 million at December 31, 2005. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2006. Of the $349 million accrued liability, approximately 10 percent was reserved for non-U.S. facilities. Approximately 65 percent of the reserve balance was attributable to RCRA and similar remediation liabilities, while about 25 percent was attributable to CERCLA liabilities. Remediation accruals of $71 million, $64 million and $58 million were added to the reserve in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. PFOA DuPont manufactures fluoropolymer resins and dispersions as well as fluorotelomers, marketing many of them under the Teflon® and Zonyl® brands. The fluoropolymer resin and dispersion businesses are part of the Electronic & Communication Technologies segment; the fluorotelomers business is part of the Safety & Protection segment. Fluoropolymer resins and dispersions are high-performance materials with many end uses including architectural fabrics, telecommunications and electronic wiring insulation, automotive fuel systems, computer chip processing equipment, weather-resistant/breathable apparel and nonstick cookware. Fluorotelomers are used to make soil, stain and grease repellants for paper, apparel, upholstery and carpets as well as firefighting foams and coatings. A form of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) is used as a processing agent to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. For over 50 years, DuPont purchased PFOA from a third party, but beginning in the fall of 2002, it began producing PFOA to support the manufacture of fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. PFOA is not used in the manufacturing of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC (DPE) uses PFOA in its manufacture of Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer parts and certain fluoroelastomers marketed under the Viton® trademark. DPE, a wholly owned subsidiary, is a part of the Performance Materials segment. 51 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. As a result, the EPA initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources of PFOA in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to PFOA occurs. In 2003, the EPA issued a preliminary risk assessment on PFOA that focuses on the exposure of the U.S. general population to PFOA and possible health effects, including developmental toxicity concerns. On January 12, 2005, the EPA issued a draft risk assessment on PFOA. The draft stated that cancer data for PFOA may be best described as “suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential” under the EPA’s Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. Under the Guidelines, the descriptor “suggestive” is typically applied to agents if animal testing finds any evidence that exposure causes tumors in one species of animal. The EPA requested that the Science Advisory Board (SAB) review and comment on the scientific soundness of this assessment. On May 31, 2006, the SAB released its report setting forth the view, based on laboratory studies in rats, that the human carcinogenic potential of PFOA is more consistent with the EPA’s descriptor of “likely to be carcinogenic” as defined in the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. However, in its report the SAB indicated that additional data should be considered before the EPA finalizes its risk assessment of PFOA. Under the Guidelines the “likely” descriptor is typically applied to agents that have tested positive in more than one species, sex, strain, site or exposure route with or without evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. The EPA has acknowledged that it will consider additional data and has indicated that another SAB review will be sought after the EPA makes its risk assessment. DuPont disputes the cancer classification recommended in the SAB report because it is based on animal studies and does not adequately reflect human health data which to date demonstrates no increase in cancer rates known to be associated with PFOA. In February 2006, a coalition of environmental and labor groups submitted a petition to accelerate the consideration of PFOA under California Proposition 65 which requires the State to publish a list of chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. The petition was denied during fourth quarter 2006. The EPA has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks associated with PFOA. The EPA has also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any products because of concerns about PFOA. In November 2006, DuPont entered into an Order on Consent under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishing a precautionary interim screening level for PFOA of 0.5 part per billion (ppb) in drinking water sources in the area around the Washington Works site located in Parkersburg, West Virginia. As part of the Order on Consent, DuPont will conduct a survey and perform sampling and analytical testing of certain public and private water systems in the area. DuPont is required under the agreement to install water treatment systems if PFOA levels at or above 0.5 ppb are detected. Currently, there are no regulatory actions pending that would prohibit the production or use of PFOA. However, there can be no assurance that the EPA or any other regulatory entity will not choose to regulate or prohibit the production or use of PFOA in the future. Products currently manufactured by the company representing approximately $1 billion of 2006 revenues could be affected by any such regulation or prohibition. DuPont respects the EPA’s position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of PFOA and DuPont and other companies have outlined plans to continue research, emission reduction and product stewardship activities to help address the EPA’s questions. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to the EPA’s 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. 52 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued DuPont submitted its baseline reporting data to the EPA on October 31, 2006. The company has refined its Program commitments based on a careful review of the data, the EPA Program guidelines and the state of the technology. Key elements of the DuPont commitment to EPA include reducing global emissions from manufacturing facilities by 97 percent by 2007 (which incorporates the substantial achievement of 94 percent reduction as of December 31, 2006 already realized through DuPont’s ongoing reduction program); reducing PFOA content in fluoropolymer dispersions faster and further than the goals set by the Program; and, by 2010, reducing PFOA content and any residual impurities in fluorotelomer products that could break down to PFOA. DuPont will work individually and with others in the industry to inform EPA’s regulatory counterparts in the European Union, Canada, China and Japan about these activities and PFOA in general, including emissions reductions from DuPont’s facilities, reformulation of the company’s fluoropolymer dispersions and new manufacturing processes for fluorotelomers products. DuPont has developed technology that can reduce the PFOA content in fluoropolymer dispersions by 97 percent and is in the process of launching low PFOA dispersion products. In addition, the company started up a new process at its Pascagoula, Mississippi manufacturing site that will reduce PFOA trace levels in fluorotelomer products even further and began to introduce products based on this new technology in late 2006. Recently, the company announced its commitment to eliminate the need to make, buy or use PFOA by 2015. This plan creates an opportunity for the company to leverage its research and development strengths to develop new sustainable technologies and products. Based on health and toxicological studies, DuPont believes the weight of evidence indicates that PFOA exposure does not pose a health risk to the general public. To date no human health effects are known to be caused by PFOA, even in workers who have significantly higher exposure levels than the general population although study of the chemical continues. DuPont conducted a two-phase employee health study on PFOA at its Washington Works site. Results from the first phase of this study for more than 1,000 workers indicate no association between exposure to PFOA and most of the health parameters that were measured. The only potentially relevant association is a modest increase in some, but not all, lipid fractions, e.g. cholesterol, in some of the highest exposed workers. The second phase was a mortality study that involves the examination of all causes of death in more than 6,000 employees who worked at the Washington Works site during its more than fifty years of operation. Based on the observation of a modest increase in some lipid fractions in the study’s first phase, the second phase included a more detailed analysis of heart disease. No overall increase in deaths related to heart disease was found. DuPont has established reserves in connection with certain PFOA environmental and litigation matters (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments Under procedures and controls established by the company’s Financial Risk Management Framework, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions, petrochemical and petroleum companies and exchanges. 53 Table of Contents Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, continued The company hedges foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, certain business-specific foreign currency exposures and certain energy feedstock purchases. In addition, the company enters into exchange traded agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge exposures relevant to agricultural feedstock purchases. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments, accounts receivable and derivatives. As part of the company’s risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits on a daily basis. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The company’s sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. As of December 31, 2006, no one individual customer balance represents more than 5 percent of the company’s total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company’s global businesses. The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. Foreign Currency Risk The company’s objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes. Accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, commitments and cash flows. The company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are minimized. The following table summarizes the impacts of this program on the company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, continued From time to time, the company will enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Forward exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements and to place foreign currency deposits and marketable securities investments. Interest Rate Risk The company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on three- or six-month USD LIBOR. Interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. Commodity Price Risk The company enters into over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. A portion of energy feedstock purchases are hedged to reduce price volatility using fixed price swaps and options. Hedged feedstock purchases include natural gas and ethane. The company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory. Under these contracts, growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the market price of grain for a period of time following harvest. Derivative instruments, such as commodity futures that have a high correlation to the underlying commodity, are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers. The company utilizes agricultural commodity futures to manage the price volatility of soybean meal. These derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk. Additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 55 Table of Contents Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, continued Sensitivity Analysis The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the market prices or rates that existed at December 31, 2006 and 2005. The sensitivity for interest rate swaps is based on a one percent change in the market interest rate. Foreign currency, agricultural and energy derivative sensitivities are based on a 10 percent change in market rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company’s strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures and financial results are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events. The company cannot guarantee that these assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. For some of the important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 7. Overview DuPont has been successfully executing its three growth strategies – Putting Science to Work, Leveraging the Power of One DuPont and Going Where the Growth Is. In 2007, approximately 1,200 new products were commercialized, approximately 2,000 new U.S. patent applications were filed and more than one third of 2007 sales were derived from products introduced in the last 5 years. The company again reduced fixed costs as a percent of Net sales. In 2007, over sixty percent of the company’s sales were to customers outside of the United States. The company achieved 18 percent growth in the emerging markets of Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. In January 2008, the company outlined goals and objectives beyond 2008 through 2010 in a five point plan. The company sees potential for double digit earnings growth driven by advances in several strategic areas: New science for growing agriculture markets – With demand for protein rising rapidly, global food production will have to double between now and 2025 on virtually the same amount of land currently in production. As one of the world’s largest producers of corn and soy seed and crop protection products, DuPont is bringing to market more efficient and cost-effective control systems for weeds, insects and fungus to boost farm productivity, quality and yield. The company anticipates that new products such as Optimumtm GATtm traits and Rynaxyprtm insecticide, will provide significant growth. Growing demand for Safety & Protection – People want to feel safer and more secure at home, on the job, in their cars – everywhere. The company’s long experience and $6 billion base business in advanced materials such as Kevlar®, Nomex® and Tyvek® have resulted in a broad offering of products and services that address this growing global need. In 2007, the company announced a new $500 million Kevlar® brand fiber production facility in South Carolina, which came on the heels of capacity expansions for Nomex® flame-resistant fibers. In 2008, the company will continue to use its science and growth investments to take advantage of the opportunity it sees for attractive growth in its Safety & Protection segment. Springboard position in emerging markets – The company’s rapid top line growth in emerging markets is a key factor in counter-balancing softness in the North American automotive and U.S. housing markets. Business unit leaders in the Performance Materials, Coatings & Color Technologies and Electronic & Communication Technologies segments are succeeding in generating strong growth in the emerging markets of Asia Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Extend cost productivity gains – DuPont continues to reduce fixed costs as a percent of Net sales. Cost savings projects have offset inflation in personnel costs and have provided funding for a large number of growth investments. DuPont is focused on continuing to generate cost productivity gains as a mechanism for funding growth. Continue development of Applied Biosciences – Science and innovation are critical to the company’s success. Ongoing development and commercialization of DuPont Applied Biosciencestm products will continue through at least 2010 with increasing intensity. 18 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Analysis of Operations (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 NET SALES $ 29,378 $ 27,421 $ 26,639 2007 versus 2006 Consolidated net sales for 2007 were $29.4 billion, up 7 percent. This growth was principally the result of an 11 percent increase in sales outside of the U.S., reflecting in part the benefit of a weaker U.S. dollar (USD), which added 3 percent to worldwide sales. Worldwide volumes and local selling prices each increased 2 percent. Sales in the U.S. increased 1 percent reflecting 3 percent higher selling prices, partially offset by 2 percent lower volume. The decrease in U.S. sales volume was primarily due to lower demand for the company’s products related to housing and automotive production markets. Sales in Canada and Latin America increased 15 percent, primarily due to a 10 percent volume increase reflecting a substantial increase in sales of seed and crop protection products in South America. The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2007 Consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year: Percent Change Due to: Percent 2007 Change vs. Local Currency (Dollars in billions) Net Sales 2006 Price Effect Volume Worldwide $ 29.4 7 2 3 2 United States 11.3 1 3 - (2 ) Europe 8.8 12 2 8 2 Asia Pacific 5.2 8 2 2 4 Canada & Latin America 4.1 15 2 3 10 2006 versus 2005 Consolidated net sales for 2006 were $27.4 billion, up 3 percent. The increase reflects 2 percent higher local selling prices and 2 percent higher net volume partially offset by a 1 percent reduction in worldwide sales attributable to the transfer of certain elastomers assets in 2005. Local selling prices increased across all regions and business segments. During 2006, significant volume increases in key growth regions, particularly Asia Pacific and Latin America, along with modest growth in Europe, more than offset lower U.S. volume. Volume declines in the U.S. are largely attributable to lower demand in housing and automotive production markets. These declines more than offset the recovery in the U.S. of titanium dioxide, industrial chemical and packaging polymer sales lost in 2005 as a result of business disruptions due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2006 Consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year: Percent Change Due to: Percent 2006 Change vs. Local Currency (Dollars in billions) Net Sales 2005 Price Effect Volume Other1 Worldwide $ 27.4 3 2 - 2 (1 ) United States 11.1 - 3 - (1 ) (2 ) Europe 7.9 3 2 (1 ) 3 (1 ) Asia Pacific 4.8 5 3 (2 ) 7 (3 ) Canada & Latin America 3.6 10 2 3 5 - 1 Percentage change due to the absence in 2006 of sales from elastomers businesses transferred to Dow on June 30, 2005.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 OTHER INCOME, NET $ 1,275 $ 1,561 $ 1,852 2007 versus 2006 Other income, net, decreased $286 million versus 2006. This reduction is primarily due to an impairment charge of $165 million to write down the company’s investment in a polyester films joint venture, a decrease of $81 million in net pretax exchange gains, and a decrease in miscellaneous items of $239 offset by higher Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income of $136 million (see page 34 for Pharmaceuticals segment information and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in miscellaneous items resulted from the absence of 2006 benefits of $90 million for the reversal of accrued interest related to the favorable settlement of certain prior-year tax contingencies and $76 million of insurance recoveries from its insurance carriers. Of the $76 million, $61 million related to costs, including outside counsel fees and expenses and settlements paid over the past twenty years as part of asbestos litigation matters. During this twenty year period, DuPont has been served with thousands of lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to asbestos on DuPont premises. Most of these claims have been disposed of through trial, dismissal or settlement. Management believes it is remote that the outcome of remaining or future asbestos litigation matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity. These asbestos related insurance recoveries were reflected in Cash provided by operating activities within the company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The remaining $15 million is part of a total recovery of $143 million relating to insurance recoveries associated with damages to the company’s facilities suffered as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The majority of the Hurricane Katrina recovery was included in Cost of goods sold and other operating charges in the Consolidated Income Statements. No amounts were received from insurance carriers for damages suffered by the company as a result of Hurricane Rita. 2006 versus 2005 Other income, net decreased $291 million versus 2005. This reduction is primarily due to a $407 million decrease in net pretax exchange gains (see page 46 for a discussion of the company’s program to manage currency risk and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2006, the company recorded $76 million of insurance recoveries in Other income, net from its insurance carriers. Additional information related to the company’s Other income, net is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES $ 21,565 $ 20,440 $ 19,683 As a percent of Net sales 73 % 75 % 74 % 2007 versus 2006 Cost of goods sold and other operating charges (COGS) for the year 2007 were $21.6 billion, versus $20.4 billion in 2006, an increase of 6 percent. COGS was 73 percent of net sales for 2007 versus 75 percent for the year 2006. The 2 percentage point reduction principally reflects the absence of 2006 charges for restructuring, the effects of the company’s productivity initiatives and a current year benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar due to currency exchange rate changes which increased sales at a higher rate than the rate they increased COGS. Partly offsetting these factors were increases in raw material and finished product distribution costs, as well as the absence of a 2006 benefit of $128 million in insurance recoveries. The 2006 restructuring programs included the elimination of approximately 3,200 positions and redeployment of about 400 employees in excess positions to the extent possible. The company recorded a net charge of $326 million in 2006 related to employee separation costs and asset impairment charges. This included $184 million to provide severance benefits for approximately 2,800 employees involved in manufacturing, marketing and sales, administrative and technical activities. Additional details related to these programs are contained in the individual segment reviews and in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Payments from operating cash flows to terminated employees as a result of the 2006 plans totaled $77 million during 2007 and $32 million during 2006. Annual pretax cost savings of about $125 million per year are associated with the Coatings & Color Technologies program, approximately $53 million of which is reflected in COGS. Cumulative savings of approximately 80 percent and 35 percent was realized in 2007 and 2006, respectively, with the remainder expected to be realized in 2008. 2006 versus 2005 COGS for the year 2006 was $20.4 billion, versus $19.7 billion in 2005, up 4 percent. COGS was 75 percent of sales in 2006 versus 74 percent in 2005. The 1 percentage point increase in COGS as a percent of sales principally reflects higher raw material costs not entirely covered by selling price increases and higher costs for restructuring plans discussed above. In 2006, the company recorded a benefit to COGS for $128 million for insurance recoveries related to the property damage suffered as a result of Hurricane Katrina. In 2005, the company recorded charges of $160 million related to the clean-up and restoration of manufacturing operations, as well as the write-off of inventory and plant assets that were destroyed by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Hurricane related charges reduced segment earnings as follows: Coatings & Color Technologies – $116 million; Performance Materials – $17 million; and Safety & Protection – $27 million. The company recorded a net charge of $326 million in 2006 related to employee separation costs and asset impairment charges as discussed above. In 2005, the company evaluated capital investment requirements at its Louisville, Kentucky facility and the declining demand for the neoprene products produced at the facility. As a result, the company has made plans to consolidate neoprene production at its upgraded facility in LaPlace, Louisiana. On December 31, 2007, the company initiated the shutdown, abatement and dismantlement process at the Louisville facility. A charge of $34 million was recorded in 2005 reflecting severance and related costs for approximately 275 employees, principally at the Louisville site. Additionally, a benefit of $13 million was recorded in 2005 to reflect changes in estimates related to employee separations that were implemented in earlier years. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $ 3,364 $ 3,224 $ 3,223 As a percent of Net sales 11 % 12 % 12 % Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $140 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase is primarily due to increased global commissions, and selling and marketing infrastructure investments in the Agriculture & Nutrition segment. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE $ 1,338 $ 1,302 $ 1,336 As a percent of Net sales 5 % 5 % 5 % Research and development expense (R&D) as a percent of sales remained constant over the three-year period. Higher R&D in 2007 for accelerated biotechnology trait research and development in the Agriculture & Nutrition segment was partially offset by a decrease in R&D in the Coatings & Color Technologies segment as a result of consolidating research facilities as a part of its 2006 business transformation plan. Expenditures in 2006 were consistent with spending by segment in 2005 and reflect concentration in expansion of seed traits, breeding advancement and product development within the Agriculture & Nutrition segment, as well as activities to support the other growth platforms. 21 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 INTEREST EXPENSE $ 430 $ 460 $ 518 Interest expense decreased $30 million in 2007 compared to 2006 and $58 million in 2006 versus 2005. These decreases were primarily due to lower average borrowing levels and higher capitalized interest, partially offset by slightly higher average interest rates. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 SEPARATION ACTIVITIES – TEXTILES & INTERIORS $ - $ - $ (62 ) On April 30, 2004, the company sold a majority of the net assets of the then Textiles & Interiors segment (INVISTA) to subsidiaries of Koch Industries, Inc. (Koch). During 2005, the company sold its investments in three affiliated companies to Koch and its investment in a fourth affiliated company to its equity partner, resulting in a net benefit of $62 million. Although the transfer of these affiliates completed the sale to Koch, the company has significant continuing involvement with INVISTA as a result of long-term purchase and supply contracts and a long-term contract manufacturing agreement under which INVISTA manufactures and supplies certain products for the company. In January 2006, the company sold its interest in a Textiles & Interiors equity affiliate to its equity partner for proceeds of $14 million thereby completing the sale of all of the net assets of Textiles & Interiors. For more information related to the Textiles & Interiors separation, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES $ 748 $ 196 $ 1,470 Effective income tax rate 20.0 % 5.9 % 41.3 % In 2007, the company recorded a tax provision of $748 million which included a benefit of $108 million related to tax settlements offset by net tax expense in other operating results (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) In 2006, the company recorded a tax provision of $196 million which included a benefit of $272 million related to tax settlements and a $186 million benefit for reversal of tax valuation allowances related to the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries due to the sustained improved business performance in these subsidiaries. These tax benefits were offset by net tax expense in other operating results (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2005, the company recorded a tax provision of $1,470 million which included $483 million of tax expense on exchange gains associated with the company’s policy of hedging the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations and $292 million of tax expense related to the repatriation of $9.1 billion under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations provided that repatriated cash from such accumulated earnings is reinvested in the U.S. pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan. The company’s current estimate of the 2008 effective income tax rate is about 26 percent, excluding tax effects of exchange gains and losses which can not be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 6 for additional detail on items that significantly impact the company’s effective tax rates. In the past three years, these items have generally included a lower effective tax rate on international operations and tax settlements. 22 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 NET INCOME $ 2,988 $ 3,148 $ 2,056 2007 versus 2006 Net income for 2007 decreased 5 percent versus 2006, primarily due to the higher effective tax rate, as well as the decrease in Other income. These decreases were partially offset by a 7 percent increase in Net sales, the absence of the restructuring charges taken in 2006 and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. 2006 versus 2005 Net income for 2006 increased 53 percent versus 2005, reflecting higher selling prices, higher sales volumes, lower fixed costs and an increase in Other income, net, partly offset by higher raw material costs. Selling prices increased year over year in each quarter of 2006 and were higher for each platform and for each region for the full year. Net income for 2006 also included benefits from tax settlements, reversals of tax valuation allowances and insurance recoveries. These benefits were partly offset by charges for restructuring and asset impairments. 2005 results included significant hurricane related charges as well as tax expenses associated with the repatriation of cash under AJCA. Corporate Outlook The company’s current 2008 earnings outlook is a range of $3.35 to $3.55 per share based on the expectation of continued revenue growth in emerging markets and earnings growth across all of the growth platforms. New product acceleration, mix enrichment, pricing discipline and continued cost and capital productivity gains across the company are expected to be additional contributing factors. The company’s 2008 outlook is positive; however, it is moderated by continued weakness in U.S. housing and North American automotive markets and continued escalation of energy, ingredient and transportation costs. Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” (SFAS 157) which addresses how companies should measure fair value when required for recognition or disclosure purposes under GAAP. The standard’s provisions will be applied to existing accounting measurements and related disclosures that are based on fair value. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard applies a common definition of fair value to be used throughout GAAP, with emphasis on fair value as a “market based” measurement versus an entity-specific measurement, and establishes a hierarchy of fair value measurement methods. The disclosure requirements are expanded to include the extent to which companies use fair value measurements, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The new standard’s provisions applicable to the company will be applied prospectively beginning January 1, 2008. The FASB, on February 12, 2008, issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 157-2. This FSP permits a delay in the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The delay is intended to allow the Board and constituents additional time to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen, or that may arise, from the application of SFAS 157. On February 14, 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-1 to exclude SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases, and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements from the scope of SFAS 157. Management expects that adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material effect on the company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007) “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141R) which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. SFAS 141R addresses the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in business combinations. SFAS 141R also requires disclosure that enables users of the financial statements to better evaluate the nature and financial effect of business combinations. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R will be adopted by the company on January 1, 2009. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 23 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (SFAS 160) which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also clarifies that a third-party, non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 also requires disclosure that clearly identifies and distinguishes between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 will be adopted by the company on January 1, 2009. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company’s accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Long-term Employee Benefits Accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company’s pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan obligations or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining working life of current employees. About 80 percent of the company’s benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company’s other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. The company utilizes published long-term high quality bond indices to determine the discount rate at the balance sheet date. Where commonly available, the company considers indices of various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy and projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than their fair value. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair market value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company’s calculation of net 24 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair market value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan: (Dollars in billions) 2007 2006 Market-related value of assets $ 19.3 $ 17.5 Fair market value of plan assets $ 19.1 $ 18.3 For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets. The fair value of assets in all pension plans was $22.6 billion at December 31, 2007, and the related projected benefit obligations were $22.2 billion. In addition, obligations under the company’s unfunded other long-term employee benefit plans were $3.8 billion at December 31, 2007. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company’s pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company’s pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2007: 1/2 Percentage Point 1/2 Percentage Point (Dollars in millions) Increase Decrease Discount Rate $ 10 $ (3) Expected rate of return on plan pension assets 110 (110) Additional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under “Long-Term Employee Benefits” beginning on page 40. Environmental Matters DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company’s estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. The company has recorded a liability of $357 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2007; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued. Much of this liability results from the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, often referred to as the Superfund), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and similar state laws. These laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. Federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations and could, among other things, impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company-generated waste disposal. Over the next two decades, the company could incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of PRPs. Therefore, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. 25 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Legal Contingencies The company’s results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement claims and antitrust claims. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company’s experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter’s current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The breadth of the company’s operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the ultimate taxes the company will pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company’s tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes from future completed tax examinations could be significant when compared to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits, however due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of these audits and the possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increase or decrease that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material. At December 31, 2007, the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of $4,750 million, net of valuation allowance of $1,424 million. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. Valuation of Assets Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other purchased intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of long-lived assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as 26 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. Future changes in the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges. Information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on long-lived assets is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Reviews Segment sales include transfers. Segment pretax operating income (PTOI) is defined as operating income before income taxes, minority interests, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and net interest. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated Net sales and segment PTOI to Income before income taxes and minority interests for 2007, 2006 and 2005 is included in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2007, the company changed the alignment of certain businesses within Agriculture & Nutrition, Performance Materials and Other. These changes were made to better align the businesses with the particular growth platform that management believes will provide more opportunity for synergy and technology development in future periods. The 2006 and 2005 segment information below has been reclassified to reflect the 2007 organizational structure. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2007 $ 6.8 $ 894 2006 $ 6.0 $ 604 2005 $ 6.1 $ 875 Agriculture & Nutrition leverages the company’s technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply. Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited. Therefore, increases in production will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted acreage. Agriculture & Nutrition delivers a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. The segment operates across the food value chain from inputs for producing agriculture products to global production and distribution of soy-based food ingredients to food quality diagnostic testing equipment. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and enhance the value of grains and soy through improved seed traits, superior germplasm and the effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Agriculture & Nutrition includes the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. (Pioneer), which is also the world’s leading seed brand and a world leader in improving crop yields with hybrid and varietal seeds that improve grower yields and provide insect protection and herbicide tolerance. The principal products of Pioneer are hybrid seed corn and soybean seed. Sales of Pioneer® brand seeds increased 19 percent in 2007 with gains in corn seed sales globally, partially offset by lower North American soybean seed sales on a decline in North American planted acreage. In 2007, farmers in North America continued to demonstrate a preference for corn hybrids containing biotechnology traits and Pioneer had a limited supply of these products. As a result, corn market share in North America is at 30 percent. Pioneer will have increased supply of leading products containing biotechnology traits in 2008 and expects to maintain its present market share. In international operations, Pioneer increased market share in key segments supported by strong product performance. Pioneer benefited from the global launch of approximately 25 new soybean varieties and 130 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids that include new combinations of corn borer, corn rootworm and weed management traits highlighted by the expansion of the Herculex®1 family of traits. 1 Registered Trademark of Dow AgroSciences LLC 27 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued During the third quarter 2007, Pioneer entered into a business agreement on corn herbicide tolerance and insect control trait technologies with Monsanto Company. Among other provisions, modifications were made to the existing corn license agreements; both parties agreed to exchange certain non-assert and other intellectual property rights; and both parties obtained rights to reference and access certain regulatory data and approval in which the other party has certain interests. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description of this agreement. Agriculture & Nutrition also serves the global production agriculture industry with crop protection products in the grain and specialty crop sectors, forestry and vegetation management. Principal crop protection products are herbicides, fungicides, insect control products and plant growth regulators. The segment continued to expand its presence in fruit and vegetable specialty markets and continues to expand product offerings in the professional pest control market. Additionally, the segment operates within the specialty food ingredients market, including soy proteins and lecithins through its majority-owned venture with Bunge Limited, The Solae Company. In 2006, the segment launched a restructuring plan to increase investment in plant genetics, biotechnology and other growth opportunities while consolidating manufacturing assets, technology centers and marketing strategies in its nutrition and crop protection businesses. The segment recorded a charge of $122 million in the fourth quarter 2006 for employee separations and asset impairments associated with this investment and streamlining plan. The plan includes the closure of manufacturing units and the elimination of approximately 1,500 positions. Operating costs savings of approximately $100 million per year will be reinvested into the seed business (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). During 2007, operating costs savings of $40 million were realized, which partially offset the growth investment in the seed business. 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $6.8 billion were 14 percent higher reflecting 9 percent higher USD selling prices and a 5 percent increase in volume. Higher USD selling prices reflected a richer mix of corn and soybean seed, and crop protection herbicides and fungicides. Volume increases were driven by corn seed sales in North America, herbicides in Europe and fungicides in Latin America, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of soybean seed on lower planting acreage in North America. 2007 PTOI was $894 million versus $604 million in 2006. 2006 PTOI included a $122 million restructuring charge. In addition, 2007 PTOI benefited from sales volume and price gains, partially offset by higher production costs across most of the segment and the growth investment in the seed business. 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $6.0 billion were 1 percent lower reflecting slightly lower USD selling prices and volumes. Lower selling prices reflected declines in the crop protection market partially offset by prices for a richer mix in corn and soybean seed. Volume declines were driven by lower corn seed sales in North America, specialty products in India and herbicide sales in North America and Europe, partially offset by increases in the sale of soybean seed. 2006 included some earlier than anticipated seed sales for the 2007 planting season in Europe. 2006 PTOI was $604 million versus $875 million in 2005. The decline in 2006 PTOI reflected the charge of $122 million described above. In addition, 2006 PTOI reflected the sales decline and higher production costs across most of the segment, slightly offset by income related to technology transfers, licensing agreements and asset sales. Outlook In 2008, the segment anticipates continued PTOI growth through increased Pioneer corn value offerings, including stacked traits and seed treatments in the U.S. and Canada. Pioneer will build on their North American product offerings with the addition of approximately 30 new soybean varieties and 60 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids. In international operations, Pioneer expects continued market share gains supported by strong product performance. Pioneer also expects continued market share gains in key soybean markets including the U.S., Canada and Brazil. The segment’s introduction of new crop protection products is projected to drive volume gains, particularly in Europe and Latin America, and higher benefits from the 2006 restructuring program are expected to be realized. Higher production and raw material costs and continued growth investments in research, sales and marketing will be moderating factors. 28 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2007 $ 6.6 $ 840 2006 $ 6.3 $ 817 2005 $ 6.1 $ 536 Coatings & Color Technologies is one of the world’s leading automotive coatings suppliers and the world’s largest manufacturer of titanium dioxide white pigments. Products offered include high performance liquid and powder coatings for automotive OEMs, the automotive aftermarket and general industrial applications, such as coatings for heavy equipment, pipes and appliances and electrical insulation. The company markets its refinish products using the DuPonttm, Standox®, Spies Hecker® and Nason® brand names. Standox® and Spies Hecker® are focused on the high-end automotive aftermarkets, while Nason® is primarily focused on economy coating applications. The segment’s broad line of DuPonttm Ti-Pure® titanium dioxide products, in both slurry and powder form, serve the coatings, plastic and paper industries. The segment’s titanium tetrachloride business has moved from a startup business to an established, growing venture, shipping product globally. By mid-2008, the business plans to complete construction and begin operation of a $30 million titanium tetrachloride facility at its titanium dioxide plant in Tennessee. The key markets in which Coatings & Color Technologies operates continued to grow in 2007, with more significant growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. Global demand for titanium dioxide white pigment was strong in 2007 with global market volumes up about 5 percent from 2006. Sales for refinish products increased in all regions. The OEM market realized growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, partially offsetting declines in the U.S. and Canada. This reflects the lower 2007 North American builds of automobiles and light trucks. Powder coatings sales increased in all regions, more significantly in Asia Pacific, U.S. and Europe. Worldwide sales in electrical insulation and metal coatings markets continued to improve. 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $6.6 billion were up 5 percent, reflecting about 4 percent higher USD selling prices for the segment, as well as a 1 percent increase in volume. USD selling prices were higher across a majority of the segment’s products. The increase in volume was primarily attributable to the sales of titanium dioxide, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific. This increase was partially offset by declines in volume for products sold to automotive OEM producers, primarily in North America and Europe. Volumes for sales of refinish products were relatively flat as compared to 2006. PTOI in 2007 of $840 million increased from $817 million in 2006. The PTOI improvement was primarily the result of higher revenue driven by higher USD selling prices and benefits realized from the 2006 restructuring program, partially offset by higher raw material and transportation costs. PTOI in 2006 included a net charge of $132 million for restructuring and $30 million primarily for accelerated depreciation related to the transformation plan that was initiated in the first quarter 2006 (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). These charges were partially offset by $142 million in insurance proceeds, primarily related to the hurricane damages incurred in 2005. 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $6.3 billion were up 4 percent, reflecting about 2 percent higher USD selling prices for the segment. An additional 2 percent increase from volume was primarily realized in the pigments business, reflecting strong global demand as well as the first quarter startup of the DeLisle, Mississippi plant following Hurricane Katrina. Higher selling prices reflected concerted efforts within the segment to increase prices for the majority of its products as part of its efforts to offset the impact of higher raw material costs and the impact of lower global OEM automotive volumes. PTOI in 2006 of $817 million increased from $536 million in 2005. Lower fixed costs in both years and higher volumes in pigments contributed to the improved 2006 earnings. PTOI in 2006 included a net charge of $132 million for restructuring and $30 million primarily for accelerated depreciation. 2006 PTOI also included $142 million in insurance proceeds, primarily related to the hurricane damages suffered in 2005. 2005 PTOI included charges of 29 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued $116 million related to the clean-up and restoration of manufacturing operations, as well as the write-off of inventory and plant assets that were destroyed by hurricanes. Outlook Sales in 2008 are expected to increase modestly, reflecting emerging market growth and pricing actions. Industry demand for titanium dioxide is expected to moderate in 2008, in line with more moderate global economic growth of about 2 percent. Competitive conditions in the global coatings industry will continue to provide a challenging operating environment in 2008. Modest growth is expected for refinish markets in mature economies while strong growth is expected to continue in emerging markets. Profitability of coatings sold to automotive OEM producers is highly dependent upon volume at specific plants the company services. Global automotive industry builds in 2008 are expected to be slightly higher than 2007 with moderate growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, partially offset by slightly lower levels in North America. Significant segment PTOI growth is expected based upon sales growth and cost productivity gains. ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2007 $ 3.8 $ 594 2006 $ 3.6 $ 577 2005 $ 3.4 $ 558 Electronic & Communication Technologies provides a broad range of advanced materials for the electronics industry, flexographic printing and color communication systems and a wide range of fluoropolymer and fluorochemical products. The segment also continues to pursue development activities related to displays and alternative energy.

Electronic & Communication Technologies leverages DuPont’s strong materials and technology base to target growth opportunities in electronics, fluoropolymers, fluorochemicals, packaging graphics, ink-jet and photovoltaic materials. In semiconductor fabrication, packaging and interconnect, the segment is extending and broadening its portfolio of materials to address critical needs in the industry, e.g., chemical mechanical planarization for semiconductor manufacture, flex circuitry and embedded passives enabling miniaturization. In the rapidly growing market for flat panel displays, the segment continues to be a leading materials supplier for plasma displays. In addition, the segment is developing new innovative technologies for liquid crystal displays, such as thermal color filters and display films, while continuing to invest in developing materials technologies for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and field emission displays. In fluoropolymers and fluorochemicals, the segment continues to pursue product renewal innovations such as next generation refrigerants, while broadening the scope of applications into high growth areas such as photovoltaics. In packaging graphics, products such as Cyrel®FASTtm have rapidly grown, solidifying the segment’s market leadership position. Also, DuPont is maintaining its leadership position in black pigmented inks for ink-jet applications. 30 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $3.8 billion were up 6 percent versus 2006, reflecting 5 percent volume growth and 1 percent higher USD selling prices. The volume growth was primarily due to increased demand for fluoroproducts and packaging graphics. Sales growth was strongest outside the U.S. PTOI in 2007 was $594 million, an increase of 3 percent compared to 2006. This increase reflects 5 percent sales volume growth, as well as the benefit of $53 million related to a gain on a land sale and inventory valuation adjustments. These increases were partially offset by higher ingredient and transportation costs, as well as increased fixed cost from growth initiatives. 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $3.6 billion increased about 5 percent over 2005, reflecting 2 percent higher USD prices coupled with a 3 percent improvement in volume. Price improvements reflect higher metals prices primarily for microcircuit materials. Higher volumes reflect increased demand for fluoroproducts and electronic materials. Sales growth was strongest outside the U.S. PTOI in 2006 was $577 million versus $558 million in 2005. Earnings growth in 2006 resulted from improved volume, modest pricing improvement and continued productivity gains. 2005 PTOI included a gain of $48 million on the sale of the company’s remaining interest in DuPont Photomasks, Inc. Outlook For 2008, moderate sales growth is expected with gains in electronic materials, fluoropolymers, and packaging graphics. The segment’s PTOI is expected to reflect moderate sales growth for 2008 versus 2007, modestly offset by investments in new applications, emerging markets and technologies. This segment manufactures products that could be affected by uncertainties associated with PFOA matters. See the discussion on page 44 under the subheading PFOA. PERFORMANCE MATERIALS Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2007 $ 6.6 $ 626 2006 $ 6.2 $ 559 2005 $ 6.1 $ 515 Performance Materials provides productive, higher performance polymer materials, systems and solutions to improve the uniqueness, functionality and profitability of their customers’ offerings. Performance Materials delivers a broad polymer-based materials product portfolio, including thermoplastic and thermoset engineering polymers that are primarily used by customers to fabricate components for mechanical and electrical systems, as well as specialized resins and films used in packaging and industrial applications, sealants and adhesives, sporting goods and interlayers for laminated safety glass.

The key markets served by the segment include the automotive OEM and associated after-market industries, as well as electrical, electronics, packaging, construction and consumer durable goods. The segment’s core competencies are polymer science and applications development focusing on substituting traditional materials with new materials that offer performance, durability, aesthetics and weight reduction advantages. Other areas of focus include new applications and processing materials into innovative parts and systems. A recent example of this core innovation capability is the introduction of Sorona® and Hytrel® resins based on renewable resources which have the performance attributes of high performance engineering resins but are based on plant feedstock. In 2007, certain businesses were realigned to the Performance Materials segment from the Agriculture & Nutrition segment. As a result of reclassifying the 2006 segment information to reflect the 2007 organizational structure, Performance Materials results in 2006 reflect a $72 million restructuring charge related to businesses that were originally included in the 2006 Agriculture & Nutrition restructuring plan (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 31 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued On June 30, 2005, DuPont completed a transaction with Dow related to DuPont Dow Elastomers LLC (DDE), a 50/50 joint venture. Dow acquired from DDE certain assets related to the Engage®, Nordel® and Tyrin® businesses. Upon the completion of this transaction, the remaining elastomers business became a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont and was renamed DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC. In response to a long-term declining demand for the polychloroprene products and the anticipated capital investment requirements at the Louisville, Kentucky facility, the company is consolidating production at its upgraded LaPlace, Louisiana facility. On December 31, 2007, the company initiated the shutdown, abatement and dismantlement process at the Louisville facility. In 2005, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $34 million, reflecting severance and related costs for approximately 275 employees. Cash payouts of $25 million are largely expected to be paid in 2008. Annual cost reductions related to ceasing neoprene production at Louisville and consolidating production at LaPlace are expected to offset reduced revenue related to declining demand. 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $6.6 billion were 7 percent higher than 2006 reflecting 8 percent higher USD selling prices, partly offset by 1 percent lower volume. Sales volume declines reflect the impact of ingredients shortages, temporary operating unit shutdowns and softness in North America, principally in the automotive markets, partly offset by volume improvements in Latin America, Europe and Asia. 2007 PTOI increased 12 percent to $626. 2007 PTOI included an impairment charge of $165 million to write down the company’s investment in a polyester films joint venture. The impairment resulted from several factors, including adverse changes in market conditions and the rapid rise in oil-related raw material costs, which have had a negative impact on the profitability on the venture’s operations in North America and Europe. PTOI in 2006 included a $72 restructuring charge. Improvement in 2007 PTOI was driven by improved pricing, which reflected both the offset of the ingredient cost increases seen during the year and improved product sales mix, and positive currency benefits, offset in part by the weaker volume. The segment is involved in the elastomers antitrust matters and recorded a net $20 charge in 2007 related to these matters (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $6.2 billion were 2 percent higher than 2005 reflecting 3 percent higher USD selling prices, partly offset by 1 percent decline in volume. Sales volume reflects the year over year impact of the businesses transferred to Dow at June 30, 2005. Excluding from 2005 the sales related to assets transferred to Dow ($386 million), sales volumes were up reflecting stronger business environment in Asia and Europe and the recovery from the segment’s business interruption due to the 2005 hurricanes. PTOI in 2006 was $559 million compared to $515 million in 2005. 2006 PTOI included the $72 million restructuring charge. 2005 PTOI included a $17 million hurricane charge, $47 million in operating income related to certain DDE assets sold, a $25 million gain on sale of these DDE assets and a charge of $34 million related to the planned consolidation of the company’s neoprene operations at its LaPlace, Louisiana facility. Outlook Global automotive industry builds in 2008 are expected to be slightly higher than 2007 with moderate growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, partially offset by slightly lower levels in North America. However, the half year pattern is expected to be the reverse of 2007 with higher production in the second half of 2008. Global packaging market growth is expected to remain at current levels. The residential construction market in North America is expected to continue to be weak through 2008, but it is anticipated that the electrical and electronics markets will continue to improve. The 2008 outlook also assumes a second half softening from a weak petrochemical cycle. Revenue growth is expected to continue through volume growth and higher USD selling prices in 2008. PTOI is expected to increase, benefitting from higher revenue, price increases, improved fixed cost performance and customer-driven innovations for products and processes. The level of earnings improvements in 2008 will depend on offsetting the continued high intermediate feedstock costs with price increases and further productivity gains. 32 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued SAFETY & PROTECTION Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2007 $ 5.6 $ 1,199 2006 $ 5.5 $ 1,080 2005 $ 5.1 $ 994 Safety & Protection satisfies the growing global needs of businesses, governments and consumers for solutions that make life safer, healthier and more secure. By uniting market-driven science with the strength of highly regarded brands such as Kevlar®, Tyvek® and Nomex®, Safety & Protection has built a unique presence in the marketplace since its inception in 2002. The segment’s businesses serve customers in diverse markets that include construction, transportation, communications, industrial chemicals, oil and gas, electric utilities, automotive, manufacturing, defense, homeland security and safety consulting. In addition to serving its existing customer base, Safety & Protection is investing in the future by expanding into emerging markets. Over the past two years the segment has achieved strong double-digit growth in Greater China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Safety & Protection is focusing its efforts globally on four major value propositions where it has a distinct competitive advantage: protecting lives, safe and durable buildings, protecting critical processes and protecting the environment. DuPonttm Kevlar® and Nomex® hold strong positions in the life protection markets due to continued demand for body armor and personal protective gear for the military, law enforcement personnel, firefighters and other first responders, as well as for workers in the oil and gas industry and in emerging regions. Global demand for products that prevent disease and improve productivity in the food, health care and industrial markets continue to create growth opportunities for the segment’s clean and disinfect offerings. Additionally, the surfaces protection businesses continue to offer new products that meet demand for sustainable solutions. In 2007, DuPont announced a $500 million investment at its Cooper River site near Charleston, SC, to significantly expand production of DuPonttm Kevlar® brand fiber for industrial and military uses as well as investments in related polymer production. The company also announced a multi-product, multi-region expansion plan to increase worldwide capacity of DuPonttm Nomex®. The company expects to invest more than $100 million in the three-part expansion plan for Nomex®; the first phase was completed in 2007. Safety & Protection continues to strengthen and enhance the building envelope and building interiors with offerings that improve comfort, energy efficiency, air quality and protection from the elements. In 2007, the business introduced 40 new products globally, including new Corian® surfaces and the metalized Tyvek® product family. The business is also taking advantage of substantial growth opportunities in China, India and Eastern Europe while focusing even more on commercial construction and remodeling markets. Through its consulting services businesses, Safety & Protection continued to help organizations worldwide reduce workplace injuries and fatalities while improving operating costs, productivity and quality. DuPont is a leader in the safety consulting field, selling training products, as well as consulting services. Additionally, Safety & Protection is dedicated to clean air, clean fuel, and clean water with offerings that help reduce sulfur and other emissions, formulate cleaner fuels, or dispose of liquid waste. Its goal is to help maintain business continuity and environmental compliance for companies in the refining and petrochemical industries, as well as for government entities. 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $5.6 billion were 3 percent higher than last year, due to higher USD selling prices across all businesses within the platform. Sales volumes remained relatively flat as higher sales of Kevlar® and Nomex® were offset by decreased sales of products for U.S. residential construction markets. PTOI in 2007 was $1,199 million, an increase of 11 percent over the prior year. The increased earnings were primarily due to higher sales of Kevlar® and Nomex®. 2006 PTOI included a $47 million asset impairment charge related to an industrial chemical asset held for sale, partially offset by a $33 million benefit from insurance proceeds. 33 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 2006 versus 2005 Sales of $5.5 billion were up 7 percent due to 5 percent higher USD prices and 2 percent higher volumes. All businesses in the platform grew sales year over year with the strongest growth in chemical solutions and aramids. Segment sales experienced slower U.S. growth as a result of shifts in demand for construction, but were offset by higher sales growth in other regions, especially emerging regions. PTOI in 2006 was $1,080 million, up 9 percent from $994 million in the prior year. The increase in PTOI reflects pricing gains and tight fixed cost control. 2006 PTOI included a $47 million asset impairment charge related to an industrial chemical asset held for sale, partially offset by a $33 million benefit from insurance proceeds. Outlook Safety & Protection will continue to drive growth in its product lines globally with the strength of its brands. U.S. and global demand for Kevlar® and Nomex® is expected to remain strong. The personal protection, medical packaging and medical fabrics market segments are expected to grow during the year. Volume declines in the U.S. residential construction market will continue, but are expected to be mitigated by continued growth, in commercial, remodel and non-U.S. construction markets. Overall, continued revenue growth and moderate earnings growth in 2008 is expected based on continued market penetration, the introduction of new products and technologies and continued investment in its growth initiatives. PHARMACEUTICALS Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2007 $ - $ 949 2006 $ - $ 819 2005 $ - $ 751 On October 1, 2001, DuPont Pharmaceuticals was sold to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. DuPont retained its interest in Cozaar® (losartan potassium) and Hyzaar® (losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide). These drugs were discovered by DuPont and developed in collaboration with Merck and are used in the treatment of hypertension. The U.S. patents covering the compounds, pharmaceutical formulation and use for the treatment of hypertension, including approval for pediatric use, will expire in 2010. DuPont has exclusively licensed worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights for Cozaar® and Hyzaar® to Merck. Pharmaceuticals receives royalties and net proceeds as outlined below. Merck is responsible for manufacturing, marketing and selling Cozaar® and Hyzaar®. Pharmaceuticals’ Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income is the sum of two parts derived from a royalty on worldwide contract Net sales linked to the exclusivity term in a particular country, and a share of the profits from North American sales and certain markets in Europe, regardless of exclusivity term. Patents and exclusivity have already started to expire and the U.S. exclusivity for Cozaar® ends in April 2010. The worldwide agreement terminates when the following conditions are met: (i) the Canadian exclusivity ends in 2013, and (ii) North American sales fall below a certain level. Therefore, absent any major changes in the markets, the company expects its income to take its first significant step-down in 2010, and from that year on, continue to step-down each year to zero when the contract ends, which is expected to be after 2013. The company cannot predict the magnitude of the earnings step-down in each year. In general, management expects a traditional sales and earnings decline for a drug going off patent in the pharmaceutical industry. Outlook DuPont and Merck continue to support Cozaar® and Hyzaar® with clinical studies designed to identify additional therapeutic benefits for patients with hypertension and co-morbid conditions. The company expects the ongoing Cozaar®/Hyzaar® collaboration to continue to be an important contributor to earnings until the U.S. patents expire in 2010. Thereafter, earnings are expected to decline significantly as outlined above. OTHER The company includes embryonic businesses not included in the growth platforms, such as applied biosciences and nonaligned businesses in Other. Applied biosciences is focused on the development of biotechnology solutions using biology, chemistry, materials science and engineering in an integrated fashion to serve our customers. Specific growth projects across the company globally are consolidated within applied biosciences to capitalize on the market 34 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued opportunities and technology needs in this high-growth industry, including crop-based products and technologies, the biorefinery initiative with the U.S. Department of Energy and the development of advanced biofuels technologies through a collaboration with BP p.l.c. The first advanced biofuels product from this partnership will be biobutanol. DuPont partnered with Tate & Lyle PLC to produce 1,3-propanediol (Bio-PDOtm) using a proprietary fermentation and purification process based on corn sugar. Bio-PDOtm is the key building block for DuPonttm Sorona® polymer and DuPonttm Cerenoltm polyols, two new families of renewably sourced products. It is also being marketed for use as an ingredient in nearly a dozen direct applications ranging from industrial to personal care uses. The first commercial-scale plant to manufacture Bio-PDOtm began production in November 2006, marking the beginning of commercial availability of the company’s bio-based pipeline. A life cycle assessment of the production of nylon-6 polymer versus the production of renewably sourced Sorona® with Bio-PDOtm shows significant environmental benefits. The Sorona® process uses 30 percent less energy than nylon-6 manufacturing. Greenhouse gas emissions from the Sorona® operations are 63 percent lower than nylon-6 manufacturing including bio-based content stored in the product. Nonaligned businesses include activities and costs associated with Benlate® fungicide and other discontinued businesses and, since January 2005, activities related to the remaining assets of Textiles & Interiors. In 2005, the company completed the transfer of three equity affiliates to Koch and sold its interest in another equity affiliate. In January 2006, the company completed the sale of its interest in an equity affiliate to its equity partner for proceeds of $14 million thereby completing the sale of all the net assets of Textiles & Interiors. In the aggregate, sales in Other for 2007, 2006 and 2005 represent less than 1 percent of total segment sales. PTOI in 2007 was a loss of $224 million compared to a loss of $173 million in 2006. The 29 percent increase in the pretax loss was primarily due to higher inventory, freight and business development costs. PTOI in 2007 included litigation charges for former businesses of $69 million. PTOI in 2006 included a charge of $27 million to write down certain specialty resins manufacturing assets to estimated fair value. PTOI in 2006 was a loss of $173 million compared to a loss of $90 million in 2005. The losses in 2006 are reflective of the concentration of activities in applied biosciences and include the $27 million charge to write down certain specialty resins manufacturing assets to estimated fair value. PTOI in 2005 included a net gain of $62 million related to the disposition of equity affiliates, primarily associated with the Textiles & Interiors separation. Liquidity & Capital Resources Management believes that the company’s ability to generate cash and access the capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments and other cash needs for the foreseeable future. The company’s liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: Cash provided by operating activities, Cash and cash equivalents, Marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. The company’s current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings provide excellent access to the capital markets. Pursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities balances of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2007, provide primary liquidity to support all short-term obligations. In the unlikely event that the company would not be able to meet its short-term liquidity needs, the company has access to approximately $4.3 billion in credit lines with several major financial institutions. These credit lines are primarily multi-year facilities. The company continually reviews its debt portfolio for appropriateness and occasionally may rebalance it to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum maturity debt schedule. 35 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued The company’s long term and short term credit ratings have not changed over the last three year ends and are as follows: Long term Short term Outlook Standard & Poor A A-1 Stable Moody’s Investor Services A2 P-1 Negative Fitch Ratings A F1 Stable (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Cash provided by operating activities $ 4,290 $ 3,736 $ 2,542 The company’s Cash provided by operating activities was $4.3 billion in 2007, a $554 million increase from the $3.7 billion generated in 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher earnings after adjusting for noncash items. Net income for 2006 included noncash tax benefits totaling $615 million (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) While the change in net working capital was essentially flat year over year, the company did realize productivity gains in inventory days supply and days payable outstanding. However, days sales outstanding slightly increased. The company’s Cash provided by operating activities was $3.7 billion in 2006, a $1.2 billion increase from the $2.5 billion generated in 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher net income in 2006 and a reduction in contributions made to pension plans, partially offset by the timing of tax payments. Working capital productivity measures of days sales outstanding and inventory days supply were essentially flat in 2006 versus 2005, while days payable outstanding slightly decreased. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Cash used for investing activities $ (1,750 ) $ (1,345 ) $ (602 ) In 2007, Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion used in 2006. The $405 million increase was mainly due to the settlement of forward exchange contracts and a slight increase in capital spending, partially offset by higher proceeds from sales of assets. Due to the impact of a weakening USD, the settlement of forward exchange contracts issued to hedge the company’s net exposure, by currency, related to monetary assets and liabilities resulted in the payment of $285 million in 2007 versus the receipt of $45 million in 2006. The forward exchange contract settlements were largely offset by the revaluation of the items being hedged, which are reflected in the appropriate categories in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2006, Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.3 billion compared to $602 million used in 2005. The increase reflects higher purchases of property, plant and equipment and lower proceeds from the sale of assets. In addition, due to the impacts of a weakening USD, the settlement of forward exchange contracts issued to hedge the company’s net exposure, by currency, related to monetary assets and liabilities resulted in the receipt of $45 million in 2006 versus the receipt of $653 million in 2005. These settlements were largely offset by revaluation of the items being hedged, which are reflected in the appropriate categories in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The company expects 2008 purchases of plant, property and equipment to be higher than 2007 levels. This incremental spending is primarily based on the company’s previously announced investments in Kevlar®, Nomex® and titanium dioxide. 36 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Cash used for financing activities $ (3,069 ) $ (2,323 ) $ (2,851 ) The $746 million increase in Cash used for financing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to the company’s share repurchase activity, partially offset by the increase in proceeds from stock options exercised. The $528 million decrease in Cash used for financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the company’s borrowings and share repurchase activity. Total debt at December 31, 2007 was $7.3 billion, a $205 million decrease from December 31, 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of borrowings related to the 2005 AJCA cash repatriation program, partially offset by the issuance of $750 million in 5 year notes in December 2007. Total debt at December 31, 2006 was $7.5 billion, a $650 million decrease from December 31, 2005. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of borrowings related to the 2005 AJCA cash repatriation program, partially offset by the issuance of $1 billion in 10 and 30 year notes in December 2006. Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.4 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.52, $1.48 and $1.46 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The common dividend declared in the first quarter 2008 was the company’s 414th consecutive dividend since the company’s first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904. The company’s Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share buyback plan in June 2001. During 2005, the company purchased and retired 9.9 million shares at a total cost of $505 million. During 2007 and 2006, there were no purchases of stock under this program. As of December 31, 2007, the company has purchased 20.5 million shares at a total cost of $962 million. Management has not established a timeline for the buyback of the remaining shares of stock under this plan. In October 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan. In October 2005, the company repurchased 75.7 million shares of its common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement and paid $3.0 billion for the repurchase. Upon the conclusion of the agreement in 2006, the company paid $180 million in cash to Goldman, Sachs & Co. to settle the agreement. Additionally, in 2006, the company made open market purchases of its shares for $100 million. In 2007, the company purchased 34.7 million shares for $1.7 billion, thereby, completing this program. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of shares activity. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005. The $457 million decrease from 2006 to 2007 is primarily due to the company’s share repurchase activity, as well as cash used to meet other business requirements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee Contracts Indemnifications The company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures and related business activities prior to the completion of the transactions. The terms of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and product liabilities, are generally indefinite. In addition, the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, against liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the company, such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters. If the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally indeterminable. The carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $101 million and $105 million, respectively. Although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed 37 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued amounts accrued, due to the nature of indemnified items, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist. In connection with the sale of INVISTA, the company indemnified the purchasers, subsidiaries of Koch, against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal and environmental matters and other representations and warranties under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Koch has presented claims under these indemnities which the companies are discussing; however, DuPont disagrees with Koch’s presentation. The estimated fair value of the indemnity obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement is $70 million and is included in the indemnifications balance of $101 million at December 31, 2007. The fair value was based on management’s best estimate of the value expected to be required to issue the indemnifications in a standalone, arm’s length transaction with an unrelated party and, where appropriate, by the utilization of probability weighted discounted net cash flow models. The company does not believe that these indemnities will have a material impact on the future liquidity of the company (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Obligations for Equity Affiliates and Others The company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates, customers, suppliers and other affiliated and unaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2007, the company had directly guaranteed $583 million of such obligations, plus $121 million relating to guarantees of obligations for divested subsidiaries and affiliates. This represents the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees. The company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. At December 31, 2007, a current liability of $135 million had been recorded for these obligations, principally related to obligations of the company’s polyester films joint venture which are guaranteed by the company. No additional material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. Existing guarantees for customers, suppliers and other unaffiliated companies arose as part of contractual agreements. Existing guarantees for equity affiliates and other affiliated companies arose for liquidity needs in normal operations. In certain cases, the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers. The company has guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities related to divested subsidiaries including Conoco and its subsidiaries and affiliates and Consolidation Coal Sales Company. The Restructuring, Transfer and Separation Agreement between DuPont and Conoco requires Conoco to use its best efforts to have Conoco, or any of its subsidiaries, substitute for DuPont. Conoco and Consolidation Coal Sales Company have indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2007, the company had no liabilities recorded for these obligations. Additional information with respect to the company’s guarantees is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees. Master Operating Leases At December 31, 2007, the company has one master operating lease program relating to miscellaneous short-lived equipment valued at approximately $119 million. Lease payments for these assets totaled $59 million in 2007, $58 million in 2006 and $51 million in 2005, and were reported as operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statements. The leases under this program are considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Furthermore, the lease payments associated with this program vary based on one month LIBOR. The company may terminate the program at any time by purchasing the assets. Should the company decide neither to renew the leases nor to exercise its purchase option, it must pay the owner a residual value guarantee amount, which may be recovered from a sale of the property to a third party. Residual value guarantees totaled $104 million at December 31, 2007. 38 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Contractual Obligations Information related to the company’s significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In Total at December 31, 2009 – 2011 – 2013 and (Dollars in millions) 2007 2008 2010 2012 beyond Long-term and short-term debt 1 $ 5,966 $ 21 $ 2,437 $ 414 $ 3,094 Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity 2,497 320 474 359 1,344 Capital leases 1 13 3 4 1 5 Operating leases 1,020 328 324 209 159 Purchase obligations 2 Information technology infrastructure & services 123 68 36 14 5 Raw material obligations 685 260 208 120 97 Utility obligations 438 140 106 75 117 INVISTA-related obligations 3 821 351 199 183 88 Human resource services 327 18 38 91 180 Other 4 23 22 - - 1 Total purchase obligations 2,417 859 587 483 488 Other liabilities 1,5 Workers’ compensation 75 13 38 12 12 Asset retirement obligations 62 9 26 13 14 Environmental remediation 357 84 114 69 90 Legal settlements 70 38 26 6 - License agreement 6 703 110 180 179 234 Other 7 119 21 25 15 58 Total other long-term liabilities 1,386 275 409 294 408 Contractual tax obligations 8 80 80 - - - Total contractual obligations $ 13,379 $ 1,886 $ 4,235 $ 1,760 $ 5,498 1 Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement. 3 Includes raw material supply obligations of $744 million and contract manufacturing obligations of $77 million. 4 Primarily represents obligations associated with distribution, health care/benefit administration, research and development and other professional and consulting contracts. 5 Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have been excluded from the table as they are discussed below within Long-Term Employee Benefits. 6 Represents remaining expected payments under a license agreement between Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. and Monsanto Company. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 7 Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other postretirement benefits. 8 Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the remaining estimate of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations should unforeseen circumstances arise. 39 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Long-Term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company’s earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability and life insurance protection for employees. Approximately 80 percent of the company’s worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company’s worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company’s non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits. Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees’ pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans’ actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. By law, no contributions are currently required to be made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2008 and no contributions are currently anticipated. Contributions beyond 2008 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. In 2007, the company contributed $277 million to its pension plans. The company anticipates that it will make approximately $250 million in contributions in 2008 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. in August 2006. The Act introduces new funding requirements for single-employer defined benefit pension plans, provides guidelines for measuring pension plan assets and pension obligations for funding purposes, introduces benefit limitations for certain underfunded plans and raises tax deduction limits for contributions to retirement plans. The new funding requirements are generally effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. The company does not anticipate that the Act will have a material impact on its required contributions. In August 2006, the company announced major changes to its principal U.S. pension plan and principal defined contribution plan. As part of this announcement, the defined contribution benefits for most U.S. employees are in transition. Effective January 1, 2007, for employees hired on that date or thereafter, and effective January 1, 2008, for active employees on the rolls as of December 31, 2006, the company will make a contribution of 100 percent of the first 6 percent of the employee’s contribution election. Additionally, the company will contribute 3 percent of each eligible employee’s compensation regardless of the employee’s contribution election. The definition of eligible compensation has also been expanded to be similar to the definition of eligible compensation in the U.S. pension plan. Covered full service employees on the rolls as of December 31, 2006 will also accrue additional benefits in the pension plan, but the annual rate of pension accrual will be about one-third of the previous rate. In addition, company-paid postretirement survivor benefits for these employees will not continue to grow after December 31, 2007. Covered employees hired in the U.S. after December 31, 2006 will not participate in the pension plan. As a result of the amendment to the principal U.S. pension plan, the company was required to remeasure its pension expense for the remainder of 2006, reflecting plan assets and benefit obligations as of the remeasurement date. As a result of better than expected return on plan assets and a higher discount rate of 6 percent as of the remeasurement date, pretax pension expense decreased by $72 million for 2006. For 2007, the plan amendment resulted in a reduction in pension expense of about $40 million. For 2008, the plan amendment is expected to result in a net 40 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued reduction of approximately $40 million in combined pension and defined contribution plans expense. This estimate is composed of a reduction in pension expense of about $190 million, partially offset by an increase in defined contribution plan expense of approximately $150 million. Actual cash contributions for the savings plan will increase less than $130 million in 2008. Additional information related to these changes in the plans noted above is included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On December 31, 2006, the company adopted SFAS 158 and recorded a $1,555 million after-tax charge to stockholder’s equity primarily due to reclassifying unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs related to the pension plans. Medical, dental, life insurance and disability plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $315 million, $335 million and $408 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $315 million in 2008. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles. The company’s income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company’s income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pretax charges and credits related to long-term employee benefits. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Defined benefit pension charges $ (54 ) $ 191 $ 432 Company contributions to defined contribution plans 99 86 81 Other long-term employee benefit charges 192 155 237 Net amount $ 237 $ 432 $ 750 The above charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in pension expense in 2007 reflects favorable returns on pension assets, plan amendments and changes in demographics and discount rates. The increase in 2007 other long-term employee benefit charges principally reflects changes in demographics, discount rates and higher than expected health care costs. The decrease in pension expense in 2006 reflects favorable returns on pension assets, plan amendments and changes in discount rates. The decrease in 2006 other long-term employee benefit charges principally reflects the favorable medical trends in 2005 and refinements in estimates to reflect the anticipated commencement of the Medicare prescription drug program. The company’s key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2008, lower than anticipated medical trends, the net impact of the U.S. retirement plan amendments, changes in demographics and discount rates, and the expiration of a prior service cost amortization credit in 2007 are expected to result in a reduction in pension and other long-term employee benefit pretax expenses of about $170 million. Environmental Matters DuPont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, DuPont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, eliminate the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of waste water discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future. While these costs may increase in the future, they are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 41 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Pretax environmental expenses charged to current operations totaled $576 million in 2007 compared with $521 million in 2006 and $468 million in 2005. These expenses include the remediation accruals discussed below; operating, maintenance and depreciation costs for solid waste, air and water pollution control facilities and the costs of environmental research activities. While expenses related to the costs of environmental research activities are not a significant component of the company’s overall environmental expenses, the company expects these costs to become proportionally greater as the company increases its participation in businesses for which environmental assessments are required during product development. The largest of the environmental expenses in 2007 was $113 million for the operation of water pollution control facilities and $131 million for solid waste management. About 78 percent of total annual environmental expenses resulted from operations in the U.S. In 2007, DuPont spent approximately $110 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $150 million in 2008. In the U.S., significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures. Total CAA capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from $40 million to $70 million. The goal of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is to prevent unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment associated with the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of chemical substances. Under TSCA, the EPA has established reporting, record-keeping, testing and control-related requirements for new and existing chemicals. In 1998, the EPA challenged the U.S. chemical industry to voluntarily conduct screening level health and environmental effects testing on nearly 3,000 high production volume (HPV) chemicals or to make equivalent information publicly available. An HPV chemical is a chemical listed on the 1990 Inventory Update Rule with annual U.S. cumulative production and imports of one million pounds or more. The company expects to complete its commitments regarding the HPV chemicals it volunteered to sponsor within the next two to three years. In December 2006, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals. This regulatory framework known as REACH entered into force on June 1, 2007. One of its main objectives is the protection of human health and the environment. REACH requires manufacturers and importers to gather information on the properties of their substances that meet certain volume or toxicological criteria and register the information in a central database to be maintained by a Chemical Agency in Finland. The Regulation also calls for the progressive substitution of the most dangerous chemicals when suitable alternatives have been identified. Pre-registration will occur between June 1, 2008 and November 30, 2008; complete registrations containing extensive data on the characteristics of the chemical will be required in 2010 if production usage or tonnage exceeds 1,000 metric tons per year; 2013 if it is between 100 and 1,000 metric tons per year; and 2018 if it is 100 metric tons per year or less. By June 1, 2013, the Commission will review whether substances with endocrine disruptive properties should be authorized if safer alternatives exist. By June 1, 2019, the Commission will determine whether to extend the duty to warn from substances of very high concern to those that could be dangerous or unpleasant. Management does not expect that the costs to comply with REACH will be material to its operations and consolidated financial position. DuPont believes that climate change is an important global issue that will present numerous risks and opportunities to business and society at large. Since the early 1990s when DuPont began taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the company has achieved major global reductions in emissions. Voluntary emissions reductions implemented by DuPont and other companies are valuable but alone will not be sufficient to effectively address a problem of this scale. The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in February 2005 and, while not ratified by the U.S., has spurred policy action by many other countries and regions around the world including the European Union. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of a post-2012 international policy framework to guide international action to address climate change when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect the company’s energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. However, the successful negotiation and implementation of sensible national, 42 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued regional, and international climate change policies could provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. The company actively manages the potential risks that climate change could present, including those associated with the company’s physical assets, as well as with regulatory and economic issues. DuPont looks for opportunities to make its overall portfolio less energy intensive, and energy use is one factor that is weighed when investments or divestitures are considered. DuPont is committed to continuing to bring to market more products and services to meet new and expanded demands of a low-carbon economy. DuPont has discovered that very low levels of dioxins (parts per trillion to low parts per billion) and related compounds are inadvertently generated during its titanium dioxide pigment production process. Over 99 percent of the dioxin generated at DuPont’s production plants becomes associated with process solid wastes that are disposed in controlled landfills where public exposure is negligible. A multi-year research and process engineering development program has culminated in capital projects and other process modifications intended to reduce dioxin generation by at least 90 percent. The last of these projects and process modifications were completed during 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the company’s operations had results verifying the capability to reduce dioxin generation by 90 percent. Remediation Expenditures The RCRA extensively regulates and requires permits for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination at the facility. If conditions warrant, companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, the costs of the RCRA corrective action program are typically borne solely by the company. The company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required over the next two decades. Annual expenditures for the near term, however, are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. The company’s expenditures associated with RCRA and similar remediation activities were approximately $47 million, $44 million and $49 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. From time to time, the company receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a PRP under CERCLA or similar state statutes. CERCLA is often referred to as the Superfund and requires companies to undertake certain investigative and research activities at sites where it conducts or once conducted operations or where company generated waste has been disposed. The company has also, on occasion, been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company’s past operations. As of December 31, 2007, the company had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA or state laws at 383 sites around the U.S., with active remediation under way at 139 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at 161 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in “de minimis buyouts” with other PRPs whose waste, like the company’s, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at six new sites during 2007 compared with six similar notices in 2006 and eight in 2005. The company’s expenditures associated with CERCLA and similar state remediation activities were approximately $20 million, $19 million and $27 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For nearly all Superfund sites, the company’s potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other PRPs is relatively low. Other PRPs at sites, where the company is a party, typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and, where they do not, or where PRPs cannot be located, the company’s own share of liability has not materially increased. There are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant and the cost to the 43 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued company of remediation at those sites and at all CERCLA sites in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Total expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws were $68 million, $64 million and $79 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Remediation Accruals At December 31, 2007, the Consolidated Balance Sheets included an accrued liability of $357 million compared to $349 million at December 31, 2006. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2007. Of the $357 million accrued liability, approximately 10 percent was reserved for non-U.S. facilities. Approximately 65 percent of the reserve balance was attributable to RCRA and similar remediation liabilities, while about 25 percent was attributable to CERCLA liabilities. Remediation accruals of $76 million, $71 million and $64 million were added to the reserve in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. PFOA DuPont manufactures fluoropolymer resins and dispersions as well as fluorotelomers, marketing many of them under the Teflon® and Zonyl® brands. The fluoropolymer resins and dispersions businesses are part of the Electronic & Communication Technologies segment; the fluorotelomers business is part of the Safety & Protection segment. Fluoropolymer resins and dispersions are high-performance materials with many end uses including architectural fabrics, telecommunications and electronic wiring insulation, automotive fuel systems, computer chip processing equipment, weather-resistant/breathable apparel and non-stick cookware. Fluorotelomers are used to make soil, stain and grease repellants for paper, apparel, upholstery and carpets as well as firefighting foams and coatings. A form of PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) is used as a processing agent to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. For over 50 years, DuPont purchased its PFOA needs from a third party, but beginning in the fall of 2002, it began producing PFOA to support the manufacture of fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. PFOA is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC (DPE) uses PFOA in the manufacture of raw materials to manufacture Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer parts. PFOA is also used in the manufacture of some fluoroelastomers marketed by DPE under the Viton® trademark. The wholly owned subsidiary is a part of the Performance Materials segment. PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. As a result, the EPA initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources of PFOA in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to PFOA is occurring. In 2003, the EPA issued a preliminary risk assessment on PFOA that focuses on the exposure of the U.S. general population to PFOA and possible health effects, including developmental toxicity concerns. On January 12, 2005, the EPA issued a draft risk assessment on PFOA. The draft stated that cancer data for PFOA may be best described as “suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential” under the EPA’s Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. Under the Guidelines, the descriptor “suggestive” is typically applied to agents if animal testing finds any evidence that exposure causes tumors in one species of animal. The EPA requested that the Science Advisory Board (SAB) review and comment on the scientific soundness of this assessment. On May 31, 2006, the SAB released its report setting forth the view, based on laboratory studies in rats, that the human carcinogenic potential of PFOA is more consistent with the EPA’s descriptor of “likely to be carcinogenic” as defined in the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. However, in its report the SAB indicated that additional data should be considered before the EPA finalizes its risk assessment of PFOA. Under the Guidelines the “likely” descriptor is typically applied to agents that have tested positive in more than one species, sex, strain, site or exposure route with or without evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. The EPA has acknowledged that it will consider additional data, including new research and testing, and has indicated that another SAB review will be sought after the EPA makes its risk assessment. DuPont disputes the cancer classification recommended in the 44 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued SAB report. The EPA has stated that it is premature to draw any conclusions on the potential risks, including cancer, from PFOA until the additional data are integrated into the risk assessment. Although the EPA has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks associated with PFOA, it also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any products because of concerns about PFOA. DuPont respects the EPA’s position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of PFOA and DuPont and other companies have outlined plans to continue research, emission reduction and product stewardship activities to help address the EPA’s questions. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to the EPA’s 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. In October 2007, (for the year 2006), DuPont reported to the EPA that it had achieved an almost 98 percent reduction of PFOA emissions in U.S. manufacturing facilities. About a 95 percent reduction was achieved in global manufacturing emissions, meeting the EPA 2010 objective well ahead of the timeline. DuPont will work individually and with others in the industry to inform EPA’s regulatory counterparts in the European Union, Canada, China and Japan about these activities and PFOA in general, including emissions reductions from DuPont’s facilities, reformulation of the company’s fluoropolymer dispersions and new manufacturing processes for fluorotelomers products. In February 2007, DuPont announced its commitment to eliminate the need to make, use or buy PFOA by 2015. DuPont has discovered technology that should enable the elimination of PFOA use in fluoropolymer production. Commercial scale quantities of some fluoropolymer products have been made without PFOA and customers were notified in the fourth quarter 2007 that these products will be available for testing in their processes in 2008. Also, DuPont is developing the next generation of fluorotelomer products and already introduced two of them in the fourth quarter 2007. In the meantime, DuPont has developed Echelontm technology that can reduce the PFOA content in fluoropolymer dispersions by 97 percent. The company has already converted 90 percent of its product line by volume to manufacturing processes based on Echelontm. DuPont also has successfully commercialized a new, patented manufacturing process to remove greater than 97 percent of trace by-product levels of PFOA, its homologues and direct precursors from its fluorotelomer products. The new products are being marketed as LX Platformtm products. In November 2006, DuPont entered into an Order on Consent under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) with the EPA establishing a precautionary interim screening level for PFOA of 0.5 part per billion (ppb) in drinking water sources in the area around the Washington Works site located in Parkersburg, West Virginia. DuPont is required under the agreement to offer to install water treatment systems or an EPA-approved alternative if PFOA levels are detected at or above 0.5 ppb. In February 2007, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) identified a preliminary drinking-water guidance level for PFOA of 0.04 ppb as part of the first phase of an ongoing process to establish a state drinking-water standard. While the NJDEP will continue sampling and evaluation of data from all sources, it has not recommended a change in consumption patterns. While occupational exposure to PFOA has been associated with small increases in some lipids (e.g. cholesterol), it is not known whether these are causal associations. These associations were not observed in a community study. Based on health and toxicological studies, DuPont believes the weight of evidence indicates that PFOA exposure does not pose a health risk to the general public. To date, there are no human health effects known to be caused by PFOA, although study of the chemical continues. Currently, there are no regulatory actions pending that would prohibit the production or use of PFOA. However, because there continues to be regulatory interest, there can be no assurance that the EPA or any other regulatory entity will not choose to regulate or prohibit the production or use of PFOA in the future. Products currently manufactured by the company representing approximately $1 billion of 2007 revenues could be affected by any such regulation or prohibition. DuPont has established reserves in connection with certain PFOA environmental and litigation matters (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 45 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments Under procedures and controls established by the company’s Financial Risk Management Framework, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions, petrochemical and petroleum companies and exchanges. The company hedges foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, certain business-specific foreign currency exposures and certain energy feedstock purchases. In addition, the company enters into exchange traded agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge exposures relevant to agricultural feedstock purchases. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments, accounts receivable and derivatives. As part of the company’s risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The company’s sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. As of December 31, 2007, no one individual customer balance represented more than 5 percent of the company’s total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company’s global businesses. The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. Foreign Currency Risk The company’s objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes. Accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities and commitments. The company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are minimized. The following table summarizes the impacts of this program on the company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 2005 Pretax exchange (loss)/gain $ (85 ) $ (4 ) $ 445 Tax (expense)/benefit 54 (26 ) (483 ) After-tax loss $ (31 ) $ (30 ) $ (38 ) This table includes the company’s pro rata share of its equity affiliates’ exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on forward exchange contracts. 46 Table of Contents Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk continued From time to time, the company will enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Forward exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements and to place foreign currency deposits and marketable securities investments. Interest Rate Risk The company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on USD LIBOR. Interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. Commodity Price Risk The company enters into over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. A portion of energy feedstock purchases are hedged to reduce price volatility using fixed price swaps and options. Hedged feedstock purchases include natural gas and ethane. The company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory. Under these contracts, growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the market price of grain for a period of time following harvest. Derivative instruments, such as commodity futures that have a high correlation to the underlying commodity, are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers. The company utilizes agricultural commodity futures to manage the price volatility of soybean meal. These derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk. Additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sensitivity Analysis The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the market prices or rates that existed at December 31, 2007 and 2006. The sensitivity for interest rate swaps is based on a one percent change in the market interest rate. Foreign currency, agricultural and energy derivative sensitivities are based on a 10 percent change in market rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “projects,” “estimates” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company’s strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures and financial results are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events. The company cannot guarantee that these assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. For some of the important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 6. Overview Long-term Growth Strategies – DuPont strives to grow shareholder value over the long term by executing its three growth strategies – Putting Science to Work, Leveraging the Power of One DuPont and Going Where the Growth Is. DuPont science and innovation is focused on delivering solutions for some of the world’s toughest challenges such as the need for increased food production, renewable energy and raw materials, energy efficiency, and greater safety and protection. The initiatives employed to achieve the strategies are: #1 Grow in the areas of agriculture, biosciences, safety and protection and polymer science by delivering science-based solutions. #2 Expand the company’s position in emerging markets. #3 Extend cost and capital productivity gains. Over the long term, DuPont continues to see the potential for attractive earnings growth from these initiatives. In addition to its growth strategies, DuPont’s financial discipline principles are critical to delivering shareholder value over time. The principles are first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth. The company’s strong balance sheet supports liquidity and a low cost of borrowing and is a direct result from the disciplined execution of these principles. Global Economic Conditions – The year 2008 was challenging due to a global economic recession with demand weakness in North American and Western European motor vehicle and construction related markets and dramatic escalation of global raw material, energy and transportation costs. Despite these challenges, the company delivered 4 percent sales growth and strong performances from the Agriculture & Nutrition segment, Pharmaceuticals, and most businesses in emerging markets. Early in the fourth quarter 2008 a financial crisis spreading globally triggered unprecedented market volatility and depressed economic growth. The fourth quarter of 2008 was the clear pivot point in the economic environment with a steep decline in demand becoming pervasive across a broader range of end markets and geographies. Reflecting these conditions, the company’s full year sales volume dropped 5 percent versus the prior year. Response to Challenging Global Market Conditions – In December 2008, DuPont announced plans to address rapidly deteriorating market conditions and strengthen the company’s future competitiveness. Plans are focused on generating cash by better aligning cost, working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditures to the revised demand signals of the fourth quarter. These plans include a restructuring program with an associated fourth quarter pre-tax charge of $535 million, with expected pre-tax savings of about $130 million for 2009, and about $250 million annual savings thereafter. The restructuring will reduce about 2,500 employee positions, primarily those associated with motor vehicle and construction related businesses in Western Europe and the U.S. In addition to the expected $130 million cost savings in 2009 from restructuring, the company detailed plans to deliver an additional $600 million cost reduction in 2009. These plans include fixed cost productivity improvements, as well as immediate cost reductions implemented across the company such as significantly reducing discretionary spending, temporarily idling over 100 sites, reducing about 4,000 contractors and continuing productivity projects for streamlining and leveraging opportunities across operations, supply chain and support functions. The company also outlined 2009 plans to achieve a $1 billion net working capital reduction, and a 10 to 20 percent reduction in capital spending. 18 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Analysis of Operations (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 NET SALES $ 30,529 $ 29,378 $ 27,421 2008 versus 2007 Consolidated net sales for 2008 were $30.5 billion, up 4 percent. This reflects 10 percent sales growth through September 30, partly offset by a 17 percent year-over-year sales decline in the fourth quarter, precipitated by a significant decline in demand. Full year sales reflect a 7 percent increase in local selling prices and 3 percent favorable currency exchange, partly offset by 5 percent lower volume and a 1 percent reduction from portfolio changes. Worldwide sales volumes reflect a modest increase outside the U.S. driven by growth in emerging markets, more than offset by significantly lower volumes in the company’s major polymer, chemical, material, and electronic product lines sold in the U.S. and Western Europe. The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2008 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year: Percent Change Due to: Percent 2008 Change vs. Local Currency (Dollars in billions) Net Sales 2007 Price Effect Volume Portfolio Worldwide $ 30.5 4 7 3 (5 ) (1 ) United States 11.0 (2 ) 8 - (10 ) - Europe 9.5 8 5 7 (4 ) - Asia Pacific 5.5 6 6 2 - (2 ) Canada & Latin America 4.5 9 9 4 (3 ) (1 ) 2007 versus 2006 Consolidated net sales for 2007 were $29.4 billion, up 7 percent. This growth was principally the result of an 11 percent increase in sales outside of the U.S., reflecting in part the benefit of a weaker U.S. dollar (USD), which added 3 percent to worldwide sales. Worldwide volumes and local selling prices each increased 2 percent. Sales in the U.S. increased 1 percent reflecting 3 percent higher selling prices, partially offset by 2 percent lower volume. The decrease in U.S. sales volume was primarily due to lower demand for the company’s products related to construction and motor vehicle production markets. Sales in Canada and Latin America increased 15 percent, primarily due to a 10 percent volume increase reflecting a substantial increase in sales of seed and crop protection products in South America.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 OTHER INCOME, NET $ 1,307 $ 1,275 $ 1,561 2008 versus 2007 Other income, net, increased $32 million versus 2007. The increase was attributable to an increase of $211 million in equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to the absence of the 2007 impairment charge described below, and a favorable $51 million litigation settlement in 2008. The increases are partially offset by additional net pre-tax exchange losses of $154 million and a decrease of $86 million in asset sales. 2007 versus 2006 Other income, net, decreased $286 million versus 2006. This reduction is primarily due to an impairment charge of $165 million to write down the company’s investment in a polyester films joint venture in the Performance Materials segment, a decrease of $81 million in net pre-tax exchange gains and a decrease in miscellaneous items of $231 million offset by higher Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income of $128 million (see page 33 for Pharmaceuticals segment information and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The decrease in miscellaneous items resulted from the absence of 2006 benefits of $90 million for the reversal of accrued interest related to the favorable settlement of certain prior-year tax contingencies and $76 million of insurance recoveries from its insurance carriers as part of asbestos litigation matters. Of the $76 million, $61 million related to costs, including outside counsel fees and expenses and settlements paid over the past twenty years. During this twenty year period, DuPont has been served with thousands of lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to asbestos on DuPont premises. Most of these claims have been disposed of through trial, dismissal or settlement. Management believes it is remote that the outcome of remaining or future asbestos litigation matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity. These asbestos related insurance recoveries were reflected in cash provided by operating activities within the company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The remaining $15 million is part of a total recovery of $143 million relating to insurance recoveries associated with damages to the company’s facilities suffered as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The majority of the Hurricane Katrina recovery was included in cost of goods sold and other operating charges in the Consolidated Income Statements. No amounts were received from insurance carriers for damages suffered by the company as a result of Hurricane Rita. Additional information related to the company’s other income, net is included in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

COGS was 79 percent of net sales for 2008 versus 74 percent for the year 2007. The 5 percentage point increase principally reflects a $535 million charge for restructuring as discussed below, a $227 million charge for hurricane-related cleanup and repair, and significant increases in raw material, energy and freight costs. In 2008, the company initiated a global restructuring program in response to the decline in the motor vehicle and construction markets, as well as the global economic recession. The program was established to reduce costs and improve profitability across the company’s businesses. The program includes the elimination of approximately 2,500 positions principally located in Western Europe and the U.S. primarily supporting the motor vehicle and construction markets. A resulting charge of $535 million has been reflected in COGS. This charge includes costs of $287 million related to employee severance costs and $248 million attributable to asset shut-downs, asset impairments and other non-personnel charges. Additional details related to this program are contained in the individual segment reviews and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Essentially all employee terminations related to this program will begin during the first quarter of 2009. The program is estimated to be substantially complete in 2010. There were no cash payments related to this program in 2008. Expected pre-tax cost savings of approximately $250 million per year are associated with the program when complete. Approximately $130 million of this savings is expected to be realized in 2009. 2007 versus 2006 COGS for the year 2007 were $21.7 billion, versus $20.6 billion in 2006, an increase of 5 percent. COGS was 74 percent of net sales for 2007 versus 75 percent for the year 2006. The 1 percentage point reduction principally reflects the absence of 2006 charges for restructuring, the effects of the company’s productivity initiatives and a current year benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar due to currency exchange rate changes which increased sales at a higher rate than the rate they increased COGS. Partly offsetting these factors were increases in raw material and finished product distribution costs, as well as the absence of a 2006 benefit of $128 million in insurance recoveries. The 2006 restructuring programs included the elimination of approximately 3,200 positions and redeployment of about 650. The company recorded a net charge of $326 million in 2006 related to employee separation costs and asset impairment charges. This included $184 million to provide severance benefits for approximately 2,800 employees involved in manufacturing, marketing and sales, administrative and technical activities. At December 31, 2008, the 2006 restructuring programs are essentially complete. Additional details related to these programs are contained in the segment reviews and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Payments from operating cash flows to terminated employees as a result of the 2006 plans totaled $47 million, $77 million, and $32 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Annual pre-tax cost savings of about $125 million per year are associated with the Coatings & Color Technologies program, approximately $53 million of which is reflected in COGS. Cumulative savings of approximately 100 percent, 80 percent and 35 percent was realized in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $ 3,593 $ 3,396 $ 3,255 As a percent of net sales 12 % 12 % 12 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percent of sales remained constant over the three year period. Higher SG&A is primarily due to increased global commissions, selling and marketing investments related to the company’s seed products and an unfavorable foreign currency impact.

Higher R&D in 2008 and 2007 relates to the accelerated biotechnology trait research and development in the Agriculture & Nutrition segment. The 2007 increase was partially offset by a decrease in R&D in the Coatings & Color Technologies segment as a result of consolidating research facilities as a part of its 2006 business transformation plan. 21 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 INTEREST EXPENSE $ 376 $ 430 $ 460 Interest expense decreased $54 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in interest expense is due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. Interest expense decreased $30 million in 2007 versus 2006. This decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowing levels and higher capitalized interest, partially offset by slightly higher average interest rates. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES $ 381 $ 748 $ 196 Effective income tax rate 15.9 % 20.0 % 5.9 % In 2008, the company recorded a tax provision of $381 million (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2007, the company recorded a tax provision of $748 million which included a benefit of $108 million related to tax settlements offset by net tax expense in other operating results (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2006, the company recorded a tax provision of $196 million which included a benefit of $272 million related to tax settlements and a $186 million benefit for reversal of tax valuation allowances related to the net deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries due to the sustained improved business performance in these subsidiaries. These tax benefits were offset by net tax expense in other operating results (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The company’s current estimate of the 2009 effective income tax rate is about 26 percent, excluding tax effects of exchange gains and losses which can not be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 6 for additional detail on items that significantly impact the company’s effective tax rates. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 NET INCOME $ 2,007 $ 2,988 $ 3,148 2008 versus 2007 Net income for 2008 decreased $981 million, or 33 percent versus 2007. The decrease in net income is attributable to a substantial decline in sales volume, primarily occurring during the fourth quarter 2008, and higher fixed costs including restructuring and hurricane-related charges recorded in the fourth quarter 2008. 2007 versus 2006 Net income for 2007 decreased 5 percent versus 2006, primarily due to the higher effective tax rate, as well as the decrease in other income. These decreases were partially offset by a 7 percent increase in net sales, the absence of the restructuring charges taken in 2006 and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Corporate Outlook For the year 2009, the company’s earnings outlook is a range of $2.00 to $2.50 per share, anticipating that the global economic recession will adversely affect the company’s results. Favorable global agriculture market and competitive conditions are expected to support continued sales and earnings growth for the Agriculture & Nutrition segment. However, lower demand for the company’s major polymer, chemical, material, and electronic product lines and the impact of currency are expected to limit the company’s overall revenue growth. The company plans to continue its appropriate level of support for businesses expected to have above-average growth rates and margins. In addition, cash-generating actions have been implemented including spending reductions and restructuring to better align capital expenditures and costs with anticipated continuing lower global demand. For 2009, the company has set targets for capital expenditures of about $1.6 billion, and fixed cost and working capital reductions of about $730 million and $1 billion respectively. 22 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 (revised 2007) “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141R) which replaces SFAS No. 141. SFAS 141R addresses the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in business combinations. SFAS 141R also requires disclosure that enables users of the financial statements to better evaluate the nature and financial effect of business combinations. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R will be adopted by the company on January 1, 2009. The company does not believe that at the time of adoption SFAS 141R will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard requires significantly different accounting treatment for business combinations than current requirements. Thus, accounting for potential future business combinations after adoption may produce a significantly different result and financial statement impact than under current standards. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements – an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (SFAS 160) which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also clarifies that a third-party, non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 also requires disclosure that clearly identifies and distinguishes between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 will be adopted by the company on January 1, 2009. The company does not believe that at the time of adoption SFAS 160 will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS 161). Effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, the new standard requires enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities that are intended to better convey the purpose of derivative use and the risks managed. SFAS 161 will not affect the company’s financial position or results of operations. The new standard solely affects the disclosure of information. In December 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets,” which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The new standard expands disclosures for assets held by employer pension and other postretirement benefit plans. FSP FAS 132(R)-1 will not affect the company’s financial position or results of operations. The new standard solely affects the disclosure of information. Critical Accounting Estimates The company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the Unites States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company’s accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Long-term Employee Benefits Accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company’s 23 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan obligations or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining working life of current employees. About 80 percent of the company’s benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company’s other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. The company utilizes published long-term high quality bond indices to determine the discount rate at the balance sheet date. Where commonly available, the company considers indices of various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy and projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than their fair market value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair market value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company’s calculation of net pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair market value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan: (Dollars in billions) 2008 2007 Market-related value of assets $ 16.2 $ 19.3 Fair market value of plan assets $ 13.5 $ 19.1 Market-related value of plan assets decreased during 2008 due to recent adverse conditions in the global capital markets. For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is typically determined using the fair market value of assets. The fair market value of assets in all pension plans was $16.2 billion at December 31, 2008, and the related projected benefit obligations were $21.5 billion. In addition, obligations under the company’s unfunded other long-term employee benefit plans were $4.1 billion at December 31, 2008. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company’s pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company’s pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2008: 1/2 Percentage Point 1/2 Percentage Point (Dollars in millions) Increase Decrease Discount Rate $66 $(68 ) Expected rate of return on plan assets 92 (92 ) Additional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under “Long-Term Employee Benefits” beginning on page 39. Environmental Matters DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company’s estimates are based on a number of factors, including the 24 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. The company has recorded a liability of $379 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued. Much of this liability results from the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, often referred to as the Superfund), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and similar state laws. These laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. Federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations and could, among other things, impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company-generated waste disposal. Over the next two decades, the company could incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of PRPs. Therefore, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. Legal Contingencies The company’s results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company’s experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter’s current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The breadth of the company’s operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the ultimate taxes the company will pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company’s tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant, however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and the possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made. 25 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material. At December 31, 2008, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $6,524 million, net of valuation allowance of $1,693 million. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. Valuation of Assets Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company’s normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management’s best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company’s businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. Future changes in the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges. Based on the results of the company’s annual impairment test in 2008, no impairments exist at this time. However, due to the global recession, there has been a reduction in the fair values in excess of book value of net assets within goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Future changes in the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could result in an increase or decrease of excess fair values of book value, or impairment charges. Information with respect to the company’s significant accounting policies on long-lived assets is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Reviews Segment sales include transfers. Segment pre-tax operating income (PTOI) is defined as operating income before income taxes, minority interests, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and net interest. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated net sales and segment PTOI to income before income taxes and minority interests for 2008, 2007 and 2006 is included in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company initiated a global restructuring program during 2008 to reduce costs and improve profitability across its businesses. The program charge reduced 2008 segment PTOI as follows: Agriculture & Nutrition – $18 million; Coatings & Color Technologies – $236 million; Electronic & Communication Technologies – $55 million; Performance Materials – $94 million; Safety & Protection – $101 million; and Other – $31 million. 26 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2008 $ 8.0 $ 1,087 2007 $ 6.8 $ 894 2006 $ 6.0 $ 604 Agriculture & Nutrition leverages the company’s technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply. Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited. Therefore, increases in production will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted acreage. Agriculture & Nutrition delivers a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. The segment operates across the food value chain from inputs for producing agriculture products to global production and distribution of soy-based food ingredients to food quality diagnostic testing equipment. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and enhance the value of grains and soy through improved seed traits, superior germplasm and the effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Agriculture & Nutrition includes the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. (Pioneer), which is also the world’s leading seed brand and a world leader in improving crop yields with hybrid and varietal seeds that improve grower yields and provide insect protection and herbicide tolerance. The principal products of Pioneer are hybrid seed corn and soybean seed. In 2008, Pioneer benefited from the global launch of approximately 30 new soybean varieties and 60 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids that include new combinations of corn borer, corn rootworm and weed management traits highlighted by the expansion of the Herculex®1 family of traits. Agriculture & Nutrition also serves the global production agriculture industry with crop protection products in the grain and specialty crop sectors, forestry and vegetation management. Principal crop protection products are herbicides, fungicides, insect control products and plant growth regulators. The segment continued to expand its presence in fruit and vegetable specialty markets and continues to expand product offerings in the professional pest control market. Additionally, the segment operates within the specialty food ingredients market, including soy proteins and lecithins through its majority-owned venture with Bunge Limited, The Solae Company. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $8 billion were 16 percent higher reflecting 14 percent higher USD selling prices and 3 percent higher volume, partially offset by a 1 percent reduction from portfolio changes. The volume growth reflects higher corn seed sales in Europe and Brazil, record soybean seed sales in North America and Brazil due to market share gains and increased acreage shift from corn, and strong demand for corn and cereal herbicides and cereal fungicides in Europe. The higher USD selling prices reflect higher value product mix, pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs and favorable currency impacts in Europe, Latin America and Canada. PTOI for 2008 was $1.1 billion, up 22 percent versus $894 million in 2007, principally driven by increased sales and higher value product mix, partially offset by continued funding of strategic growth investments in research and development and sales and marketing. 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $6.8 billion were 14 percent higher reflecting 9 percent higher USD selling prices and a 5 percent increase in volume. Higher USD selling prices reflected a richer mix of corn and soybean seed, and crop protection herbicides and fungicides. Volume increases were driven by corn seed sales in North America, herbicides in Europe and fungicides in Latin America, partially offset by a decrease in the sale of soybean seed on lower planting acreage in North America. 1 Registered Trademark of Dow AgroSciences LLC 27 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 2007 PTOI was $894 million versus $604 million in 2006. 2006 PTOI included a $122 million restructuring charge. In addition, 2007 PTOI benefited from sales volume and price gains, partially offset by higher production costs across most of the segment and the growth investment in the seed business. Outlook In 2009, the segment anticipates continued growth through increased Pioneer corn value offerings, including stacked traits and seed treatments in the U.S. and Canada. Pioneer will continue to build on its North American product offerings with the addition of 26 new soybean varieties and 96 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids. Pioneer anticipates price increases from higher value product mix and continued market share gains in key soybean and corn markets including the U.S., Canada and Brazil. The segment’s introduction of new crop protection products is projected to drive volume gains, particularly in Europe and Latin America. Higher production and raw material costs and negative currency impacts will be moderating factors in the underlying results. COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2008 $ 6.6 $ 326 2007 $ 6.6 $ 840 2006 $ 6.3 $ 817 Coatings & Color Technologies is one of the world’s leading motor vehicle coatings suppliers and the world’s largest manufacturer of titanium dioxide products. Products offered include high performance liquid and powder coatings for motor vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the motor vehicle aftermarket, and general industrial applications, such as coatings for heavy equipment, pipes and appliances and electrical insulation. The company markets its refinish products using the DuPonttm, Standox®, Spies Hecker® and Nason® brand names. Standox® and Spies Hecker® are focused on the high-end motor vehicle aftermarkets, while Nason® is primarily focused on economy coating applications. The segment’s broad line of DuPonttm Ti-Pure® titanium dioxide products, in both slurry and powder form, serve the coatings, plastic and paper industries. The segment’s titanium tetrachloride business has moved from a startup to an established, growing business, shipping product globally. In 2008, construction was completed and operations began at a $30 million titanium tetrachloride facility at its titanium dioxide plant in Tennessee. The key markets in which Coatings & Color Technologies operates continued to grow for most of the year, with growth in the emerging regions, offset by significant decline in demand across the segment during the last four months of 2008 as the industry supply chains destocked worldwide in response to the global economic recession. Global demand for titanium dioxide products was down in 2008 with global market volumes down 5 percent from 2007. Sales for refinish products increased in all regions, except the U.S. The OEM market realized growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, however this was more than offset by significant declines in Europe, U.S., and Canada as a result of lower builds of automobiles and light trucks in 2008. Industrial coatings sales increased in most regions outside the U.S. and Canada, with larger increases in Asia Pacific and Latin America. In December 2008, as part of the company’s restructuring plan, the segment recorded a charge of $236 million that included costs for employee separations and asset related charges and will cover the elimination of approximately 1,600 positions and the closure of certain manufacturing units. The plan is expected to be completed in 2010 and will result in cost savings of approximately $50 million in 2009, with an annual savings rate of approximately $140 million. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $6.6 billion were flat when compared to 2007, reflecting 8 percent higher USD selling prices, offset by an 8 percent volume decline. The higher USD selling prices primarily reflect favorable currency impacts in Europe and Latin America and pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs. The decrease in volume was primarily due to lower sales of products sold to OEMs in North America and Europe and lower demand for titanium dioxide, partially offset by strong sales in emerging markets. 28 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued 2008 PTOI was $326 million as compared to $840 million in 2007. Year-over-year decline in PTOI reflects the restructuring charge described above, as well as the impact of higher raw material costs and lower volumes, partially offset by higher prices and strong sales in emerging markets. 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $6.6 billion were up 5 percent, reflecting about 4 percent higher USD selling prices for the segment, as well as a 1 percent increase in volume. USD selling prices were higher across a majority of the segment’s products. The increase in volume was primarily attributable to the sales of titanium dioxide, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific. This increase was partially offset by declines in volume for products sold to OEM producers, primarily in North America and Europe. Volumes for sales of refinish products were relatively flat as compared to 2006. PTOI in 2007 of $840 million increased from $817 million in 2006. The PTOI improvement was primarily the result of higher revenue driven by higher USD selling prices and benefits realized from the 2006 restructuring program, partially offset by higher raw material and transportation costs. PTOI in 2006 included a net charge of $132 million for restructuring and $30 million primarily for accelerated depreciation related to the transformation plan that was initiated in the first quarter 2006 (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). These charges were partially offset by $142 million in insurance proceeds, primarily related to the hurricane damages incurred in 2005. Outlook Sales in 2009 are expected to decrease, reflecting continued weakness due to the global recession. Industry demand for titanium dioxide is expected to be lower in 2009, with continued weakness in North American and European construction and motor vehicle markets. Conditions in the global coatings industry will continue to provide a challenging operating environment in 2009. Modest declines are expected for refinish markets in mature economies while modest growth is expected in emerging markets. Profitability of coatings sold to OEM producers is highly dependent upon volume at specific plants the company services. Global motor vehicle industry builds in 2009 are expected to be down from 2008 with all regions showing declines. Lower raw material cost, fixed cost benefits from the company’s 2008 restructuring program and productivity initiatives are expected to partially offset the impact of lower volumes. ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2008 $ 4.0 $ 436 2007 $ 3.8 $ 594 2006 $ 3.6 $ 577 Electronic & Communication Technologies provides a broad range of advanced materials for the electronics industry, inks and flexographic printing systems, and a wide range of fluoropolymer and fluorochemical products.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued materials. In semiconductor fabrication, packaging and interconnects, the segment is extending and broadening its portfolio of materials to address critical needs in the industry, e.g., chemical mechanical planarization and cleaners for semiconductor manufacture; flex circuitry, advanced dielectric films and embedded passives enabling miniaturization. In the growing market for flat panel displays, the segment continues to be a leading materials supplier for plasma displays. In addition, the segment is developing new innovative technologies for liquid crystal displays, such as alternative backlighting materials and display films, while continuing to invest in developing materials technologies for organic light-emitting diode (OLED). In fluoropolymers and fluorochemicals, the segment continues to pursue product renewal innovations such as next generation refrigerants. In the fast growing photovoltaics market, the segment continues to be a leading supplier of conductors and fluoropolymer films for crystalline silicon cell and module manufacturers and is adding new products to serve the emerging thin film photovoltaic module market. In packaging graphics, products such as Cyrel®FAST have rapidly grown, solidifying the segment’s market leadership position. DuPont is also expanding its leadership position in black pigmented inks, and investing in color pigmented inks for network printing applications. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $4 billion were up 5 percent, reflecting 7 percent higher USD selling prices, 3 percent volume decline and a 1 percent increase from portfolio changes. The higher USD selling prices mainly reflect pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs and favorable currency impacts in Europe and Asia Pacific. The lower volumes reflect decreased demand for products across the segment key markets, mostly towards the end of 2008, partially offset by increased demand for photovoltaic products and higher sales in emerging markets. PTOI was $436 million as compared to $594 million in 2007. This decline was mainly driven by higher raw materials cost, lower sales volumes and the impact of the $55 million charge for the 2008 restructuring program. 2007 PTOI also includes a benefit of $53 million related to a gain on a land sale and inventory valuation adjustments. 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $3.8 billion were up 6 percent versus 2006, reflecting 5 percent volume growth and 1 percent higher USD selling prices. The volume growth was primarily due to increased demand for fluoroproducts and packaging graphics. Sales growth was strongest outside the U.S. PTOI in 2007 was $594 million, an increase of 3 percent compared to 2006. This increase reflects 5 percent sales volume growth, as well as the benefit of $53 million related to a gain on a land sale and inventory valuation adjustments. These increases were partially offset by higher ingredient and transportation costs as well as increased fixed cost from growth initiatives. Outlook For 2009, sales for electronic materials, fluoroproducts, and packaging graphics products will be impacted by the global recession. Continued growth in the photovoltaics market, cost control initiatives and benefits from the 2008 restructuring program will partially offset the effect of lower volumes. This segment manufactures products that could be affected by uncertainties associated with PFOA matters. See the discussion on page 43 under the subheading PFOA. PERFORMANCE MATERIALS Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2008 $ 6.4 $ 128 2007 $ 6.6 $ 626 2006 $ 6.2 $ 559 Performance Materials provides productive, higher performance polymers, elastomers, films, parts, and systems and solutions which improve the uniqueness, functionality and profitability of its customers’ offerings.

Key brands include DuPonttm Zytel® nylon resins, Delrin® acetal resins, Hytrel® polyester thermoplastic elastomer resins, Vespel® parts and shapes, Tynex® filaments, Surlyn® resins, Vamac® ethylene acrylic elastomer, 30 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued SentryGlas® Plus and Butacite® laminate interlayers, Mylar® and Melinex® polyester films, Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer and Viton® fluoroelastomers. The key markets served by the segment include the automotive OEM and associated after-market industries, as well as electrical, electronics, packaging, construction, oil, photovoltaics, aerospace, chemical processing and consumer durable goods. The segment’s core competencies include global market knowledge and access in key growth industries, local technical support in all major regions to help customers solve their problems, world class polymer science, material science and applications development, scientists working to solve customer problems, world class manufacturing which provides high quality reliable products, and a broad, tested, product portfolio which successfully substitutes traditional materials with solutions which offer performance, total systems cost reductions, sustainability, durability, aesthetics and weight reduction advantages. Other areas of focus include new applications and processing materials into innovative parts and systems. A recent example of this core innovation capability is the introduction of Hytrel® resins based on renewable resources which have the performance attributes of high performance engineering resins but are based on plant feedstock. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $6.4 billion were 3 percent lower, driven by a 13 percent decrease in volume and a 1 percent reduction from portfolio changes, which more than offset 11 percent higher USD selling prices. Sales volume declines were more pronounced beginning late in the third quarter, with continued and accelerated deterioration through the fourth quarter, and occurred in all major regions and end-use market segments. The decline reflects a broad industry movement to reduce inventory and improve cash positions to manage through what is projected to be a protracted period of weak global economic demand. Volumes were also negatively impacted by extended operating unit shutdowns related to the time taken to implement facility repairs stemming from damages associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Operating units outages associated with the hurricanes were of varying lengths depending on the level of damage incurred and the ability to obtain utilities and ingredients to enable a restart. 2008 PTOI was $128 million compared to $626 million in 2007. 2008 PTOI includes charges related to hurricane damages of $216 million. In addition, as part of the company’s restructuring program, the segment recorded a charge of $94 million to cover employee termination costs and other assets related charges. The decline in PTOI was also influenced by charges associated with low capacity utilization of production units to reduce inventories due to the decreased demand. The decrease in PTOI in 2008 was partially offset by the absence of a $165 million impairment charge in 2007 to write down the company’s investment in a polyester films joint venture. 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $6.6 billion were 7 percent higher than 2006 reflecting 8 percent higher USD selling prices, partly offset by 1 percent lower volume. Sales volume declines reflect the impact of ingredients shortages, temporary operating unit shutdowns and softness in North America, principally in the automotive markets, partly offset by volume improvements in Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific. 2007 PTOI increased 12 percent to $626 million. 2007 PTOI included an impairment charge of $165 million to write down the company’s investment in a polyester films joint venture. The impairment resulted from several factors, including adverse changes in market conditions and the rapid rise in oil-related raw material costs, which have had a negative impact on the profitability on the venture’s operations in North America and Europe. Improvement in 2007 PTOI was driven by improved pricing, which reflected both the offset of the ingredient cost increases seen during the year and improved product sales mix, and positive currency benefits, offset in part by the weaker volume. The segment is involved in the elastomers antitrust matters and recorded a net $20 million charge in 2007 related to these matters (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Outlook Global motor vehicle industry builds in 2009 are expected to decline. Most of the markets served by the segment are expected to remain soft in 2009. The 2009 outlook also assumes a softening from a weak petrochemical cycle. Revenue is also expected to decline in part due to lower production capacity and negative currency impacts, partially offset by higher local currency average selling prices. PTOI is expected to decline, as benefits from lower average ingredient prices, improved fixed cost performance, benefits from the company’s 2008 31 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued restructuring program and customer-driven innovations for products and processes are projected to be offset by soft global demand. SAFETY & PROTECTION Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2008 $ 5.7 $ 829 2007 $ 5.6 $ 1,199 2006 $ 5.5 $ 1,080 Safety & Protection satisfies the growing global needs of businesses, governments and consumers for solutions that make life safer, healthier and more secure. By uniting market-driven science with the strength of highly regarded brands such as Kevlar®, Tyvek®, Nomex® and Corian®, Safety & Protection has built a unique presence in the marketplace since its inception in 2002. The segment’s businesses serve customers in diverse markets that include construction, transportation, communications, industrial chemicals, oil and gas, electric utilities, automotive, manufacturing, defense, homeland security and safety consulting. In addition to serving its existing customer base, Safety & Protection is investing in the future by expanding into emerging markets. Over the past two years the segment has achieved strong double-digit growth in Greater China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Safety & Protection is focusing its efforts globally on four major value propositions where it has a distinct competitive advantage: protecting lives, safe and durable buildings, protecting critical processes and protecting the environment. DuPonttm Kevlar® and Nomex® hold strong positions in life protection markets due to continued demand for body armor and personal protective gear for the military, law enforcement personnel, firefighters and other first responders, as well as for workers in the oil and gas industry and in emerging regions. Global demand for products that prevent disease and improve productivity in the food, health care and industrial markets continue to create growth opportunities for the segment’s clean and disinfect offerings. Additionally, the surfaces protection businesses continue to offer new products that meet demand for sustainable solutions. Safety & Protection continues to strengthen the building envelope and building interiors with offerings that improve comfort, energy efficiency, air quality and protection from the elements. In 2008, new products introductions from the Corian® and Tyvek® product families solidified the segment’s market position globally, while enhancing the presence on commercial construction and remodeling markets. In the consulting services market, Safety & Protection continued to help organizations worldwide reduce workplace injuries and fatalities while improving operating costs, productivity and quality. DuPont is a leader in the safety consulting field, selling training products, as well as consulting services. Additionally, Safety & Protection is dedicated to clean air, clean fuel, and clean water with offerings that help reduce sulfur and other emissions, formulate cleaner fuels, or dispose of liquid waste. Its goal is to help maintain business continuity and environmental compliance for companies in the refining and petrochemical industries, as well as for government entities. In 2007, DuPont announced a $500 million investment at its Cooper River site near Charleston, South Carolina and $50 million at its Spruance site in Richmond, Virginia, to significantly expand production of DuPonttm Kevlar® brand fiber for industrial and military uses as well as investments in related polymer production. The company also announced a multi-product, multi-region expansion plan to increase worldwide capacity of DuPonttm Nomex®. The company expects to invest more than $100 million in the three-part expansion plan for Nomex®. The second phase was completed in 2008. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $5.7 billion were 2 percent higher than last year, due to 9 percent higher USD selling prices, offset by a 5 percent decline in volume and a 2 percent reduction from a divested business. Decreased volume primarily reflects lower sales to the U.S. residential and construction markets and the automotive industry, which accelerated and spread to other key markets during the fourth quarter. The higher USD selling prices primarily 32 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued reflect pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs and positive currency impact in Europe and Latin America. 2008 PTOI was $829 million compared to $1,199 million in 2007. The decreased earnings were primarily due to higher production costs and the impact of lower volumes related to the global recession. In addition, 2008 PTOI includes a charge of $101 million to cover employee separation costs and other asset related charges as part of the company restructuring program. 2007 versus 2006 Sales of $5.6 billion were 3 percent higher than 2006, due to higher USD selling prices across all businesses within the segment. Sales volumes remained relatively flat as higher sales of Kevlar® and Nomex® were offset by decreased sales of products for U.S. residential construction markets. PTOI in 2007 was $1,199 million, an increase of 11 percent over the prior year. The increased earnings were primarily due to higher sales of Kevlar® and Nomex®. 2006 PTOI included a $47 million asset impairment charge related to an industrial chemical asset held for sale, partially offset by a $33 million benefit from insurance proceeds. Outlook For 2009, sales will be affected by the impact of the global recession. Demand for Kevlar® and Nomex® is expected to increase moderately with public sector sales growth offset by continued weakening in the motor vehicle and personal protection markets. The building envelope market segments are expected to decline due to global market weakness and continued volume declines in the U.S. and European residential construction markets. Earnings in 2009 will include benefits from the restructuring actions announced in 2008. PHARMACEUTICALS Segment Sales PTOI (Dollars in billions) (Dollars in millions) 2008 $ - $ 1,025 2007 $ - $ 949 2006 $ - $ 819 On October 1, 2001, DuPont Pharmaceuticals was sold to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. DuPont retained its interest in Cozaar® (losartan potassium) and Hyzaar® (losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide). These drugs were discovered by DuPont and developed in collaboration with Merck and are used in the treatment of hypertension. The U.S. patents covering the compounds, pharmaceutical formulation and use for the treatment of hypertension, including approval for pediatric use, will expire in 2010. DuPont has exclusively licensed worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights for Cozaar® and Hyzaar® to Merck. Pharmaceuticals receives royalties and net proceeds as outlined below. Merck is responsible for manufacturing, marketing and selling Cozaar® and Hyzaar®. Pharmaceuticals’ Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income is the sum of two parts derived from a royalty on worldwide contract net sales linked to the exclusivity term in a particular country, and a share of the profits from North American sales and certain markets in Europe, regardless of exclusivity term. Patents and exclusivity have already started to expire and the U.S. exclusivity for Cozaar® ends in April 2010. The worldwide agreement terminates when the following conditions are met: (i) the Canadian exclusivity ends in 2013, and (ii) North American sales fall below a certain level. Therefore, absent any major changes in the markets, the company expects its income to take its first significant step-down in 2010, and from that year on, continue to step-down each year to zero when the contract ends, which is expected to be after 2013. The company cannot predict the magnitude of the earnings step-down in each year. In general, management expects a traditional sales, earnings and cash decline for a drug going off patent in the pharmaceutical industry. Outlook DuPont and Merck continue to support Cozaar® and Hyzaar® with clinical studies designed to identify additional therapeutic benefits for patients with hypertension and co-morbid conditions. The company expects the ongoing Cozaar®/Hyzaar® collaboration to continue to be an important contributor to earnings and cash until the U.S. patents expire in 2010. Significant declines are expected thereafter as outlined above. 33 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued OTHER The company includes embryonic businesses not included in the growth segments, such as applied biosciences and nonaligned businesses in Other. The potential viability of each embryonic business depends on a number of factors including successful product development, market acceptance and production ramp up capabilities. Using these factors and others, management periodically assesses the potential and fit of these businesses and may make investment adjustments based on such assessments. Applied biosciences is focused on the development of biotechnology solutions using biology, chemistry, materials science and engineering in an integrated fashion to serve our customers. Specific global growth projects across the company are consolidated within applied biosciences to capitalize on the market opportunities and technology needs in this high-growth industry, including biomaterial and biospeciality products and technologies and advanced biofuels. Applied biosciences will provide advantaged products for agricultural energy crops, feedstock processing and advanced biofuels through two businesses: one to commercialize non-food, cellulosic ethanol and the second to commercialize biobutanol. To accelerate commercialization, DuPont has formed a joint venture with Danisco, DuPont Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol LLC, for the cellulosic ethanol technology. For biobutanol, a partnership was created in 2006 with BP p.l.c. DuPont partnered with Tate & Lyle PLC to produce 1,3-propanediol (Bio-PDOtm) using a proprietary fermentation and purification process based on corn sugar. Bio-PDOtm is the key building block for DuPonttm Sorona® polymer and DuPonttm Cerenoltm polyols, two new families of renewably sourced products. Under the Zemea® propanediol and Susterra® propanediol brands, it is also being marketed for use as an ingredient in nearly a dozen direct applications ranging from industrial to personal care uses. The first commercial-scale plant to manufacture Bio-PDOtm began production in November 2006, marking the beginning of commercial availability of the company’s bio-based pipeline. Nonaligned businesses include activities and costs associated with Benlate® fungicide and other discontinued businesses and, since January 2005, activities related to the remaining assets of the former Textiles & Interiors segment. In 2004, the company sold a majority of the net assets of Textiles and Interiors to subsidiaries of Koch Industries, Inc. (INVISTA). In 2005, the company completed the transfer of three equity affiliates to INVISTA and sold its interest in another equity affiliate. In January 2006, the company completed the sale of its interest in an equity affiliate to its equity partner for proceeds of $14 million thereby completing the sale of all the net assets of Textiles & Interiors. In the aggregate, sales in Other for 2008, 2007 and 2006 represent less than 1 percent of total segment sales. PTOI in 2008 was a loss of $181 million compared to a loss of $224 million in 2007. The improvement for the year was mainly due to a benefit of $51 million from a litigation settlement in 2008 and the absence of a $69 million charge recorded in 2007 for litigation related to a discontinued business. PTOI in 2007 was a loss of $224 million compared to a loss of $173 million in 2006. The 29 percent increase in the pre-tax loss was primarily due to higher inventory, freight and business development costs. PTOI in 2007 included litigation charges for former businesses of $69 million. PTOI in 2006 included a charge of $27 million to write down certain specialty resins manufacturing assets to estimated fair value. Liquidity & Capital Resources Despite the global economic recession and adverse conditions in the global capital markets, management believes the company’s ability to generate cash from operations, coupled with cost reduction initiatives and access to capital markets, will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, debt maturities and other cash needs. The company’s liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. The company’s current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings have not been materially impacted by the current credit environment. In addition, cash generating actions have been implemented including spending reductions and restructuring to better align capital expenditures and costs with anticipated continuing lower global demand. However, there can be no assurance that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by 34 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued the ongoing credit market instability. The company will continue to monitor the financial markets in order to respond to changing conditions. Pursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2008, provide primary liquidity to support all short-term obligations. The company has access to approximately $2.7 billion in credit lines with several major financial institutions, as additional support to meet short term liquidity needs. These credit lines are primarily multi-year facilities. The $1.6 billion decrease from the $4.3 billion in credit lines at December 31, 2007 is primarily due to the expiration of credit lines obtained to support the company’s cash repatriation program under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The company continually reviews its debt portfolio and occasionally may rebalance it to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum maturity debt schedule. The company’s long term and short term credit ratings are as follows: Long term Short term Outlook Standard & Poor A A-1 Negative Moody’s Investors Service A2 P-1 Negative Fitch Ratings A F1 Stable Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s recently affirmed the company’s A2/A long term and P-1/A-1 short term ratings, respectively. Additionally, they revised their outlooks to negative from stable. The company does not expect these actions to impact liquidity or cost of debt. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash provided by operating activities $ 3,129 $ 4,290 $ 3,736 The company’s cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2008, a $1.2 billion decrease from the $4.3 billion generated in 2007. The decrease is primarily due to lower earnings and the impact of the stronger dollar on working capital items, which was hedged by forward exchange contracts in investing activities. The company’s cash provided by operating activities was $4.3 billion in 2007, a $554 million increase from the $3.7 billion generated in 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher earnings after adjusting for noncash items. Net income for 2006 included noncash tax benefits totaling $615 million (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash used for investing activities $ (1,610 ) $ (1,750 ) $ (1,345 ) In 2008, cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion used in 2007. The $140 million decrease was mainly due to higher proceeds from forward exchange contract settlements, partially offset by increased capital expenditures, lower proceeds from asset sales and higher expenditures for businesses acquired. In 2007, cash used for investing activities totaled $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion used in 2006. The $405 million increase was mainly due to the settlement of forward exchange contracts and a slight increase in capital spending, partially offset by higher proceeds from sales of assets. Due to the impact of a weakening USD, the settlement of forward exchange contracts issued to hedge the company’s net exposure, by currency, related to monetary assets and liabilities resulted in the payment of $285 million in 2007 versus the receipt of $45 million in 2006. The forward exchange contract settlements were largely offset by the revaluation of the items being hedged, which are reflected in the appropriate categories in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 35 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $2.0 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This incremental spending is primarily based on the company’s previously announced investments in Kevlar® and Nomex®. The company expects 2009 purchases of plant, property and equipment to be $1.6 billion. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 878 $ (3,069) $ (2,323) The $3.9 billion increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to the increase in the net proceeds from borrowings and the absence of the purchase of common stock, which were partly offset by the decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options. During the fourth quarter of 2008, interest rate swaps were terminated with a combined notional amount of $1.25 billion for cash proceeds of $226 million, which are classified within financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This gain will be amortized to earnings as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the debt, through 2018. The $746 million increase in cash used for financing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to the company’s share repurchase activity, partially offset by the increase in proceeds from stock options exercised. Total debt at December 31, 2008 was $9.7 billion, a $2.4 billion increase from December 31, 2007. The proceeds from the increased borrowings were invested in cash equivalents and used for general corporate purposes. Total debt at December 31, 2007 was $7.3 billion, a $205 million decrease from December 31, 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the repayment of borrowings related to the 2005 AJCA cash repatriation program, partially offset by the issuance of $750 million in 5 year notes in December 2007. Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.5 billion in 2008, and $1.4 billion in 2007 and 2006. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.64, $1.52 and $1.48 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The common dividend declared in the first quarter 2009 was the company’s 418th consecutive dividend since the company’s first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904. The company’s Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share buyback plan in June 2001. During 2005, the company purchased and retired 9.9 million shares at a total cost of $505 million. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, there were no purchases of stock under this program. As of December 31, 2008, the company has purchased 20.5 million shares at a total cost of $962 million. Management has not established a timeline for the buyback of the remaining shares of stock under this plan. In October 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan. In October 2005, the company repurchased 75.7 million shares of its common stock under an accelerated share repurchase agreement and paid $3.0 billion for the repurchase. Upon the conclusion of the agreement in 2006, the company paid $180 million in cash to Goldman, Sachs & Co. to settle the agreement. Additionally, in 2006, the company made open market purchases of its shares for $100 million. In 2007, the company purchased 34.7 million shares for $1.7 billion, thereby, completing this program. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of shares activity. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.7 billion at December 31, 2008, $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2006. The $2.3 billion increase from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to net increase in borrowings. The $457 million decrease from 2006 to 2007 is primarily due to the company’s share repurchase activity, as well as cash used to meet other business requirements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee Contracts Indemnifications In connection with acquisitions and divestitures, the company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures and related business activities prior to the 36 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued completion of the transaction. The term of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and product liabilities, is generally indefinite. In addition, the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, against liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the company, such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters. If the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $110 million and $101 million, respectively. Although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued, due to the nature of indemnified items, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist. In connection with the 2004 sale of the majority of the net assets of Textiles and Interiors, the company indemnified INVISTA against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal and environmental matters and other representations and warranties under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The estimated fair value of the indemnity obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement is $70 million and is included in the indemnifications balance of $110 million at December 31, 2008. Under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the company’s total indemnification obligation for the majority of the representations and warranties cannot exceed $1.4 billion. The other indemnities are not subject to this limit. In March 2008, INVISTA filed suit in the Southern District of New York alleging that certain representations and warranties in the Purchase and Sale Agreement were breached and, therefore, that DuPont is obligated to indemnify it. DuPont disagrees with the extent and value of INVISTA’s claims. DuPont has not changed its estimate of its total indemnification obligation under the Purchase and Sale Agreement as a result of the lawsuit. Obligations for Equity Affiliates and Others The company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates, customers, suppliers and other affiliated and unaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2008, the company had directly guaranteed $605 million of such obligations, plus $121 million relating to guarantees of obligations for divested subsidiaries. This represents the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees. The company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, a liability of $121 million and $135 million, respectively, was recorded for these obligations, representing the amount of payment/performance risk which the company deems probable. This liability is principally related to obligations of the company’s polyester films joint venture which are guaranteed by the company. Existing guarantees for customers, suppliers and other unaffiliated companies arose as part of contractual agreements. Existing guarantees for equity affiliates and other affiliated companies arose for liquidity needs in normal operations. In certain cases, the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers. The company has guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities of its divested subsidiaries including Conoco and Consolidation Coal Sales Company. Conoco and Consolidation Coal Sales Company have indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2008, the company had no significant liabilities recorded for these obligations. Additional information with respect to the company’s guarantees is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees. Master Operating Leases At December 31, 2008, the company has one master operating lease program relating to miscellaneous short-lived equipment with an unamortized value of approximately $106 million. Lease payments for these assets totaled $55 million in 2008, $59 million in 2007 and $58 million in 2006, and were reported as operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statements. The leases under this program are considered operating leases and accordingly 37 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued the related assets and liabilities are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Furthermore, the lease payments associated with this program vary based on one month USD LIBOR. In November 2008, the lessor notified the company that the program will terminate by November 2009. Prior to that time, the company may either purchase the assets for their unamortized value or arrange for the sale of the assets and remit the proceeds to the lessor. If the assets are sold and the proceeds are less than the unamortized value, the company must pay to the lessor the difference between the proceeds and the unamortized value, up to the residual value guarantee, which totaled $92 million at December 31, 2008. Contractual Obligations Information related to the company’s significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In Total at December 31, 2010 – 2012 – 2014 and (Dollars in millions) 2008 2009 2011 2013 beyond Long-term and short-term debt 1 $ 9,194 $ 1,563 $ 949 $ 2,158 $ 4,524 Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity 3,137 439 706 610 1,382 Capital leases 1 10 3 1 2 4 Operating leases 1,074 320 354 238 162 Purchase obligations 2 Information technology infrastructure & services 64 26 19 11 8 Raw material obligations 675 254 198 142 81 Utility obligations 476 142 102 75 157 INVISTA-related obligations 3 1,811 343 597 583 288 Human resource services 327 18 38 91 180 Other 4 20 19 - - 1 Total purchase obligations 3,373 802 954 902 715 Other liabilities 1,5 Workers’ compensation 77 17 33 13 14 Asset retirement obligations 60 9 15 3 33 Environmental remediation 379 90 124 85 80 Legal settlements 49 24 22 3 - License agreement 6 593 90 180 174 149 Other 7 119 24 18 14 63 Total other long-term liabilities 1,277 254 392 292 339 Total contractual obligations 8 $ 18,065 $ 3,381 $ 3,356 $ 4,202 $ 7,126 1 Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement. 3 Includes raw material supply obligations of $1.7 billion and contract manufacturing obligations of $67 million. 4 Primarily represents obligations associated with distribution, health care/benefit administration, research and development and other professional and consulting contracts. 5 Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have been excluded from the table as they are discussed below within Long-Term Employee Benefits. 6 Represents remaining expected payments under a license agreement between Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. and Monsanto Company. 7 Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other postretirement benefits. 8 Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the estimate of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. 38 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations should unforeseen circumstances arise. Long-Term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company’s earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability and life insurance protection for employees. Approximately 80 percent of the company’s worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company’s worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company’s non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits. Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees’ pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans’ actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. No contributions are required to be made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2009 and no contributions are currently anticipated. Contributions beyond 2009 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment, investment returns on pension trust assets, and pending regulation. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $252 million in 2008 and anticipates that it will make approximately $300 million in contributions in 2009 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “Act”) was signed into law in the U.S. in August 2006. The Act introduces new funding requirements for single-employer defined benefit pension plans, provides guidelines for measuring pension plan assets and pension obligations for funding purposes, introduces benefit limitations for certain underfunded plans and raises tax deduction limits for contributions to retirement plans. The new funding requirements are generally effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007. The implementation of the provisions of this Act did not have a material impact on the company’s required contributions. In August 2006, the company announced major changes to the pension and defined contribution benefits that cover the majority of its U.S. employees. Effective January 1, 2007, for such employees hired on that date or thereafter, and effective January 1, 2008, for such active employees on the rolls as of December 31, 2006, the company contributes 100 percent of the first 6 percent of the employee’s contribution election. Additionally, for such employees, the company contributes 3 percent of each eligible employee’s compensation regardless of the employee’s contribution election. The definition of eligible compensation has also been expanded to be similar to the definition of eligible compensation used in determining pension benefits. Such full service employees on the rolls as of December 31, 2006 will also accrue additional benefits in the pension plan, but the annual rate of pension accrual is about one-third of the previous rate. In addition, company-paid postretirement survivor benefits for such employees do not continue to grow after December 31, 2007. Such employees hired in the U.S. after December 31, 2006 do not participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans. 39 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued As a result of the amendment to the principal U.S. pension plan, the company was required to re-measure its pension expense for the remainder of 2006, reflecting plan assets and benefit obligations as of the re-measurement date. As a result of better than expected return on plan assets and a higher discount rate of 6 percent as of the re-measurement date, pre-tax pension expense decreased by $72 million for 2006. For 2007, the plan amendment resulted in a reduction in pension expense of about $40 million. For 2008, the plan amendment resulted in a reduction of about $40 million in combined pension and defined contribution plans expense. Additional information related to these changes in the plans noted above is included in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On December 31, 2006, the company adopted SFAS 158 and recorded a $1,555 million after-tax charge to stockholder’s equity primarily due to reclassifying unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs related to the pension plans. Medical, dental, life insurance and disability plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $326 million, $315 million and $335 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $330 million in 2009. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles. The company’s income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company’s income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges and credits related to long-term employee benefits. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Defined benefit plan (benefits)/charges $ (362 ) $ (54 ) $ 191 Defined contribution plan charges 250 1 99 86 Other long-term employee benefit charges 181 192 155 Net amount $ 69 $ 237 $ 432 1 Includes an accrual of $16 million for company match and contribution based on compensation paid in 2009 for 2008 service. The above (benefits)/charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The decrease in pension expense in 2008 primarily reflects favorable returns on pension assets during 2007. The decrease in pension expense in 2007 reflects favorable returns on pension assets during 2006, plan amendments and changes in demographics and discount rates. The increase in 2007 other long-term employee benefit charges principally reflects changes in demographics, discount rates and higher than expected health care costs. The company’s key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2009, lower pension assets and higher health care cost are expected to result in an increase in long-term employee benefits expense of about $565 million. Environmental Matters DuPont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, DuPont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, eliminate the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of waste water discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future. While these costs may increase in the future, they are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 40 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations totaled $628 million in 2008 compared with $576 million in 2007 and $521 million in 2006. These expenses include the remediation accruals discussed below; operating, maintenance and depreciation costs for solid waste, air and water pollution control facilities and the costs of environmental research activities. The company expects expenses related to environmental research activities to become proportionally greater as the company increases its participation in businesses for which environmental assessments are required during product development. About 75 percent of total annual environmental expenses resulted from operations in the U.S. In 2008, DuPont spent approximately $104 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $98 million in 2009. In the U.S., significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures. Total CAA capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from $40 million to $70 million. Registration The goal of the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is to prevent unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment associated with the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of chemical substances. Under TSCA, the EPA has established reporting, record-keeping, testing and control-related requirements for new and existing chemicals. In 1998, the EPA challenged the U.S. chemical industry to voluntarily conduct screening level health and environmental effects testing on nearly 3,000 High Production Volume (HPV) chemicals or to make equivalent information publicly available. An HPV chemical is a chemical listed on the 1990 Inventory Update Rule with annual U.S. cumulative production and imports of one million pounds or more. The company expects to complete its commitments regarding the HPV chemicals it volunteered to sponsor within the next two years. Approximately 500 chemicals in commerce have attained HPV status since 1990. The Extended HPV (EHPV) program is an expansion of the voluntary HPV program aimed at fulfilling the same goals on these 500 chemicals. DuPont committed to conduct testing on ten of these EHPV chemicals in 2008 and testing is underway and expected to be completed in the next two years. In December 2006, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals. This regulatory framework known as REACH entered into force on June 1, 2007. One of its main objectives is the protection of human health and the environment. REACH requires manufacturers and importers to gather information on the properties of their substances that meet certain volume or toxicological criteria and register the information in a central database to be maintained by a Chemical Agency in Finland. The Regulation also contains a mechanism for the progressive substitution of the most dangerous chemicals when suitable alternatives have been identified. DuPont met the deadline of December 1, 2008 for the pre-registration of those chemicals manufactured in, or imported into the European Economic Area in quantities of 1 metric ton or more that were not otherwise exempted. Complete registrations containing extensive data on the characteristics of the chemical will be required in three phases, depending on production usage or tonnage imported per year, and the toxicological criteria of the chemical. The first registrations are required in 2010; subsequent registrations are due in 2013 and 2018. The toxicological criteria considered for registration determinations are carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity (category 1 and 2), and aquatic toxicity. By June 1, 2013, the Commission will review whether substances with endocrine disruptive properties should be authorized if safer alternatives exist. By June 1, 2019, the Commission will determine whether to extend the duty to warn from substances of very high concern to those that could be dangerous or unpleasant. Management does not expect that the costs to comply with REACH will be material to its operations and consolidated financial position. Climate Change DuPont believes that climate change is an important global issue that will present numerous risks and opportunities to business and society at large. Since the early 1990s when DuPont began taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the company has achieved major global reductions in emissions. Voluntary emissions reductions implemented by DuPont and other companies are valuable but alone will not be sufficient to effectively address 41 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued a problem of this scale. The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in February 2005 and, while not ratified by the U.S., has spurred policy action by many other countries and regions around the world including the European Union. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of a post-2012 international policy framework to guide international action to address climate change when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect the company’s energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. However, the successful negotiation and implementation of sensible national, regional, and international climate change policies could provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. The company actively manages the potential risks that climate change could present, including those associated with the company’s physical assets, as well as regulatory and economic issues. DuPont looks for opportunities to make its overall portfolio less energy intensive, and energy use is one factor that is weighed when investments or divestitures are considered. DuPont is committed to continuing to bring to market more products and services to meet new and expanded demands of a low-carbon economy. Remediation Expenditures The RCRA extensively regulates and requires permits for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination at the facility. If conditions warrant, companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, the costs of the RCRA corrective action program are typically borne solely by the company. The company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required over the next two decades. Annual expenditures for the near term, however, are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. The company’s expenditures associated with RCRA and similar remediation activities were approximately $51 million, $47 million and $44 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. From time to time, the company receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a PRP under CERCLA or similar state statutes. CERCLA is often referred to as the Superfund and requires companies to undertake certain investigative and research activities at sites where it conducts or once conducted operations or where company generated waste has been disposed. The company has also, on occasion, been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company’s past operations. As of December 31, 2008, the company had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA or state laws at 394 sites around the U.S., with active remediation under way at 151 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at 160 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in “de minimis buyouts” with other PRPs whose waste, like the company’s, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at five new sites during 2008 compared with six similar notices in 2007 and 2006. The company’s expenditures associated with CERCLA and similar state remediation activities were approximately $17 million, $20 million and $19 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For nearly all Superfund sites, the company’s potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other PRPs is relatively low. Other PRPs at sites, where the company is a party, typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and, where they do not, or where PRPs cannot be located, the company’s own share of liability has not materially increased. There are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites and at all CERCLA sites in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. 42 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued Total expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws were $81 million, $68 million and $64 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Remediation Accruals At December 31, 2008, the Consolidated Balance Sheets included an accrued liability of $379 million compared to $357 million at December 31, 2007. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2008. Of the $379 million accrued liability, approximately 8 percent was reserved for non-U.S. facilities. Approximately 69 percent of the reserve balance was attributable to RCRA and similar remediation liabilities, while about 23 percent was attributable to CERCLA liabilities. Remediation accruals of $103 million, $76 million and $71 million were added to the reserve in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Facility Security DuPont recognizes that the security and safety of its operations are critical to its employees, neighbors and, indeed, to the future of the company. As such, the company has merged chemical site security into its safety core value where it serves as an integral part of its long standing safety culture. Physical security measures have been combined with process safety measures (including the use of inherently safer technology), administrative procedures and emergency response preparedness into an integrated security plan. The company has conducted vulnerability assessments at operating facilities in the U.S. and high priority sites worldwide and identified and implemented appropriate measures to protect these facilities from physical or cyber attacks. DuPont is partnering with carriers, including railroad, shipping and trucking companies, to secure chemicals in transit. In April 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an interim final rule (Rule) that establishes risk-based performance standards for the security of U.S. chemical facilities. Covered chemical facilities are required to prepare Security Vulnerability Assessments that identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement Site Security Plans that include measures satisfying the identified risk-based performance standards. The Rule contains associated provisions addressing inspections and audits, recordkeeping, and the protection of information that constitutes Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information. DHS can seek compliance through the issuance of Orders, including Orders Assessing Civil Penalty and Orders for the Cessation of Operations. In November of 2007, DHS finalized the list of chemicals regulated by the Rule and required facilities that have those chemicals in specified quantities to register with DHS. DuPont’s U.S. facilities have submitted this information and in June of 2008 DHS notified those facilities that were determined to be covered by the Rule’s security requirements. DuPont facilities that were notified by DHS conducted and submitted security vulnerability assessments to DHS. Once DHS has reviewed and approved those assessments, it will work with the company to establish security expectations specific to each facility. DuPont has already devoted substantial effort and resources in assessing security vulnerabilities and taking steps to reinforce security at its chemical manufacturing facilities. Until each facility develops and receives DHS approval for its site security plan, specific requirements can not be determined and considerable uncertainty exists regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, based on guidance issued by DHS regarding its risk-based performance standards, it is expected that new security measures will need to be implemented at the regulated facilities and that capital costs to implement such measures over the next three years will be about $50 million. PFOA DuPont manufactures fluoropolymer resins and dispersions as well as fluorotelomers, marketing many of them under the Teflon®, Capstone tm and Zonyl® brands. The fluoropolymer resins and dispersions businesses are part of the Electronic & Communication Technologies segment; the fluorotelomers business is part of the Safety & Protection segment. Fluoropolymer resins and dispersions are high-performance materials with many end uses including architectural fabrics, telecommunications and electronic wiring insulation, automotive fuel systems, computer chip processing 43 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued equipment, weather-resistant/breathable apparel and non-stick cookware. Fluorotelomers are used to make soil, stain and grease repellants for paper, apparel, upholstery and carpets as well as firefighting foams and coatings. A form of PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) is used as a processing agent to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. For over 50 years, DuPont purchased its PFOA needs from a third party, but beginning in the fall of 2002, it began producing PFOA to support the manufacture of fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. PFOA is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC (DPE) uses PFOA in the manufacture of raw materials to manufacture Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer parts. PFOA is also used in the manufacture of some fluoroelastomers marketed by DPE under the Viton® trademark. The wholly owned subsidiary is a part of the Performance Materials segment. PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. As a result, the EPA initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources of PFOA in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to PFOA is occurring. In 2005, the EPA issued a draft risk assessment on PFOA stating that cancer data for PFOA may be best described as “suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential” under the EPA’s Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. At the EPA’s request, the Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed and commented on the scientific soundness of this assessment. In its May 2006 report, the SAB set forth the view, based on laboratory studies in rats, that the human carcinogenic potential of PFOA is more consistent with the Guideline’s descriptor of “likely to be carcinogenic.” However, the report stated that additional data should be considered before the EPA finalizes its risk assessment of PFOA. The EPA has acknowledged that it will consider additional data, including new research and testing, and has indicated that another SAB review will be sought after the EPA makes its risk assessment. DuPont disputes the cancer classification recommended in the SAB report. Although the EPA has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks associated with PFOA, it also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any products because of concerns about PFOA. DuPont respects the EPA’s position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of PFOA and DuPont and other companies have outlined plans to continue research, emission reduction and product stewardship activities to help address the EPA’s questions. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to the EPA’s 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. In October 2008, (for the year 2007), DuPont reported to the EPA that it had achieved a 98 percent reduction of PFOA emissions in U.S. manufacturing facilities. The company achieved about a 97 percent reduction in global manufacturing emissions, exceeding the EPA’s 2010 objective. DuPont will work individually and with others in the industry to inform EPA’s regulatory counterparts in the European Union, Canada, China and Japan about these activities and PFOA in general, including emissions reductions from DuPont’s facilities, reformulation of the company’s fluoropolymer dispersions and new manufacturing processes for fluorotelomers products. In February 2007, DuPont announced its planned commitment to no longer make, use or buy PFOA by 2015 or sooner if possible. DuPont has developed PFOA replacement technology and successfully used this technology in its global manufacturing facilities to produce test materials for all major fluoropolymer product lines. DuPont has begun to supply fluoropolymer products made without PFOA to customers for testing in their processes, and is working to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals for this technology. In the meantime, DuPont introduced Echelontm technology which reduces PFOA content by 99 percent in aqueous fluoropolymer dispersion products. DuPont has now converted customers representing over 95 percent of the sales volume for these products to the newly formulated Echelontm technology. In the first quarter 2008, DuPont introduced its next generation fluorotelomer products. The products are marketed as DuPonttm Capstonetm products for use in home furnishings, fire fighting foam, fluorosurfactants, and leather goods. Additional products will be introduced for paper packaging, textiles, and other end use markets pending appropriate regulatory approvals. 44 Table of Contents Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, continued In November 2006, DuPont entered into an Order on Consent under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) with the EPA establishing a precautionary interim screening level for PFOA of 0.5 part per billion (ppb) in drinking water sources in the area around the Washington Works site located in Parkersburg, West Virginia. In January 2009 the EPA issued a Provisional Health Advisory for PFOA of 0.4 ppb in drinking water. In February 2007, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) identified a preliminary drinking-water guidance level for PFOA of 0.04 ppb as part of the first phase of an ongoing process to establish a state drinking-water standard. While the NJDEP will continue sampling and evaluation of data from all sources, it has not recommended a change in consumption patterns. Occupational exposure to PFOA has been associated with small increases in some lipids (e.g. cholesterol). These associations were also observed in a recent community study. It is not known whether these are causal associations. Based on health and toxicological studies, DuPont believes the weight of evidence indicates that PFOA exposure does not pose a health risk to the general public. To date, there are no human health effects known to be caused by PFOA, although study of the chemical continues. There have not been any regulatory or government actions that would prohibit the production or use of PFOA. However, there can be no assurance that the EPA, any other regulatory entity or government body will not choose to regulate or prohibit the production or use of PFOA in the future. Products currently manufactured by the company representing approximately $1 billion of 2008 revenues could be affected by any such regulation or prohibition. DuPont has established reserves in connection with certain PFOA environmental and litigation matters (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 45 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. Derivative instruments utilized include forwards, options, futures and swaps. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions and major commodity exchanges. The company hedges certain foreign currency denominated revenues, monetary assets and liabilities, certain business-specific foreign currency exposures and certain energy and agricultural feedstock purchases. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments, accounts receivable and derivatives. As part of the company’s risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The company’s sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. As of December 31, 2008, no one individual customer balance represented more than 5 percent of the company’s total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company’s global businesses. The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. Foreign Currency Risk The company’s objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes. Accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. Dollar value of its existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, commitments, and cash flows. The company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are minimized. The company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company’s exposure to certain foreign currency-denominated revenues so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. Dollar value of the related foreign currency-denominated revenues. The objective of the hedge program is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The following table summarizes the impacts of this program on the company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, and includes the company’s pro rata share of its equity affiliates’ exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk continued From time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements. Interest Rate Risk The company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed or floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on USD LIBOR. Interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. Commodity Price Risk The company enters into over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. A portion of certain energy feedstock purchases are hedged to reduce price volatility using fixed price swaps and options. The company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory. Under these contracts, growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the market price of grain during the contract period. Derivative instruments having a high correlation to the underlying commodity are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers. The company utilizes derivatives to manage the price volatility of soybean meal. These derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk. Additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sensitivity Analysis The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the market prices or rates that existed at December 31, 2008 and 2007. The sensitivity for interest rate swaps is based on a one percent change in the market interest rate. Foreign currency, agricultural and energy derivative sensitivities are based on a 10 percent change in market rates. Fair Value Fair Value Asset/ (Liability) Sensitivity (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2008 2007 Interest rate swaps $ 43 $ 19 $ (16 ) $ (26 ) Foreign currency contracts (348 ) 20 (581 ) (536 ) Agricultural feedstocks 1 31 (49 ) 5 Energy feedstocks (161 ) - (189 ) - The changes in 2008 sensitivity, as compared to 2007, are the result of an increase in price volatility and an increase in size of the foreign exchange and energy feedstock portfolios. Since the company’s risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure.",2023-12-30 21:52:11.957311
30554,CTA-PA,"EIDP, Inc.",2005,"Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview DuPont has seven segments. Five of the segments constitute the company's growth platforms: Agriculture & Nutrition, Coatings & Color Technologies, Electronic & Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, and Safety & Protection. The Pharmaceuticals segment includes income from the company's interest in two Angiotensin II Antagonist (AIIA) drugs, Cozaar® and Hyzaar®. The seventh segment is Textiles & Interiors. On April 30, 2004, DuPont sold the majority of the net assets of Textiles & Interiors, referred to as INVISTA, to Koch (see page 20 and Note 5 to the company's Consolidated Financial Statements). The sale of INVISTA was an important milestone in reducing the company's exposure to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and better positioning the company for long-term profitable growth. The company has set sustainable annual financial targets of 6 percent revenue growth, 10 percent earnings growth, and one percentage point improvement in Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). In 2004, earnings per share improved 84 percent, and ROIC increased by 3 percentage points. While consolidated Net sales increased 1 percent, Net sales of the five growth platforms increased $3.9 billion, more than offsetting a $3.8 billion reduction in Net sales following the sale of INVISTA. The company's 2004 performance reflected the strength of the five growth platforms and successful execution of the company's three key strategies: Putting Science to Work, Harnessing the Power of One DuPont, and Going Where the Growth Is. Putting Science to Work: Science helps form the capabilities, offerings and competitive advantages of all of the company's businesses. The company is not focused on a single blockbuster innovation, but seeks growth by generating dozens of new products with $20 million to $200 million in annual sales. Market-driven innovation, which relies on the voice of the customer and concrete market opportunities, has been central to the revitalization of the company's research efforts. The result is an increased percentage of sales from new products. The company has set a goal of deriving 35 percent of revenues from products less than five years old by 2007. Power of One DuPont: The company's strategy is to increase productivity and leverage market access, capabilities and customers, with a single entity focus, thereby creating wider opportunities for the numerous business units across the entire company. Productivity initiatives include revitalizing the company's research and development program, improving the effectiveness of its sales efforts, implementing various pricing initiatives, improving working capital efficiency, and pursuing a $900 million cost improvement program. In 2004, the company's strategic pricing initiative supported a 3 percent average increase in local-currency pricing for the growth platforms, and total company U.S. dollar (USD) pricing increased 5 percent, aided in part by currency impact of the weaker USD and a more favorable pricing environment in many global markets. Pricing momentum improved through 2004, with local prices more than offsetting the impact of higher raw material costs in the second half of the year. Through continued focus on its working capital efficiency, the company improved its days sales outstanding metric by 1 day and its inventory days supply metric by 8 days. Cost improvements, including substantial workforce reductions during 2004, procurement initiatives, and targeted spending reductions, have all contributed to a 2 percentage point reduction in Cost of goods sold and other operating charges as a percentage of Net sales. Going Where the Growth Is: The company seeks significant growth opportunities by increasing its presence in emerging markets and extending the company's science, products, brands and market position into new applications and uses, thereby creating new addressable market spaces. The company has a strong presence in most of the fastest- growing emerging markets and continues to leverage its presence and market position to realize new growth. In the five growth platforms, segment sales in China (PRC), Taiwan and Hong Kong, grew 32 percent collectively, while segment sales in Eastern Europe, including Turkey and the countries of the former Soviet Union, grew 35 percent. Another opportunity for growth is in expanding 15 the company's addressable markets. One example is Tyvek® nonwoven sheet structures, the longstanding leader in house wrap. It is now also being used for roofing systems and window seal applications in an expanding building innovations market. Other examples include Kevlar® and Nomex® aramids, which are finding new and varied applications in the personal protection market. Financial Discipline: The company seeks to execute these strategies in a financially prudent manner and plans to continue its cash discipline policy. The current policy is first, to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. The company's cash discipline policy and strong liquidity profile are important to its long-term growth. Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable debt securities balances of $3.5 billion and bank credit lines of $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2004, provide primary liquidity to support all short-term obligations. Secondary liquidity, sufficient to meet upcoming debt maturities, comes from excellent access to capital markets, strong cash flow generation and the ability to sell assets. Analysis of Operations (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 NET SALES $ 27,340 $ 26,996 $ 24,006 2004 vs. 2003 Consolidated net sales for 2004 were $27.3 billion, up one percent. Portfolio changes, principally the sale of INVISTA partly offset by the consolidation of DDE as a variable interest entity (VIE) and the benefit of small acquisitions, resulted in a $2.6 billion or 10 percent reduction in Net sales. The combination of higher sales volumes and USD selling prices increased sales 11 percent. 16 Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Continued The tables below show a regional breakdown of 2004 and 2003 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year: Percent Change Due to: 2004 Net Sales Percent Change vs. 2003 (Dollars in billions) Local Price Currency Effect Volume Other* Worldwide $ 27.3 1 2 3 6 (10 ) United States 11.6 (4 ) 3 0 4 (11 ) Europe 8.0 8 1 10 4 (7 ) Asia Pacific 4.7 4 1 3 14 (14 ) Canada & Latin America 3.0 4 1 2 8 (7 ) *Includes the reduction in sales following the sale of INVISTA, and additions to sales resulting from small acquisitions and the consolidation of DDE. In 2004, the company saw strength in its major markets including motor vehicle production and related after-markets, production agriculture and construction. Growth in these key markets, particularly in Asia Pacific, as well as increased market share, contributed to a 6 percent increase in worldwide sales volumes, which helped offset a $3.8 billion reduction in sales following the sale of INVISTA. 2003 vs. 2002 Consolidated net sales for 2003 increased $3 billion or 12 percent, reflecting 5 percent higher volume, 4 percent higher U.S. dollar selling prices, and 3 percent resulting from acquisitions, principally the formation of The Solae Company and the purchase of the remaining interest in Griffin LLC in 2003, as well as the purchase of ChemFirst, Inc. and Liqui-Box Corporation which occurred during 2002. Percent Change Due to: 2003 Net Sales (Dollars in billions) Percent Change vs. 2002 Local Price Currency Effect Volume Other* Worldwide $ 27.0 12 (1 ) 5 5 3 United States 12.1 6 0 0 2 4 Europe 7.4 18 (2 ) 16 2 2 Asia Pacific 4.6 18 (1 ) 3 16 0 Canada & Latin America 2.9 20 2 2 6 10 *Includes impacts from the sale of the Clysar® business, acquisitions of Liqui-Box and ChemFirst, Inc., purchases of the remaining interests in Griffin LLC and Renpar S.A., and the formation of The Solae Company. Higher worldwide USD selling prices, primarily reflecting the beneficial currency impact of the weaker dollar, increased worldwide sales by 4 percent. Volume growth was largely attributable to double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, reflecting increased sales of electronics-related materials and polymers, agricultural products, and engineering polymers. 17 (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 OTHER INCOME $ 655 $ 734 $ 516 2004 vs. 2003 Other income decreased $79 million in 2004. This reduction is primarily due to a $257 million increase in net exchange losses (see page 46 for a discussion of the company's program to manage foreign currency risk and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and a loss of $49 million for equity affiliates as a result of the $150 million charge to provide for the company's share of anticipated losses associated with DDE litigation (discussed in detail in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). These losses were largely offset by a $118 million increase in interest income, $50 million of which was attributable to the reversal of accrued interest related to certain prior year tax contingencies, and a $102 million increase in income associated with Cozaar®/Hyzaar® antihypertensive drugs. 2003 vs. 2002 Other income increased $218 million in 2003. This improvement is primarily attributable to $160 million in lower exchange losses (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and a $104 million increase in income associated with Cozaar®/Hyzaar® antihypertensive drugs (including a $23 million benefit from favorable arbitration). Other income also benefited from a $16 million favorable settlement related to the Unifi manufacturing alliance. These increases were partly offset by lower earnings in equity affiliates and lower interest income. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES $20,416 $20,759 $17,529 As a percent of Net sales 75% 77% 73% 2004 vs. 2003 Cost of goods sold and other operating charges (COGS) declined $343 million. As a percent of Net sales, COGS was down 2 percentage points. The decrease relative to sales reflects a significant benefit from portfolio changes, principally the sale of INVISTA, which had higher COGS in relation to sales than the rest of the company. COGS as a percent of sales also improved due to higher local selling prices and increased sales volumes with higher gross margins due to improved operating rates, lower plant operating costs, and higher manufacturing yields. The currency impact from the weaker USD also had a positive impact as its benefit to sales exceeded its concurrent increase in COGS. The positive factors discussed above were partly offset by increased litigation charges (see Note 25) and significantly higher raw material costs. 2003 vs. 2002 Cost of goods sold and other operating charges increased $3.2 billion. As a percent of Net sales, COGS was up 4 percentage points. This increase relative to sales reflects a $1.0 billion increase in raw material costs, principally those related to oil and natural gas, as well as a $400 million increase in pension and stock option expenses. 2003 also included net charges of $78 million related to Benlate® litigation. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $3,141 $3,067 $2,763 As a percent of Net sales 11% 11% 12% 2004 vs. 2003 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $74 million or 2 percent. The increase principally reflects higher spending for strategic growth initiatives, particularly in Agriculture & Nutrition, the impact of currency translation, and the impact of consolidating DDE. These increases were partly offset by cost reduction programs and the sale of INVISTA. 2003 vs. 2002 Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2003 increased $304 million over 2002. This increase reflects higher non-cash pension expenses, the impact of currency translation and the net impact of portfolio changes. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE $1,333 $1,349 $1,264 As a percent of Net sales 5% 5% 5% 2004 vs. 2003 Research and development expense in 2004 remained stable as a percentage of Net sales. 2004 spending reflects increases across most segments offset by the absence of spending in Textiles & Interiors after April 30, 2004. 18 2003 vs. 2002 The increase in Research and development expense in 2003 is primarily attributable to higher non-cash pension expenses. The company continues to support a strong commitment to research and development as a source of sustainable growth, and expects research and development funding to remain at about the same level in 2005. Because of its broad array of businesses and research projects, the company's future financial performance is not materially dependent on the success or failure of any single research or development project. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 INTEREST EXPENSE $362 $347 $359 2004 vs. 2003 2004 Interest expense was $15 million higher than 2003. This increase reflects the impact of higher average debt levels, partly offset by lower average interest rates. 2003 vs. 2002 Interest expense was $12 million lower than 2002. The decrease reflects lower average interest rates, partly offset by higher debt levels. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES (CREDITS) $411 $(17) $290 2004 Activities The company initiated aggressive actions in 2004 to ensure its global competitiveness as a more focused, science-based company. The company recorded a net charge of $411 million related to employee separation costs and asset impairment charges. This includes $312 million to provide severance benefits for approximately 2,700 employees involved in manufacturing, marketing and sales, administrative and technical activities. These staff reductions affected essentially all segments. Approximately 2,400 employees were separated as of December 31, 2004. The company also recorded a benefit of $22 million in 2004 resulting from changes in estimates for current and prior years' restructuring programs. In addition, the company recorded impairment charges of $121 million in 2004 which included: $27 million to reflect an other than temporary decline in the value of an investment security; $23 million related to the shutdown of U.S. manufacturing assets; $42 million related to the write down of certain European manufacturing assets; and $29 million to write off abandoned technology. Additional details related to these employee separation costs and asset impairment charges are contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the aggregate, payments from operating cash flows to terminated employees are expected to total about $302 million. Over 40 percent of these cash outlays were made in 2004, over 50 percent are expected to be paid in 2005, and the remainder thereafter. As a result of these activities, the company expects annual pretax cost savings of about $225 million per year of which about 40 percent were realized in 2004 and essentially all the remaining savings are expected to be realized in 2005. Over 50 percent of these savings will result in reduced Selling, general and administrative expenses, over 30 percent in reduced Cost of goods sold and other operating charges, and the balance in reduced Research and development expense. The impact of these workforce reductions represents a key component of the company's previously announced $900 million cost improvement program. 2002 Programs Restructuring programs instituted in 2002 further aligned resources consistent with the specific missions of the segments, thereby improving competitiveness, accelerating progress toward sustainable growth and addressing weakening economic conditions. These programs are discussed below. Additional details are contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2002 Coatings & Color Technologies A restructuring program was instituted within Coatings & Color Technologies in the fourth quarter 2002. Under the program, costs to terminate approximately 775 employees involved in technical, manufacturing, marketing and administrative activities reduced 2002 Income before income taxes and minority interests by $69 million. Essentially all employees had been terminated as of December 31, 2003 thereby completing this portion of the program. In addition, the company shut down operating facilities during 2003 due to transferring production to more cost effective facilities. 19 In the aggregate, payments from operating cash flows to terminated employees and to third parties, principally for dismantlement and removal activities, are expected to total about $75 million. Over 50 percent of these cash outlays were made in 2003, 30 percent in 2004, and the remaining payments will be made over the next several years. As a result of these activities, the company realized annual pretax cost savings of about $55 million per year, with about 60 percent realized in 2003 and essentially all of the remaining savings realized in 2004. About 70 percent of these savings resulted in reduced Cost of goods sold and other operating charges, with the remaining 30 percent divided about evenly between Selling, general and administrative expenses and Research and development expense. 2002 Textiles & Interiors A restructuring program was instituted within Textiles & Interiors in the second quarter 2002. Under the program, the cost to terminate approximately 2,000 employees involved in technical, manufacturing, marketing and administrative activities and to shut down operating facilities, principally due to transferring production to more cost effective facilities, reduced 2002 Income before taxes and minority interest by $208 million. Essentially all employees had been terminated as of December 31, 2003, thereby completing this portion of the program. In the aggregate, payments from operating cash flows to terminated employees and third parties for dismantlement and removal activities are expected to total about $154 million. About 30 percent of the cash outlays were made in 2002, 40 percent in 2003, 10 percent in 2004, and the remainder will be made over the next several years. The company realized annual pretax cost savings of about $120 million per year from this restructuring program. About 20 percent of these savings were realized in 2002, and essentially all of the remaining savings were realized in 2003. About 80 percent of these savings resulted in reduced Cost of goods sold and other operating charges, with the remaining 20 percent divided evenly between Selling, general and administrative expenses and Research and development expense. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 SEPARATION CHARGES– TEXTILES & INTERIORS $667 $1,620 – On April 30, 2004, the company completed the sale of INVISTA to Koch for $3,844 million, except for the transfer of the company's interest in certain equity affiliates. The transfer of these affiliates will be delayed until the company receives approval from its equity partners. Upon the transfer of these equity affiliates, DuPont expects to realize a gain of approximately $77 million, subject to adjustments related to the timing of the transfer. If the company's interest in these equity affiliates were not to be transferred, final cash proceeds would be reduced by $168 million, of which DuPont received $138 million as an advance payment at closing on April 30, 2004. In 2004, the company recorded a charge of $667 million as a result of the INVISTA sale and other Textiles & Interiors separation activities. The INVISTA related portion of this charge was $626 million and included the following: a reduction of the original sales price of $240 million, a charge of $77 million related to the delayed transfer of certain equity affiliates (discussed above), $118 million related to changes in the book value of net assets sold, $37 million related to final settlement of working capital balances and other separation charges of $154 million which consisted primarily of incremental legal, accounting and other advisory fees, other employee related separation costs, and the early termination of a long-term supply contract. Additional charges and credits could occur when the company finalizes its 2004 tax returns. The company also has plans underway to sell the remaining assets of Textiles & Interiors not purchased by Koch. As part of the company's plans to sell these assets, the company recorded a $41 million impairment charge to write down its investment in an equity affiliate to fair market value. The company completed the sale of this investment in an affiliate on November 30, 2004 for $108 million which included $68 million in cash proceeds and a $40 million receivable secured by a bank letter of credit. The impact of separating the remaining Textiles & Interiors businesses is not expected to be significant to the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 20 Part II The following table summarizes 2004 cash proceeds related to the sale of Textiles & Interiors assets: (Dollars in millions) Sale of INVISTA (April 30, 2004) $ 3,844 Cash retained by INVISTA businesses sold (75 ) Settlement of INVISTA working capital and pensions 3 Sale of investment in equity affiliate (November 30, 2004) 68 Total $ 3,840 In 2003, the company recorded a charge of $1,620 million related to the planned separation of Textiles & Interiors. The company wrote down the assets to be sold to estimated fair value and recorded separation charges as follows: Property, plant and equipment of $1,168 million, intangible assets of $57 million (excluding goodwill, see Note 6), equity affiliates of $293 million, a pension curtailment loss of $78 million, and other separation charges of $24 million. The write-downs were based on estimated fair values as determined through a combination of negotiations to sell the assets and cash flow projections. At September 30, 2003 the company reclassified to assets held for sale the INVISTA related assets. Upon reclassification the company ceased depreciation and amortization of these assets which improved earnings per share by approximately $0.10 in 2004 and $0.07 in 2003. The company will have significant continuing involvement with INVISTA as a result of long-term purchase and supply contracts. In addition, the company has entered into a long-term contract manufacturing agreement in which INVISTA will manufacture and supply certain products for the company. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT– TEXTILES & INTERIORS – $ 295 – In 2003, in connection with the pending sale of INVISTA, the company was required to test the related goodwill for recoverability. This test indicated that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded fair value, and accordingly, the company recorded an impairment charge of $295 million to write off all of the goodwill associated with INVISTA. This write-off was based on an estimate of fair value as determined by the negotiated sales price of the INVISTA net assets. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 NONOPERATING GAIN – $ 62 – In 2003, the company recognized a $62 million gain associated with the formation of a majority-owned venture, The Solae Company, with Bunge Limited. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 GAIN ON SALE OF DUPONT PHARMACEUTICALS – – $ 25 In 2002, DuPont recognized a $25 million gain related to the 2001 sale of substantially all the net assets of DuPont Pharmaceuticals to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. DuPont retains its interest in the collaboration relating to Cozaar®/Hyzaar® antihypertensive drugs. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 (BENEFIT FROM) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES $(329 ) $(930 ) $ 185 Effective income tax rate (22.8 )% (650.3 )% 8.7 % In 2004, the company recorded significant tax benefits which principally included $360 million on exchange losses in connection with the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations, $320 million related to the separation of Textiles & Interiors, $160 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year audit issues previously reserved, and $137 million resulting from recording deferred tax assets in two European subsidiaries for tax basis investment losses recognized on local tax returns. These tax benefits were partly offset by net tax expense on other operating results. In 2003, the company also recorded significant tax benefits which principally included $669 million related to recording deferred tax assets in two European subsidiaries for tax basis investment losses recognized on local tax returns, $544 million 21 related to the separation of Textiles & Interiors, and $187 million on exchange losses in connection with the company's foreign currency hedging program. These tax benefits were partly offset by net tax expense on other operating results. The tax provision in 2002 reflects net tax expense on operating results, including a tax benefit of $235 million on exchange losses in connection with the company's foreign currency hedging program. For additional information with respect to the company's effective income tax rates for 2004, 2003 and 2002, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The company's current estimate of the 2005 effective income tax rate is about 27 percent, excluding any tax effects of exchange gains and losses or special items, neither of which can be reasonably estimated at this time. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 MINORITY INTERESTS IN (LOSSES) EARNINGS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES $ (9 ) $ 71 $ 98 Minority interests in losses of consolidated subsidiaries in 2004 reflect the consolidation of DDE as a VIE. Prior years include expenses associated with corporate minority interest structures which were redeemed in 2003. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES – $ (29 ) $ (2,944 ) On January 1, 2003, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, ""Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,"" which requires companies to record an asset and related liability for the costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived tangible asset if a legal liability to retire the asset exists. The adoption of this standard resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle after-tax charge to income of $29 million. The company's adoption of SFAS No. 142, ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"" resulted in a cumulative effect after-tax charge to income of $2,944 million, effective January 1, 2002. This charge was attributable to goodwill impairments of $2,866 million in Agriculture & Nutrition and $78 million in Textiles & Interiors. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 NET INCOME (LOSS) $ 1,780 $ 973 $ (1,103 ) 2004 vs. 2003 Net income for 2004 was $1,780 million compared to $973 million for 2003. Higher Net income reflects higher sales volumes, higher local currency prices and currency benefit from the weaker USD. In addition, cost improvement efforts made as part of the company's $900 million cost reduction program helped to offset general inflation in operating costs and higher planned spending for growth initiatives. Net income increased despite significantly higher raw material costs. Higher hydrocarbon prices, the single largest component of the company's raw material cost increase, escalated to historical highs during the year, driving up total variable costs by about $400 million, after-tax. Net after-tax charges for special items were $613 million, compared to net after-tax charges of $667 million in 2003. See the table appearing on page 23 for additional details. 2003 vs. 2002 Net income for the year 2003 was $973 million versus a net loss of $1,103 million in 2002. Income before the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was $1,002 million in 2003 versus $1,841 million in 2002, a decrease of $839 million or 46 percent. In 2003, special items totaled a net after-tax charge of $667 million, representing an increase of $499 million versus 2002, principally the result of 2003 charges taken in connection with the sale of INVISTA. In addition to the impact of increased special items, the reduction in 2003 Income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles versus 2002 reflects a $650 million after-tax increase in raw material costs and a $400 million after-tax increase in pension, other postretirement benefits, and stock option expenses. The remaining operating variances totaled a benefit of about $700 million, principally the result of higher sales volumes, other income, and more favorable currency translation and income tax rates. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.77 in 2004, $0.96 in 2003 and a loss of $1.11 in 2002. 22 Special Items (Dollars in millions, except per share) Pretax Benefit (Charge) 1 After-Tax (Charge) Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share 2004 Employee separation costs and asset impairment charges $ (411 ) $ (302 ) $ (0.29 ) DDE litigation (268 ) (231 ) (0.23 ) Textiles & Interiors related items 2 (667 ) (210 ) (0.22 ) PFOA class action litigation (108 ) (70 ) (0.07 ) Automotive refinish litigation (36 ) (23 ) (0.02 ) Benlate® litigation 20 13 0.01 Tax items 50 210 0.21 Total $ (1,420 ) $ (613 ) $ (0.61 ) 2003 Textiles & Interiors related items 2 $ (1,899 ) $ (686 ) $ (0.68 ) Benlate® litigation (78 ) (50 ) (0.05 ) Corporate minority interest redemption – (17 ) (0.02 ) Employee separation costs and asset impairment charges 17 12 0.01 Pharmaceuticals – favorable arbitration ruling 23 15 0.01 Gain on Canadian currency contract 30 18 0.02 Agriculture & Nutrition – The Solae Company nonoperating gain 62 41 0.04 Total $ (1,845 ) $ (667 ) $ (0.67 ) 2002 Employee separation costs and asset impairment charges $ (290 ) $ (200 ) $ (0.19 ) Litigation costs (130 ) (81 ) (0.08 ) Exchange loss (Argentina mandatory conversion) (63 ) (63 ) (0.06 ) Product exit costs (47 ) (29 ) (0.03 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt (21 ) (17 ) (0.02 ) Tax items – net – 65 0.06 Pioneer acquisition-related costs 40 67 0.07 Gain on asset sales 109 90 0.09 Total $ (402 ) $ (168 ) $ (0.16 ) 1The segment impact of these special items is included in Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2Includes deferred tax benefits related to two European subsidiaries of $137, or $0.13 per share in 2004, and $669, or $0.67 per share in 2003. 23 Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), ""Share-Based Payment"" (""SFAS 123R""), which replaced SFAS No. 123, ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."" DuPont voluntarily adopted the SFAS 123 fair value based method of accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees in 2003. SFAS 123R amends some aspects of the fair value measurement of the equity instruments granted to employees. This statement becomes effective for the company beginning in the third quarter of 2005. The company is assessing the provisions of the amendment, and does not currently expect its adoption in 2005 to materially impact its financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Critical Accounting Estimates The company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, postretirement employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring reserves, environmental matters, and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS In connection with the company's postretirement benefit plans, the fair value of assets in all pension plans was $18 billion at December 31, 2004, and the related benefit obligations were $22 billion. In addition, obligations under the company's unfunded other postretirement benefit plans were $5 billion at December 31, 2004. Expected return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions are particularly important when determining the company's benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs associated with postretirement benefits. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pretax earnings due to changes in these assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2004: (Dollars in millions) 1/2 Percentage Point Increase 1/2 Percentage Point Decrease Discount rate $ 84 $ (89 ) Expected rate of return on plan pension assets 80 (80 ) Additional information with respect to pension and other postretirement employee expenses and liabilities is discussed under Long-Term Employee Benefits beginning on page 42. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at multiparty sites, and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. The company has recorded a liability of $359 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. 24 Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued. Much of this liability results from the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, often referred to as the Superfund), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and similar state laws. These laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. Federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations, and could, among other things, impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company-generated waste disposal. Over the next two decades, the company may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of PRPs. Therefore, it is difficult to develop accurate estimates of future site remediation costs. A detailed discussion of environmental matters is contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis, beginning on page 43. LEGAL CONTINGENCIES The company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement claims and antitrust claims. The company records reserves for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these reserves to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits, and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation reserve when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INCOME TAXES The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the ultimate taxes the company will pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets would result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the net deferred tax asset. In some situations these changes could be material. 25 In 2004 and 2003, DuPont recorded $137 million and $669 million, respectively, in deferred tax assets associated with two European subsidiaries for their tax basis investment losses recognized on local tax returns. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. VALUATION OF ASSETS Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other purchased intangible assets, and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of long-lived assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on both the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. Future changes in the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges. Information with respect to the company's significant accounting policies on long-lived assets is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Outlook DuPont expects 2005 earnings per share to be between $2.65 and $2.85. Continued success in executing the company's growth strategies, productivity initiatives, and its cash discipline principles is expected to improve earnings per share and cash flow versus 2004. The company's agriculture businesses are highly seasonal. About two-thirds of the company's annual revenues have historically been realized in the first half of the calendar year. As a result, the company expects that approximately 70 percent of 2005 earnings per share will be realized within the first half of the year. Based on historic patterns of seasonality, first half earnings per share are expected to be about evenly split between the first and second quarters. Key expectations underlying this outlook are: Global economy: •Worldwide industrial economic growth is expected to be close to its 10-year historical trend line rate of 3 percent, with stronger growth in Eastern Europe, China and Latin America, and growth slightly below this trend in North America, Western Europe, and Japan. •Raw material costs are expected to increase above 2004, as oil and U.S. natural gas prices persist at current levels. Revenue growth: •Revenues from new products are expected to increase to 33 percent of total revenue as the company continues to introduce new products and realizes the full advantage of hundreds of new products introduced in the previous four years. •The pricing momentum created in 2004 is expected to continue. •Emerging market growth is expected to continue to outpace global GDP growth of about 3 percent, as the company increases its penetration into those markets. Productivity improvements: •The application of Six Sigma methodologies to global sourcing, energy reduction, yield improvements, increases in manufacturing uptime and other supply chain efficiencies will intensify in 2005. •The company expects to improve operating margins by realizing the full-year savings from the 2004 cost improvement program, coupled with increases in plant operating rates, sales and marketing effectiveness, and improved pricing. 26 Part II Segment Reviews Segment sales include transfers and a pro rata share of equity affiliate sales. Segment pretax operating income (PTOI) is defined as operating income before income taxes, minority interests, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses, interest, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated Net sales and segment PTOI to Income before income taxes and minority interests for 2004, 2003 and 2002 is included in Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2004 $ 6.2 $ 766 2003 5.5 669 2002 4.5 462 Agriculture & Nutrition leverages DuPont technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply. Global land area that can be used in agricultural production is increasingly limited. Therefore, increases in production will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted acreage. Agriculture & Nutrition delivers a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. The segment operates across the food value chain from inputs for production agriculture to global production and distribution of soy-based food ingredients, food quality diagnostic testing equipment and services, and liquid food packaging systems. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and enhance the value of grains and soy through improved seed traits, superior germplasm, and the effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Agriculture & Nutrition includes the company's wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. (Pioneer). Pioneer is the world's largest seed producer and the world leader in improving crop yields with hybrid and varietal seeds that improve grower yields and provide insect protection and herbicide tolerance. The principal products of Pioneer are hybrid seed corn and soybean seed. Pioneer benefited in 2004 from the successful launch of its largest technology offering in its history with 18 new soybean varieties and 74 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids that include new options for corn borer control, corn rootworm control and weed management. While the commercial seed industry for major crops remained stable in 2004, sales for Pioneer grew 15 percent. Sales growth was driven by increased market share in key segments of the corn and soybean markets, as well as strong product performance and price increases in most markets. Herbicide and insect resistant traits, along with high yielding genetics, also supported 2004 sales. The purchase of Verdia during the third quarter of 2004 will provide Pioneer the opportunity to improve its trait discovery capabilities through the use of gene shuffling technology. Agriculture & Nutrition also serves the global production agriculture industry with crop protection products in the grain and specialty crop sectors, forestry, and vegetation management. Principal crop protection products are herbicides, fungicides, insect control products and plant growth regulators. Sales of crop protection products increased 10 percent, with the most significant market share growth in insecticides, specifically in specialty crops in Asia Pacific. The segment strengthened its global position in products for cotton due to its broad array of offerings. The November 2003 acquisition of the remaining 50 percent ownership interest in Griffin LLC strengthened the segment's product sales and manufacturing resources to better serve customers. The segment also expanded its presence in fruit and vegetable specialty markets and entered the professional pest control market with the launch of several new product offerings. Agriculture & Nutrition also serves the specialty food ingredients market, including soy proteins and lecithins through its majority-owned venture with Bunge Limited, The Solae Company. In addition, the segment offers systems for the aseptic packaging of beverages, dairy products and 27 pumpable foods in retail and institutional applications. Sales of specialty foods grew 25 percent in 2004, of which 14 percent resulted from the formation of The Solae Company in 2003. Soy crush sales growth was driven by higher commodity prices. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $6.2 billion increased 14 percent reflecting 7 percent higher USD selling prices, 4 percent higher volumes, and a 3 percent benefit resulting from the formation of The Solae Company and the acquisition of the remaining interest in Griffin LLC. Higher selling prices were driven by a richer mix in corn and soybean seed, reflecting the success of the 2004 technology offering. Volume growth was driven by higher corn sales throughout all regions as well as increased soybean sales in the Northern Hemisphere, higher sales of insecticides in Asia Pacific and higher worldwide sales of soy-based products. 2004 PTOI was $766 million versus $669 million in 2003, up 14 percent. The improvement in 2004 PTOI reflects higher USD selling prices and higher sales volumes, partly offset by higher raw material costs. 2004 results also included restructuring charges of $34 million, whereas 2003 included a benefit of $64 million, principally related to the formation of The Solae Company. 2003 versus 2002 Sales of $5.5 billion were 21 percent higher as both USD selling prices and volumes increased 6 percent. The 21 percent increase also includes 9 percent due to additional sales resulting from the formation of The Solae Company and the acquisition of the remaining interest of Griffin LLC. Higher USD selling prices resulted principally from currency translation, reflecting the weaker dollar. Volume growth principally reflects increased corn seed sales in markets outside of North America, higher sales of herbicides in North America, a significant increase in insecticide sales in Asia Pacific, and higher worldwide sales of soy-based products. 2003 PTOI was $669 million, including a benefit of $64 million principally attributable to the formation of The Solae Company. This compares to PTOI of $462 million in 2002, which included a benefit of $40 million related to revisions in post-employment costs for Pioneer, a $37 million charge to reflect an expected loss on the sale of a manufacturing facility in Europe, and a $47 million charge to write off inventories of discontinued herbicide products. The improvement in 2003 PTOI also reflected the benefits of higher volumes and favorable currency exchange rates, which were partly offset by higher non-cash pension expense and raw material costs. Outlook The value of world commodity agricultural production (excluding horticulture and forestry) was at record levels in 2004 except in the Middle East, Africa, and the former Soviet Union. The 2005 global level is forecast to decline 6 percent from the 2004 high. Despite this forecast, 2005 is expected to exceed the 1995-2004 average by 14 percent and still suggests a relatively positive environment. The economic outlook for North American production agriculture (the largest market for the segment) is positive for 2005 despite lower commodity grain prices. Farm income is up primarily due to higher production resulting from higher yields. Demand from the livestock and industrial sectors in 2005 is expected to increase for commodity grains and oilseeds. North American production agriculture is expected to remain stable as net farm income reached record levels in 2004, grain storage is at historically low levels, and the growers' debt-to-equity and debt-to-asset ratios will be at their lowest levels since the early 1960s. Because of the positive economic environment, crop production in the U.S. and Canada is expected to continue at historically high levels. Due to these market factors and a number of company specific actions, the segment expects double-digit growth again in 2005. Pioneer expects to increase profitability through corn value offerings and seed treatments in North America, and through volume gains in international markets. Profitability is also expected to be driven by a continued market share gain in the North American soybean market. The segment's introduction of new crop protection products is projected to drive both volume and price gains. Technology will continue to play an important role for Agriculture & Nutrition. Pioneer will build on the unprecedented technology launch that benefited the North American 2004 planting season by offering 21 new soybean varieties and 40 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids. The segment will also undertake its largest crop protection product launch in 15 years including sulfonylurea blends 28 Affinity™ and Absolute™; flusilazole for Asian soybean rust; Advion™ and Avaunt® insecticides for professional pest control; and Talendo™ and Talius™ fungicides for grapes. In addition, the segment will continue to develop new mainstream products utilizing Solae® soy protein and seek to generate new opportunities, including low linolenic oil. Planned 2005 product introductions with Solae® soy protein include soy products with improved flavor, 8th Continent™* smoothies and low cost emulsified meat products. *8th Continent™ is a trademark of General Mills, Inc. COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2004 $ 6.0 $ 718 2003 5.5 735 2002 5.0 760 Coatings & Color Technologies is the world's leading automotive coatings supplier and the world's largest manufacturer of titanium dioxide white pigments. Products offered include high performance liquid and powder coatings for automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEM), the automotive aftermarket (known as refinish), and general industrial applications, which include coatings for plastics, bridges, windmills, pipes and appliances. The company markets its refinish products using the DuPont™, Standox®, Spies Hecker®, and Nason® brand names. Standox® and Spies Hecker® are focused on the high-end refinish markets, while Nason® is primarily focused on economy coating applications. In addition, a broad line of DuPont™ Ti-Pure® titanium dioxide products in both slurry and powder form serve the coatings, plastic, and paper industries. The segment also offers specialty products for ink jet digital printing including pigment and dye based inks and the DuPont™ Artistri™ printing systems for textiles. Specialty products include adhesive bonding and electrical insulation. The key markets in which Coatings & Color Technologies operates showed slight growth over 2003, with more significant growth in South America, Asia Pacific, and Europe. Industry demand for titanium dioxide white pigment was strong globally in 2004, particularly in the second half, with the industry operating at close to capacity. Demand grew in all regions, although growth in Asia Pacific, particularly China, moderated in the second half of the year as the result of actions by the Chinese government to tighten credit. The segment ended 2004 with record shipments of titanium dioxide through increased marketing efforts and supply chain improvements despite 4 percent higher USD selling prices. The OEM market realized growth in South America and Asia Pacific and was essentially flat in North America. North American light vehicle builds, which include automobiles and light trucks, were up 1 percent, while European builds were down about 2 percent. Although the collision market is declining, the segment's worldwide refinish volumes were flat with 2003, indicating share gain in the developed markets. Worldwide sales in the specialty coatings, electrical insulation and metal coatings markets showed improvement, while adhesives remained flat, and demand for protective and plastic coatings remained depressed. Powder coatings demand in Europe continued to be depressed, while demand in the Americas showed some improvement. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $6.0 billion increased 10 percent, principally reflecting a 5 percent benefit from the weaker dollar, 3 percent higher sales volumes, and 2 percent higher local prices. The increase in volumes is primarily related to titanium dioxide as capacity utilization for global titanium dioxide producers grew throughout the year, with all major producers essentially sold out beginning late in third quarter 2004. OEM coatings volume growth moderated in the second half as major auto producers, particularly in the U.S., announced production cutbacks to reduce new car inventories. PTOI was $718 million in 2004, down slightly from $735 million in 2003. Higher sales volumes and local selling price increases essentially offset net charges totaling $60 million for employee separation costs and $36 million related to the automotive refinishes litigation settlement (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Higher raw material, energy, and product distribution costs reduced PTOI by approximately $35 million. Higher fixed costs were largely driven by currency translation rates in the coatings 29 businesses, and by spending for growth initiatives in the titanium dioxide business. 2003 versus 2002 Sales of $5.5 billion increased 9 percent, principally due to 8 percent higher USD selling prices, which benefited from currency translation reflecting the stronger Euro and slightly higher prices on a local currency basis. Increased ownership interest in Renpar SA, a South American venture, increased sales 1 percent. Sales volumes were essentially flat, as higher worldwide sales of OEM and refinish coatings were offset by lower titanium dioxide volumes, the latter reflecting weak demand in North America during much of the year. PTOI was $735 million in 2003 versus $760 million in 2002. Results in 2003 were adversely affected by higher prices for raw materials and increased fixed costs, principally non-cash pension expense, which more than offset the benefits of higher revenue and more favorable currency translation. 2002 includes net charges of $66 million for employee separation costs. Outlook The segment expects to continue to increase sales in 2005, while reversing the decline in profitability which has been experienced the past three years. The global coatings industry will continue to provide a challenging operating environment in 2005 as competitive conditions are expected to remain intense. North American and Western Europe 2005 automotive builds are expected to be about flat versus 2004 levels, with continued, although less robust, growth expected in Asia Pacific. Continued growth is expected in China and Taiwan for coatings solution products serving the communication and computer markets, and in Japan for collision and ink products. Industry demand for titanium dioxide is expected to remain strong given continued moderate growth. This growth in demand, along with continued high capacity utilization, should result in a favorable business environment. Assuming moderate market growth, anticipated cost improvements, and the successful implementation of planned price increases, earnings growth is anticipated in 2005. ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2004 $ 3.3 $ 192 2003 2.9 183 2002 2.5 287 Electronic & Communication Technologies provides a broad range of advanced materials for the electronics industry, flexographic printing and color communication systems, and a wide range of fluoropolymer and fluorochemical products. The segment also continues to pursue development activities related to displays and fuel cells. In the electronics industry, markets served include display materials, integrated circuit fabrication materials and packaging solutions, and printed wire board fabrication materials. The segment meets the rapidly changing market needs for smaller, more portable and powerful electronic devices by building on its strength as a leading supplier of organic, flexible, and ceramic circuit materials. Major product lines include DuPont™ Kapton® polyimide film, Pyralux® flexible laminates, Riston® dry film photoresists, Green Tape™ low temperature co-fired ceramics, Fodel® photoimageable composites, and Posistrip® photoresist removers. During 2004, construction of a new Kapton® polyimide film production line to serve the rapidly growing flexible circuit industry in Asia Pacific was completed by a 50/50 joint venture in Japan. In addition, a 50/50 joint venture was formed in Korea to manufacture Pyralux® adhesiveless, flexible copper-clad laminate composites. Electronic & Communication Technologies is the market leader in flexographic printing and color communication serving the packaging and commercial printing industries. Its offerings include DuPont™ Cyrel® and Cyrel®FAST™ flexographic printing systems, as well as color communication systems, including DuPont™ WaterProof®, Cromalin®, and Dylux®. Cyrel®FAST™ is the only solvent-free thermal flexographic platemaking technology commercially available. During 2004, Electronic & Communication Technologies increased the number of locations using its Cromalin® digital proofing technology. DuPont is one of four companies offering thermal proofing technology, one of the fastest growing technologies in the market. This technology is 30 helping to offset the rapid decline in the analog proofing technology market. The segment also includes a portfolio of industrial and specialty fluorochemicals and fluoropolymers which are sold into the refrigeration, insulation, aerosol packaging, telecommunications, aerospace, automotive, electronics, chemical processing, and housewares industries. As the largest global manufacturer of fluoroproducts, the company's offerings include DuPont™ Suva® refrigerants, Teflon® and Tefzel® fluoropolymer resins, Autograph® and Teflon® non-stick finishes, and Teflon® and Tedlar® fluoropolymer films. Electronic & Communication Technologies leverages DuPont's strong materials and technology base to target growth opportunities in electronics, fluoropolymers, fluorochemicals, packaging graphics, and color communication. In semiconductor fabrication, packaging, and interconnect, the segment is extending and broadening its portfolio of materials to address critical needs in the industry, e.g., chemical mechanical planarization and embedded passives. In the rapidly growing market for flat panel displays, the segment continues to be a leading materials supplier for plasma displays. In addition, the segment is developing new innovative technologies for liquid crystal displays, such as thermal color filters, while continuing to invest in developing technologies such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and field emission displays. In packaging graphics, products such as Cyrel®FAST™ have rapidly grown, solidifying the segment's market leadership position. In fluoropolymers and fluorochemicals, the segment continues to pursue product renewal innovations such as next generation refrigerants, while broadening the scope of applications into high growth areas such as limited combustible cable. The company's research efforts on long-term growth opportunities such as fuel cells are showing solid technical progress, although commercial applications in transportation and portable power devices are not expected to advance for several years. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $3.3 billion increased 13 percent on 10 percent higher volumes and 3 percent higher USD selling prices. Higher volumes reflect a significant increase in demand for electronic materials, fluoropolymers, and refrigerants. Sales outside the U.S. grew 24 percent with sales in Asia Pacific up 36 percent. PTOI in 2004 was $192 million versus $183 million in 2003. The current year includes net charges of $67 million for employee separation costs and asset impairment charges, and $108 million for PFOA litigation (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). These charges were offset by earnings improvements resulting principally from higher volumes, productivity improvements, and targeted pricing actions throughout 2004. 2003 versus 2002 Sales of $2.9 billion were 14 percent higher than 2002, reflecting 10 percent volume growth as well as an increase of 4 percent attributable to the acquisition of ChemFirst, Inc.'s integrated circuit fabrication materials businesses in November 2002. Increased volumes reflect higher sales of electronic materials and fluoroproducts, including refrigerants and specialty gases, particularly in Asia Pacific. Increased sales volumes also reflect higher worldwide sales of flexographic printing products. These improvements were partly offset by continuing declines in the sales of older analog proofing products. PTOI was $183 million in 2003 versus $287 million in 2002. The decline in PTOI principally resulted from significantly higher expenditures for the development of OLEDs and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, reflecting, in part, higher non-cash pension costs. The benefit to PTOI from higher revenue was reduced somewhat by slightly higher raw material costs and a shift in fluoroproducts sales mix to lower margin products. Outlook In 2005, moderate revenue growth is expected to continue in the markets served by the segment, as year-over-year growth rates in electronics markets slow due to cyclical inventory adjustments, and other markets return to normal growth rates. 2004 results were adversely affected by charges for PFOA litigation. Apart from the impact of these charges, profitability is expected to improve through targeted pricing actions, continued focus on fixed cost control and new product introductions. 31 PERFORMANCE MATERIALS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2004 $ 6.6 $ 295 2003 5.4 410 2002 4.9 771 Performance Materials provides customers with more productive, higher performance polymer materials, systems and solutions to improve the uniqueness, functionality and profitability of their product offerings. Performance Materials delivers a broad polymer-based materials product portfolio, including engineering polymers that are primarily used by customers to fabricate components for mechanical and electrical systems, as well as specialized resins and films used in various packaging and industrial applications. These applications include food packaging, sealants and adhesives, sporting goods, and interlayers for laminated safety glass. Key brands include DuPont™ Zytel® nylon resins, Delrin® acetal resins, Hytrel® polyester thermoplastic elastomer resins, Tynex® filaments, Surlyn® resins, SentryGlas® Plus and Butacite® laminate interlayers, Mylar® and Melinex® polyester films, and Viton® fluoroelastomers. The key markets served by the segment include the automotive original equipment manufacturing and associated after-market industries, as well as electrical, electronics, packaging, construction, and consumer durable goods. The segment's core competency is applied materials science, focusing on substituting traditional materials with new materials that offer advantages such as performance, durability, aesthetics, and weight reduction. New applications and processing materials into innovative parts and systems are also areas of focus. A recent example of this core innovation capability is SentryGlas® Expressions™, which links DuPont™ polymer materials with ink jet technologies to develop specialty decorative interlayers for architectural applications. In 2003, the segment announced the rationalization of its engineering polymers compounding facilities, which includes realignment of its operations in Mexico, expansion of its operations in China, the shutdown of one of its production facilities in the Netherlands, and relocation of some of those assets to higher growth regions. The Netherlands shutdown was completed in the second half of 2004 and the relocated assets are scheduled to be in operation in early 2005. Additional compounding capacity was installed in both Shenzhen and Shanghai, China during 2004. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $6.6 billion were 23 percent higher than 2003, reflecting 9 percent volume growth driven by strong demand in the automotive, electronics, packaging, and construction markets. In addition, 2004 results reflect higher sales of films in Asia Pacific and packaging polymers in Europe, as well as an 8 percentage point benefit from the consolidation of DDE in April 2004 (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statments) and an increase in USD selling prices of 6 percent. PTOI was $295 million, down 28 percent from $410 million in 2003. The reduction in earnings reflects, in part, $268 million for DDE litigation (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), $67 million for employee separation costs and asset impairment charges, and about $325 million in higher costs for raw materials, principally those derived from oil and natural gas. These cost increases were largely offset by the benefit from higher sales volumes and USD selling prices. 2003 versus 2002 Sales of $5.4 billion were 9 percent higher than 2002, reflecting 7 percent volume growth, largely due to increased sales of engineering and packaging polymers in Europe and Asia Pacific. In addition, sales improved from 3 percent higher USD selling prices, reflecting the currency benefit of the weaker USD, partly offset by lower local currency selling prices. The growth in volume and increase in USD selling prices was partially offset by a 1 percent decrease in sales from the divestiture of the Clysar® shrink film business in 2002. PTOI was $410 million in 2003 compared with $771 million in 2002. The decrease in PTOI was primarily due to higher oil and natural gas-related raw material costs and recording transfers of nylon intermediates from Textiles & Interiors at market prices rather than cost in anticipation of the sale of INVISTA. PTOI in 2002 benefited from a $84 million gain on the sale of the Clysar® business. 32 Outlook North American and Western Europe 2005 automotive builds are expected to be flat versus 2004 levels, with continued, although less robust, growth expected in Asia Pacific. Global packaging market growth is projected to remain at current levels. The residential construction market is expected to remain strong, and it is anticipated that the electrical and electronics markets will continue to improve. Performance Materials expects continued revenue growth despite the planned sale of certain DDE assets (see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Pretax profit margins are expected to increase, driven by a combination of price increases and customer-driven innovations for products and processes. Results in 2004 were adversely affected by significant charges for DDE litigation. Apart from the impact of these charges, the level of earnings improvement in 2005 will depend on offsetting continued high petroleum-related raw material costs with price increases and further productivity gains. PHARMACEUTICALS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2004 $ – $ 681 2003 – 571 2002 – 493 On October 1, 2001, DuPont Pharmaceuticals was sold to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. DuPont retained its interest in Cozaar® (losartan potassium) and Hyzaar® (losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide). These Angiotensin II Antagonist (AIIA) drugs were discovered by DuPont and developed in collaboration with Merck & Co. (Merck) and are used in the treatment of hypertension. The U.S. patents covering the compounds, pharmaceutical formulation and use for the treatment of hypertension, including approval for pediatric use, will expire in 2010. DuPont has exclusively licensed worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights for Cozaar® and Hyzaar® to Merck. Pharmaceuticals receives royalties and net proceeds as outlined in these licenses and related agreements. Merck is responsible for manufacturing, marketing and selling Cozaar® and Hyzaar®. In September 2002, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cozaar® to reduce the rate of progression of nephropathy (kidney disease) in Type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension and nephropathy (hereafter referred to as the RENAAL study). Through 2004, approvals based on the RENAAL study have been granted in 52 countries, with further approvals pending. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study (LIFE) results were reported and published in March 2002 at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology. The study found that use of Cozaar® significantly reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) compared to the beta-blocker atenolol. In March 2003, the FDA approved Cozaar® as the first and only hypertensive medicine to help prevent stroke in patients with hypertension and LVH. In total, 59 countries have granted regulatory licenses to Cozaar® based on the LIFE study. In 2004, the FDA granted a new indication for Hyzaar® for initial use in appropriate patients with severe hypertension. This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients. 2004 versus 2003 Worldwide marketing and sales of Cozaar® and Hyzaar® are the responsibility of Merck. Pharmaceuticals receives royalties and net proceeds as outlined by the license agreements. 2004 PTOI was $681 million versus $571 million in 2003. 2003 included a $23 million benefit resulting from a favorable arbitration ruling. 2003 versus 2002 The 2003 PTOI was $571 million, including the benefit described above. The 2002 PTOI was $493 million, including $25 million of benefits primarily resulting from adjustments for the finalization of working capital, transfer of pension assets, and the settlement of tax liabilities related to the sale of DuPont Pharmaceuticals. Outlook Merck has identified Cozaar®/Hyzaar® as one of its key growth drivers. These AIIA drugs are the first of a new class of effective and well-tolerated blood pressure lowering medications, and are two of the leading treatments worldwide for hypertension. 33 DuPont and Merck continue to support the growth of Cozaar® and Hyzaar® with clinical studies designed to identify additional therapeutic benefits for patients with hypertension and co-morbid conditions. The company expects the ongoing Cozaar®/Hyzaar® collaboration to continue to be an important contributor to earnings until the U.S. patents expire in 2010. Thereafter, earnings are expected to decline significantly. SAFETY & PROTECTION Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2004 $ 4.7 $ 840 2003 4.1 807 2002 3.5 757 Safety & Protection builds on DuPont's 200-year history of being one of the safest industrial companies in the world and extends the company's knowledge and technology to deliver global solutions to protect people, property, operations and the environment. Safety & Protection applies a wide range of technologies, brands and know-how to expand its presence across a spectrum of industrial, service and residential markets. Highly recognized brands are included in its portfolio of product and service offerings, including DuPont™ Kevlar® and Nomex® aramid products; Tyvek® nonwoven sheet structures; Corian® solid surface materials; and safety consulting services, such as SafeReturns™ and the STOP™ family of training materials. The segment serves a large number of markets that range from construction, industrial chemical, oil, gas, and manufacturing to U.S. defense, homeland security, and safety consulting. It offers innovative building products and services to the global construction market, capitalizing on the company's competency in weatherization systems, security windows and structural integrity. It also provides a broad array of products related to personal protection, including garments and other apparel for protection against chemical, particulate, biological, thermal and cut hazards. Current offerings to the government include secure environmental treatment systems, specifications for use of DuPont™ SentryGlas® Plus interlayers in bomb-blast resistant windows, use of protective surfaces in military housing construction programs and expanded use of Kevlar®, focusing on military ballistic and other applications. Ongoing concerns with homeland security and the global war on terror led to order increases for military, law enforcement and fire fighting apparel. In 2004, global Tyvek® sales experienced double-digit growth, driven by continued market penetration, new applications, and growth in the North American and European construction markets. In addition, solid surface products experienced significant growth as they were able to better compete in emerging and global markets due to the Montelli acquisition in China. Global demand for products that prevent disease and improve productivity in the food, health care and industrial markets continue to create growth opportunities for the segment's clean and disinfect offerings, where revenue was 40 percent higher than 2003. In the health care marketplace, the segment launched Suprel™ nonwoven medical fabrics and received positive feedback from major U.S. hospitals regarding comfort and protection. With the acquisitions of UK-based Antec International in 2003, and U.S. based BioSentry in 2004, the segment established a presence in the animal health industry. The segment also expanded its environmental solutions offerings to the oil, gas, industrial and manufacturing markets. Overall revenue from environmental solutions offerings increased 29 percent compared to 2003. The segment experienced a 20 percent increase in global safety consulting revenues with substantial growth in emerging markets. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $4.7 billion were up 15 percent, due in part to 8 percent higher USD selling prices, largely reflecting the pass-through of higher aniline and other raw material costs via supply contracts. In addition, sales growth reflects 6 percent higher volumes and a 1 percent benefit from small acquisitions. Volume growth was primarily driven by greater worldwide sales of Kevlar® and Nomex® aramids for new and existing applications. Sales of Tyvek® nonwovens and solid surface products experienced double-digit growth, resulting from the strong construction market worldwide. 34 PTOI in 2004 was $840 million, up 4 percent from $807 million in the prior year. 2004 includes net charges of $70 million for employee separation costs and the impairment of certain European manufacturing assets. These charges were more than offset by improvements resulting from higher volumes and the weaker dollar. Higher local selling prices were offset by the negative effect of higher raw material costs and ongoing investment and growth. 2003 versus 2002 Sales of $4.1 billion were 17 percent higher, with 6 percent due to higher volumes, 6 percent due to higher USD selling prices and 5 percent due to acquisitions, primarily the November 2002 purchase of ChemFirst, Inc., whose chemical intermediate units were integrated into this segment. Volume growth was primarily driven by greater worldwide sales of Kevlar® and Nomex® aramids, reflecting increased demand for military, law enforcement and protective apparel products. Higher volume is also attributable to increased sales of Tyvek® nonwovens and Corian® solid surfaces, reflecting strength in residential construction and home improvement markets. Higher USD selling prices reflect both higher local currency prices as well as the benefit of the weaker dollar. PTOI in 2003 was $807 million compared to $757 million in 2002, reflecting the benefit of higher volumes and selling prices, partly offset by higher raw material and fixed costs, primarily non-cash pension expense. Outlook U.S. and global military and law enforcement demand for ballistic protection is expected to remain strong. Continued strong spending in emergency response markets through U.S. federal homeland security funding, as well as demand from the manufacturing sector in the U.S. and Europe, is expected to continue to support growth in personal protective systems. The construction industry is expected to remain strong and general improvement in industrial production is also expected to support growth in electrical insulation (transformers and motors), filtration, oil and gas products. Although the industrial chemicals product lines are also expected to benefit from this general improvement, margins are likely to continue to be pressured by energy-related costs, pockets of overcapacity and increased competition from Asia Pacific. Safety & Protection expects growth in revenue and earnings in 2005 based on continued market penetration and and the introduction of new technologies. TEXTILES & INTERIORS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2004 $ 3.3 $ (515 ) 2003 6.9 (1,892 ) 2002 6.2 89 On April 30, 2004, the company sold INVISTA to Koch for $3,844 million. Additional details regarding Textiles & Interiors are contained on page 20 under Separation Charges – Textiles & Interiors and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2005, any financial transactions relating to the remaining assets of Textiles & Interiors will be reported in Other. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $3.3 billion were 53 percent lower than the prior year, principally due to the sale of INVISTA on April 30, 2004. PTOI was a loss of $515 million in 2004, including $667 million in separation charges. 2003 PTOI was a loss of $1,892 million, including a net charge of $1,891 million primarily associated with the planned separation of INVISTA. 2003 versus 2002 Sales of $6.9 billion were 12 percent higher than 2002. This includes an 8 percent increase due to including transfers of nylon intermediates to Performance Materials at market prices versus cost beginning in 2003 in anticipation of the separation. Sales increased 4 percent due to a benefit from the weaker USD and slightly higher volumes, partly offset by lower local selling prices. PTOI was a loss of $1,892 million in 2003 versus earnings of $89 million in 2002. Results in 2003 include a net charge of $1,891 million, primarily associated with the planned sale of INVISTA. This charge reflects the write-down of various manufacturing assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and investments in certain joint ventures, together with a 35 pension curtailment loss and other separation costs. (Additional details are contained in Notes 5, 6, 9 and 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Results in 2003 also reflect higher costs for raw materials, principally those derived from petroleum, which reduced earnings by over $600 million. These raw material price increases, combined with higher non-cash pension expense, more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales, lower depreciation, and other cost reductions resulting from restructuring activities. PTOI in 2002 included a net charge of $204 million related to employee separation costs and asset impairments. OTHER The company combines the results of its nonaligned and embryonic businesses under Other. These businesses include bio-based materials and growth initiatives. Results related to the company's discontinued Benlate® fungicide business are also included (see Benlate® discussion in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In the aggregate, sales from these businesses represent significantly less than one percent of total segment sales. 2004 PTOI was a loss of $242 million versus a loss of $220 million in 2003. The 2004 loss includes $94 million for employee separation costs, a $29 million charge to write off abandoned technology, and a $20 million benefit from insurance proceeds related to Benlate® litigation. Pretax operating losses also reflect spending for bio-based materials and growth initiatives, as well as other costs, principally for discontinued businesses. 2003 PTOI was a loss of $220 million versus a loss of $265 million in 2002. The 2003 loss includes $78 million in charges associated with Benlate® litigation, as well as spending for bio-based materials and growth initiatives, and other costs, principally related to discontinued businesses. 2002 included $130 million for litigation costs. Liquidity & Capital Resources The company considers its strong financial position and financial flexibility to be a competitive advantage. The company's credit ratings of AA- and Aa3 from Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Investors Services (Moody's), respectively, and its commercial paper rating of A-1+ by S&P and Prime 1 by Moody's are evidence of that strength. This advantage is based on strong business operating cash flows over an economic cycle, and a commitment to cash discipline regarding working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of independent sources, including: Cash provided by operating activities, Cash and cash equivalents, Marketable debt securities, commercial paper markets, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets, and asset sales. The company's Cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in 2004, a $600 million increase from the $2.6 billion generated in 2003. The year-over-year increase is primarily the result of higher earnings. The improvement reflects higher selling prices, volume growth, and favorable currency exchange rates, partly offset by higher energy and raw material costs. The company's Cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion in 2003, a $150 million increase from the $2.4 billion generated in 2002. The year-over-year increase is a result of lower income tax payments, partially offset by higher raw material costs, termination of the accounts receivable securitization program and funding of the DuPont Canada pension fund in preparation for the separation of INVISTA. Cash and cash equivalents, and Marketable debt securities totaled $3.5 billion, $3.4 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to the $1.1 billion of cash used to purchase the shares of DuPont Canada from the minority owners in connection with the sale of INVISTA, and the redemption of corporate minority interest structures. The commercial paper market is a source of ""same day"" cash for the company. Given the company's strong credit rating, it has excellent access to this market at preferred rates. The weighted-average interest rates before taxes on commercial paper borrowings for 2004, 2003 and 2002, were 1.4, 1.1 and 1.7 percent, respectively. At December 31, DuPont's commercial paper balance was $600 million, 36 $4.4 billion and $700 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $3.8 billion decrease from 2003 to 2004 was primarily attributable to the use of proceeds from the sale of INVISTA to pay down commercial paper. The $3.7 billion increase from 2002 to 2003 was primarily related to activities to support INVISTA related items and the redemption of corporate minority interest structures. In the unlikely event that the company would not be able to meet its short-term liquidity needs, the company has access to approximately $3.3 billion in ""same day"" credit lines with several major financial institutions. These credit lines are split about equally between 364-day and multi-year facilities. DuPont also has access to equity markets and to long-term debt capital markets. The company's current relatively low long-term borrowing level, strong financial position and credit ratings provide excellent access to these markets. In April 2004, the company extended its long-term debt maturites with the issuance of $1.4 billion of six- and ten-year notes at very competitive rates. These notes essentially refinanced the $1.3 billion of maturing long-term notes due in 2004 and extended the company's maturity profile. In 2004, proceeds from asset sales were primarily related to the separation of Textiles & Interiors for $3,840 million (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). There were no material asset sales in 2003. In 2002, proceeds from sales of assets were $196 million, primarily reflecting $143 million received from the sale of the Clysar® shrink film business. In addition, there were $122 million of settlement payments to Bristol-Myers Squibb relating to the 2001 sale of DuPont Pharmaceuticals. USES OF CASH The company's cash discipline policy guides the use of cash. The tenets of the policy are first, to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Purchases of property, plant and equipment, and investments in affiliates were $1.3 billion in 2004, compared with $1.8 billion in 2003, including $334 million in synthetic leases, and $1.4 billion in 2002. The company expects purchases of property, plant and equipment in 2005 to be between $1.3 and $1.4 billion. There were no major acquisitions in 2004. Payments for businesses acquired in 2003 totaled $1.5 billion, primarily consisting of two acquisitions. In June and July 2003, the company acquired 66,704,465 shares in DuPont Canada from the minority owners for $1.1 billion. In May 2003, The Solae Company, a majority-owned subsidiary of the company, acquired 82 percent of Bunge Limited's Brazilian ingredients operation for $256 million, with the additional 18 percent acquired in the fourth quarter of 2003 for $44 million. Payments for businesses acquired in 2002 amounted to $697 million which includes the acquisition of ChemFirst, Inc. for $357 million, net of cash acquired, and the acquisition of all of the outstanding common shares of Liqui-Box Corporation for $272 million, net of cash acquired. Additional details related to the acquisitions are provided in Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The settlements of forward exchange contracts issued to hedge the company's net exposure, by currency, related to monetary assets and liabilities resulted in cash payments of $509 million in 2004, $631 million in 2003 and $264 million in 2002. The payments were primarily attributable to the weaker USD versus the Euro and larger net monetary asset positions. These settlements were largely offset by revaluations of the items being hedged, which are reflected in the appropriate categories in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1,404 million, $1,407 million and $1,401 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.40 in each year. During 2004, the company initiated purchases of shares under the $2 billion share buyback plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2001. As of December 31, 2004, 10.6 million shares at a cost of $457 million were purchased under this program. Management expects to continue purchasing stock under the buyback plan to offset dilution from shares issued under employee compensation plans. However, management has not established a timeline for the buyback of the remaining stock under this plan. In 2002, the company purchased 10.8 million shares for $470 million under a program previously authorized by the 37 Board. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of shares activity. New Legislation On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the ""Act""). The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. To qualify for the deduction, the earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan. Some of the options for reinvestment permitted in the Act include hiring and training workers, infrastructure and capital investments, research and development, debt repayment and funding of qualified benefit plan obligations. Uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions of the Act. The passage of statutory technical corrections and the issuance of other U.S. Treasury guidance with respect to certain provisions in the Act may determine what amounts, if any, the company will repatriate. DuPont is not yet in a position to determine whether, and to what extent, foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the United States may be repatriated. Under the Act, the company could repatriate up to $10 billion. However, no determination has been made as to how much, if any, will be repatriated. Furthermore, the related income tax effects cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. DuPont expects to be in a position to finalize its assessment by mid-year 2005. Because the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries are deemed to be permanently reinvested as of December 31, 2004, no deferred tax liability has been recognized in the company's financial statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION Total debt at December 31, 2004 was $6.5 billion, a decrease of $3.7 billion from December 31, 2003, primarily due to the use of proceeds from the sale of INVISTA to pay down commercial paper. In addition to the level of debt, the mix of the company's debt also changed. Commercial paper decreased $3.8 billion and in April 2004 the company issued $1.4 billion of six- and ten-year notes. These notes essentially refinanced the $1.3 billion of maturing long-term notes due in 2004 and extended the company's maturity profile. Total debt at the end of 2003 was $10.2 billion, a $3.4 billion increase from the $6.8 billion level at the end of 2002. Total debt increased in 2003 as a result of the redemption of the corporate minority interest structures, acquisition of the minority shares held in DuPont Canada, termination of the accounts receivable securitization and synthetic lease programs that were financed by the commercial paper conduit and buyout of certain synthetic leases (not covered under the commercial paper conduit). In addition, the company's debt increased $147 million, reflecting debt balances assumed as a result of acquiring the remaining interest in Griffin LLC. Additional information regarding the termination of the corporate minority interest structures is described below. The company's commercial paper increased $3.7 billion essentially for the reasons described above. The company's average interest rate at December 31 was 4.2%, 3.0% and 5.0% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The change in the rates is due primarily to the level of lower rate commercial paper at year-end. Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable debt securities were $3.5 billion, $3.3 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004, net debt was $2.9 billion, compared to $7.1 billion and $2.7 billion at year-end 2003 and 2002, respectively. The company defines net debt as total debt less Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable debt securities. Management believes that net debt is meaningful because it provides the investor with a more realistic view of the company's liquidity and debt position since the company's cash balance is available to meet operating and capital needs, as well as to provide liquidity around the world. Net debt also allows the investor to more easily compare cash flow between periods without adjusting for changes in cash and debt. 38 The following table reconciles the differences from Total debt to net debt. (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Total debt Commercial paper $ 584 $ 4,422 $ 668 Long-term debt due in one year 167 1,262 200 Other short-term debt 185 230 317 Total short-term debt 936 5,914 1,185 Long-term debt 5,548 4,301 5,647 Total debt $ 6,484 $ 10,215 $ 6,832 Cash and cash equivalents held for sale – 75 – Borrowings and capital leases held for sale (1 ) (264 ) – Cash and cash equivalents 3,369 3,273 3,678 Marketable debt securities 167 25 465 Net debt $ 2,949 $ 7,106 $ 2,689 The following table summarizes changes in net debt throughout 2004, 2003 and 2002. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net debt – beginning of year $ 7,106 $ 2,689 $ 966 Cash provided by continuing operations 3,231 2,589 2,439 Purchases of property, plant & equipment and investments in affiliates (1,298 ) (1,784 ) (1,416 ) Net payments for businesses acquired (119 ) (1,527 ) (697 ) Proceeds from sales of assets 68 17 196 Proceeds from sale of assets – Textiles & Interiors, net of cash sold 3,840 – – Debt assumed by Koch 255 – – Net proceeds from sale of DuPont Pharmaceuticals – – (122 ) Forward exchange contract settlements (509 ) (631 ) (264 ) Dividends paid to stockholders (1,404 ) (1,407 ) (1,401 ) Acquisition of treasury stock (457 ) – (470 ) Redemption of corporate minority interest structures – (2,037 ) – Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 404 425 186 Other 146 (62 ) (174 ) Decrease (increase) in net debt 4,157 (4,417 ) (1,723 ) Net debt – end of year $ 2,949 $ 7,106 $ 2,689 MINORITY INTEREST STRUCTURES In 2003, the company redeemed two minority interest structures for $2 billion and recorded a charge of $28 million primarily to write off the remaining unamortized costs associated with these transactions. These corporate structures had been established in 2001 and the associated costs were being amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period. CERTAIN GUARANTEE CONTRACTS Indemnifications The company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, and related business activities prior to the completion of the transactions. The terms of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and product liabilities, are generally indefinite. In addition, the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, against liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the company, such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters. If the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 is $99 million and $31 million, respectively. Although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued, due to the nature of indemnified items, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist. In connection with the sale of INVISTA, the company indemnified Koch against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal and environmental matters, and other representations and warranties. The estimated fair value of these obligations of $74 million is included in the indemnifications balance of $99 million at December 31, 2004. The fair value was based on management's best estimate of the value expected to be required to issue the indemnifications in a stand-alone, arm's length transaction with an unrelated party and, where appropriate, by the utilization of probability-weighted discounted net cash flow models. The company does not believe that these indemnities will have a material impact on the future liquidity of the company (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 39 Part II Obligations for Equity Affiliates and Others The company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates, customers, suppliers and other unaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2004, the company had directly guaranteed $655 million of such obligations, plus $333 million relating to guarantees of obligations for divested subsidiaries. This represents the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees. The company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2004, the liabilities recorded for these obligations were not material. Existing guarantees for customers and suppliers arose as part of contractual agreements. Existing guarantees for equity affiliates arose for liquidity needs in normal operations. In certain cases, the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers. The company has historically guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities related to divested subsidiaries including Conoco and its subsidiaries and affiliates, INVISTA entities sold to Koch, and Consolidation Coal Sales Company. The Restructuring, Transfer and Separation Agreement between DuPont and Conoco requires Conoco to use its best efforts to have Conoco, or any of its subsidiaries, substitute for DuPont. Conoco, Koch and Consolidation Coal Sales Company have indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2004, the company has no liabilities recorded for these obligations. Additional information with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees should unforeseen circumstances arise. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Commercial Paper Facility In 2002, the company implemented a commercial paper conduit program to reduce the financing costs of the company's accounts receivable securitization and synthetic lease programs by gaining direct access to the asset-backed commercial paper market. The conduit issued notes to third parties secured by the receivable interests and the equipment and real estate under synthetic leases. In 2003, the company terminated its accounts receivable securitization and synthetic lease programs that were financed by the commercial paper conduit. This required the company to purchase an ownership interest in the trade accounts receivable being held under the accounts receivable securitization program for $445 million and assets under synthetic leases for $144 million. The trade accounts receivable were collected in 2003. Other Synthetic Leases During 2003, the company purchased the assets under its synthetic leases related to manufacturing and warehousing facilities under construction (which were not covered under the commercial paper conduit) for $210 million. As of December 31, 2004, the company has one remaining synthetic lease program relating to miscellaneous short-lived equipment valued at approximately $123 million. Lease payments for these assets totaled $54 million in 2004, $43 million in 2003, and $28 million in 2002, and were reported as operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. The leases under this program are considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities are not recorded on the company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Furthermore, the lease payments associated with this program vary based on one month LIBOR. The company may terminate the program at any time by purchasing the assets. Should the company decide neither to renew the leases nor to exercise its purchase option, it must pay the owner a residual value guarantee amount, which may be recovered from a sale of the property to a third party. Residual value guarantees totaled $107 million at December 31, 2004. 40 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Information related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Payments Due In Total at December 31, 2004 2005 2006-2007 2008-2009 2010 and beyond Long-term debt 1 $ 5,682 $ 167 $ 1,114 $ 1,523 $ 2,878 Capital leases 1 36 3 1 1 31 Operating leases 796 301 252 132 111 Purchase obligations 2 Obligations to Koch 3 1,444 151 268 311 714 Raw material obligations (excluding Koch) 558 196 196 82 84 Advertising/sponsorships 43 26 17 – – Information technology infrastructure and services 73 21 27 8 17 Research and development agreements 83 49 23 4 7 Utility obligations 232 67 80 15 70 Other 4 61 23 38 – – Total purchase obligations 2,494 533 649 420 892 Other long-term liabilities 1,5 Workers' compensation 66 19 25 9 13 Asset retirement obligations 56 12 18 22 4 Environmental remediation 359 76 109 109 65 Other 6 121 25 18 17 61 Total other long-term liabilities 602 132 170 157 143 Total contractual obligations $ 9,610 $ 1,136 $ 2,186 $ 2,233 $ 4,055 1Included in the company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 2Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement. 3Includes raw material supply obligations of $1.1 billion and contract manufacturing obligations of $300 million. 4Primarily represents obligations associated with distribution, health care/benefit administration, and other professional and consulting contracts. 5Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have been excluded from the table as they are discussed below within Long-Term Employee Benefits. 6Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other postretirement benefits. The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations should unforeseen circumstances arise. 41 Long-Term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, and medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors. About 82 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions, and more than 99 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits are attributable to the benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension and medical, dental and life insurance benefits. Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In the U.S., pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with U.S. federal laws and regulations. The company does not make contributions that are in excess of federal tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. No contributions are currently required to be made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2005. The company will monitor asset values during 2005, and will determine later in the year whether a voluntary contribution is appropriate. Contributions beyond 2005 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. Pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, reduced asset valuations tend to result in higher contributions to pension plans. In 2004, the company contributed $709 million to its pension plans, including $300 million to its principal U.S. pension plan. The company anticipates that it will make approximately $245 million in contributions in 2005 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan. Generally accepted accounting principles require the full reflection of the amount of pension under-funding, if any, defined as the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the amount of pension assets as of the measurement date. To the extent this amount has not already been fully reflected, the company is required to reflect an additional minimum pension liability, and any adjustment is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income in Stockholders' equity. For this purpose, each of the company's pension plans must be tested individually. At year-end 2002, a non-cash after-tax charge of $2.5 billion to Stockholders' equity was recorded in response to lower asset valuations and somewhat higher benefit obligations as of that date. Most of this adjustment is attributable to the principal U.S. pension plan. In 2003 and 2004, $858 million and $1,245 million, respectively, of this charge was reversed, reflecting the net effect of recovering asset values, company contributions, and changes in discount rates. Medical, dental and life insurance plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $435 million, $410 million, and $400 million for 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $456 million in 2005. Changes in cash requirements during this period reflect higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles. The company's income can be significantly affected by pension benefits as well as retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the 42 last three years was affected by pretax charges and credits related to long-term employee benefits. Pretax (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Pension charges (credits) $ 997 $ 554 $ (217 ) Other postretirement benefit charges (credits) (241 ) 290 395 Net charge $ 756 $ 844 $ 178 These expenses are determined as of the beginning of each year. The 2004 increase in pension cost is primarily due to lower discount rates and settlement charges associated with the sale of INVISTA. The decrease in 2004 other postretirement benefit expenses reflects the effects of plan amendments made in 2002 and 2004 for its U.S. parent company medical and dental plans, and the curtailment gains recognized as part of the sale of INVISTA in 2004. The company's key assumptions used in calculating its long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases, and the discount rate (see Note 29 to the company's Consolidated Financial Statements). In anticipation of a significant reduction in the number of employees related to the pending INVISTA sale, the company recorded a pretax curtailment loss of $78 million in 2003. Upon completing the sale of INVISTA in 2004, the company recorded a pretax net settlement and curtailment gain of $436 million from its postretirement benefit plans other than pension, and a $446 million net settlement and curtailment charge for its pension plans. An additional $2 million curtailment charge was recorded in connection with 2004 restructuring programs. Environmental Matters DuPont operates global manufacturing facilities, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, DuPont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, eliminate the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of waste water discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future. While these costs may increase in the future, they are not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. In 2004, DuPont spent about $64 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects will total $106 million in 2005. In the U.S., significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures. Total CAA capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from $25 million to $40 million. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) challenged the U.S. chemical industry to voluntarily conduct screening level health and environmental effects testing on nearly 3,000 high production volume (HPV) chemicals or to make equivalent information publicly available. An HPV chemical is a chemical listed on the 1990 Inventory Update Rule with annual U.S. cumulative production and imports of one million pounds or more. Since 2001, DuPont has spent an estimated $2.5 million on HPV testing and estimates it will spend another $0.5 million to complete the original HPV testing program. An extended HPV program is under consideration by the American Chemistry Council that may result in another 10 to 15 chemicals being tested under DuPont's sponsorship. This extended program has not yet been approved. Since 2000, the entire chemical industry has spent an estimated $250 million on HPV testing. Global climate change is being addressed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Convention) adopted in 1992. The Kyoto Protocol (the Protocol), adopted in December 1997, is an effort to establish short-term actions under the Convention. The Protocol entered into force in February 2005 in most countries in 43 which DuPont operates. The United States has declined to ratify the Protocol. The European Union (EU) has already begun a program to reduce emissions that includes an emissions trading system linked to the Protocol. The United States continues to pursue a less-restrictive climate policy framework, emphasizing voluntary action. The Protocol establishes significant emission reduction targets for six gases considered to have global warming potential and is driving mandatory reductions in developed nations outside the United States. DuPont has a stake in a number of these gases–CO2, N2O, HFCs and PFCs–and has been reducing its emissions of these gases since 1991. DuPont remains well ahead of the target and timetable of the Protocol. However, the company faces the possibility of country-specific restrictions where major reductions have not yet been achieved and has faced high energy prices in Europe and the United States in recent years due, at least in part, to expectations of emission reduction mandates. DuPont is participating in emissions trading in the EU and elsewhere that could aid in satisfying such country-specific requirements. Emission reduction mandates within the United States are not expected in the near future, although Congressional proposals for such mandates have been introduced. DuPont has discovered that very low levels of dioxins (parts per trillion to low parts per billion) and related compounds are inadvertently generated during its titanium dioxide pigment production process. The company has launched an extensive research and process engineering development program to identify the cause of the dioxin generation and to identify process modifications that will eliminate dioxin formation. The programs implemented to date have resulted in reductions of almost 50 percent, significant progress against DuPont's aggressive goals to reduce such dioxin generation by 90 percent by 2007. Over 99 percent of the dioxin generated at DuPont's production plants becomes associated with process solid wastes that are disposed in controlled landfills where public exposure is negligible. DuPont uses PFOA, (perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt), as a processing aid to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. For a detailed discussion of environmental issues concerning PFOA, see Environmental Proceedings on page 9 of this report and Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pretax environmental expenses charged to current operations totaled $455 million in 2004 compared with $482 million in 2003, and $480 million in 2002. These expenses include the remediation accruals discussed below; operating, maintenance and depreciation costs for solid waste, air and water pollution control facilities, and the costs of environmental research activities. While expenses related to the costs of environmental research activities are not a significant component of the company's overall environmental expenses, the company expects these costs to become proportionally greater as the company increases its participation in businesses for which environmental assessments are required during product development. The largest of the environmental expenses in 2004 were $110 million from the operation of water pollution control facilities and $111 million for solid waste management facilities. About 83 percent of total annual environmental expenses resulted from operations in the United States. REMEDIATION ACCRUALS At December 31, 2004, the company's Consolidated Balance Sheet included an accrued liability of $359 million compared to $380 million at year-end 2003. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2004. Of the $359 million accrued liability, approximately 13 percent was reserved for non-U.S. facilities. Approximately 63 percent of the reserve balance was attributable to RCRA and similar remediation liabilities, while 24 percent was attributable to CERCLA liabilities. During 2004, remediation accruals of $58 million were added to the reserve and nearly $5 million of remediation liabilities were transferred to Koch as part of the sale of INVISTA. In 2003, $47 million was added to the reserve balance. 44 REMEDIATION EXPENDITURES RCRA extensively regulates and requires permits for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination at the facility. If conditions warrant, companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, the costs of the RCRA corrective action program are typically borne solely by the company. The company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required over the next two decades. Annual expenditures for the near term, however, are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. The company's expenditures associated with RCRA and similar remediation activities were approximately $43 million in 2004, $38 million in 2003, and $42 million in 2002. The company, from time to time, receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a PRP under CERCLA or similar state statute. The company has also, on occasion, been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company's past operations. As of December 31, 2004, the company had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA or state laws at 376 sites around the United States, with active remediation under way at 134 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at 141 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at four new sites during 2004 compared with five similar notices in 2003, and eight in 2002. In 2004, three sites were settled by the company. The company's expenditures associated with CERCLA and similar state remediation activities were approximately $27 million in 2004, $22 million in 2003, and $20 million in 2002. For nearly all Superfund sites, the company's potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other PRPs is relatively low. Other PRPs at sites where the company is a party typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and, where they do not, or where PRPs cannot be located, the company's own share of liability has not materially increased. There are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant, and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites, and at all CERCLA sites in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Total expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws were $74 million in 2004, $60 million in 2003, and $62 million in 2002. 45 Part II Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Under procedures and controls established by the company's Financial Risk Management Framework, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions and exchanges. In January 2004, the company terminated its broad-based foreign currency revenue hedging program, as well as its program to hedge natural gas purchases. All outstanding foreign currency and natural gas hedging positions related to these programs expired during 2004. However, certain business-specific foreign currency hedging programs will continue, as will hedging of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. In addition, the company will continue to enter into exchange traded agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge exposures relevant to agricultural feedstock purchases. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments, accounts receivable and derivatives. As part of the company's risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont, and monitors actual exposures versus established limits on a daily basis. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, short-and long-term investments, derivatives, and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed, and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. No one individual customer balance represents more than 5 percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance as of December 31, 2004. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses. The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The company's objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes. Accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, commitments and cash flows. The company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are minimized. In addition, option and forward exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion of certain anticipated foreign currency raw material purchases from vendors outside of the U.S. Gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the related foreign currency-denominated costs. From time to time, the company will enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Forward exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, 46 to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements and to place foreign currency deposits and marketable securities investments. INTEREST RATE RISK The company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR. Interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. COMMODITY PRICE RISK The company enters into exchange-traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. The company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory. Under these contracts, growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the market price of grain for a period of time following harvest. Derivative instruments, such as commodity futures that have a high correlation to the underlying commodity, are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers. The company utilizes agricultural commodity futures to manage the price volatility of soybean meal. These derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk. Additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. VALUE AT RISK A Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis provides a forward-looking perspective of the maximum potential loss in fair value for a defined period of time assuming normal market conditions and a given confidence level. The company's risk management portfolio consists of a variety of hedging instruments which provide protection from volatility in the areas of interest rates, foreign currency, agricultural commodities, and energy feedstock commodities. The valuations and risk calculations for the VaR analysis were conducted using the company's risk management portfolios as of December 31, 2004, and 2003. The average, high and low values reflected in the table were developed from each of the four quarters ended in 2004. The VaR analysis used a Monte Carlo simulation type model with a covariance matrix, and employed 3,000 pseudo-random market paths including all risk factors associated with the hedging instruments in the company's risk management portfolios. The calculations were conducted over a 20 business day period at a 95 percent confidence level. The following table details the results of the VaR analysis for each significant risk management portfolio at the end of both 2004 and 2003. VaR for the entire risk management portfolio is a loss of $150 million for 2004, and a loss of $77 million for 2003; these values reflect the diversification benefits and covariance correlation of the total portfolio. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Average High Low Foreign currency $ (191 ) $ (83 ) $ (246 ) $ (326 ) $ (161 ) Interest rates (61 ) (32 ) (70 ) (107 ) (35 ) Energy feedstock commodities – (6 ) – – – Agricultural commodities (23 ) (7 ) (10 ) (23 ) (4 ) The table above represents the VaR potential loss in fair value when each risk management portfolio is valued individually. The changes in portfolio VaRs in 2004 as compared to 2003 are due to increases in portfolio size, price volatility, and for interest rates, portfolio duration. The VaR model results are only an estimate and are not intended to forecast actual losses that may be incurred in future periods. Since the company's risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposures. 47",2023-12-30 21:51:41.305281

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cautionary Statements about Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements which may be identified by their use of words like ""plans,"" ""expects,"" ""will,"" ""anticipates,"" ""intends,"" ""projects,"" ""estimates"" or other words of similar meaning. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company's strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures, and financial results, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events. The company cannot guarantee that these assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. See the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part 1, Item 1A for a description of risk factors that could significantly affect the company's financial results. In addition, the following factors could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements: •As part of its strategy for growth, the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and form strategic alliances. There can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to the company. •The company has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity initiatives, including cost reduction programs, organizational restructurings and Six Sigma projects, to improve performance and generate cost savings. There can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to the company. Also, there can be no assurance that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized. Overview DuPont has six segments, five of which constitute the company's growth platforms: Agriculture & Nutrition, Coatings & Color Technologies, Electronic & Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, and Safety & Protection. The sixth segment, Pharmaceuticals, includes income from the company's interest in two anti-hypertension (AIIA) drugs, Cozaar® and Hyzaar®. The company has set sustainable annual financial targets of 6 percent revenue growth, 10 percent earnings growth, and one percentage point improvement in Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). The company's three key strategies to achieve these targets are: Putting Science to Work, Harnessing the Power of One DuPont, and Going Where the Growth Is. Putting Science to Work–Science helps form the capabilities, offerings and competitive advantages of all of the company's businesses. The company's research and development programs are focused on creating new technologies, processes, and business opportunities in relevant fields, as well as improving existing products and processes. The future of the company is not dependent on any single research program. The company continues to aggressively grow and manage its patent portfolio. Market-driven innovation, which relies on the voice of the customer and concrete market opportunities, is central to the company's research efforts. Management is focused on prioritizing deployment of resources to the most promising opportunities and has identified its top 75 technology projects expected to generate commercial success. The company is accelerating science-based innovation by 30 percent by prioritizing programs for faster and larger payoffs. Power of One DuPont–The company's strategy is to increase productivity and leverage market access, capabilities and customers, with a single focus, thereby creating wider opportunities for its businesses. Management is committed to holding its fixed costs flat in 2006 and reducing fixed cost as a percentage of sales. The company is also taking actions to standardize and simplify its supply chains and support functions globally and improve its sales effectiveness. As a result of these actions, management expects to generate $1 billion of cost savings and $1 billion of working capital savings over three years. Furthermore, management has committed to improving its return on invested capital. Over an eighteen-month period ending June 30, 2007, underperforming assets within each growth platform will be reviewed and appropriate plans put in place to improve the return on these assets to acceptable levels. 18 Going Where the Growth Is–The Company seeks significant growth opportunities by increasing its direct presence and sales efforts in emerging markets and extending the company's science, products, brands and market position into new applications and uses, thereby creating new markets. The company has a strong presence in the fastest-growing emerging markets and continues to leverage its resources and market position to realize new growth. Analysis of Operations During 2005, the company maintained its leading position in biotechnology, safety and protection, and crop yield improvement, and continued to execute its growth strategies, while overcoming a number of operational and business challenges. The most significant of these challenges were record-high energy costs, in addition to the aftermath of two major hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, which struck the Gulf Coast region of the U.S. Management estimates that cost increases for raw materials in 2005 exceeded $1 billion versus the prior year, principally reflecting higher market prices for oil, natural gas, and hydrocarbon feedstock. The company took actions to increase pricing and improve productivity to offset these cost increases. The company has 14 manufacturing plants located in the Gulf Coast region that were affected by the hurricanes. Ten of these had minimal damage and resumed operations quickly. Four plants, two in Mississippi and two in Texas, experienced serious damage to electrical systems, instrument controls and computer-based electronic process control systems. Charges of $160 million were recorded in 2005 related to the clean up and repair of manufacturing assets, the write off of inventory and plant assets destroyed by the hurricanes and other hurricane related costs. The most significant damage was to the company's DeLisle, Mississippi, titanium dioxide plant which remained shut down from August 2005 until production began a phased-in restart in January 2006. Management expects this plant to return to normal operations during the second quarter of 2006. The resumption of operations at the other three sites was completed by December 31, 2005. All sites remain structurally sound and environmentally secure. Following the hurricanes, the company declared ""force majeure"" for several product lines of the Coatings & Color Technologies, Safety & Protection and the Performance Materials segments manufactured at the four sites noted above, because of hurricane-induced plant outages, limited availability of purchased utilities and raw materials, and damaged infrastructure. Management estimates that the company lost sales of about $350 million in 2005 as a result of the hurricanes. The company carries property damage and business interruption insurance, subject to deductible amounts. The amount or timing of any insurance recoveries are not yet determinable. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 NET SALES $ 26,639 $ 27,340 $ 26,996 2005 versus 2004 Consolidated net sales for 2005 were $26.6 billion, down 3 percent. The 2004 sale of INVISTA resulted in a $2.1 billion or 8 percent reduction in Net sales. This reduction was partly offset by a 6 percent increase in sales resulting from higher U.S. dollar (USD) selling prices. 19 The tables below show a regional breakdown of 2005 and 2004 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year: Percent Change Due to: 2005 Net Sales Percent Change vs. 2004 (Dollars in billions) Local Price Currency Effect Volume Other1 Worldwide2 $ 26.6 (3 ) 5 1 (1 ) (8 ) United States 11.1 (4 ) 6 0 (2 ) (8 ) Europe 7.7 (4 ) 3 2 (3 ) (6 ) Asia Pacific 4.5 (4 ) 5 1 2 (12 ) Canada & Latin America 3.3 9 4 6 4 (5 ) 1Percentage changes in sales due to the absence of $2,108 million in sales attributable to the divested Textiles & Interiors business in 2004. 2Sales related to elastomers businesses transferred to Dow on June 30, 2005 were $386 million and $467 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily in the United States and Asia Pacific. Excluding these sales, the company's worldwide sales were $26.2 billion in 2005, down 2 percent from 2004 with volume essentially flat. In 2005, growth in key markets, particularly those in Asia Pacific and Latin America, helped offset the reduction in U.S. volumes. Volume declines in the United States and Europe were related to lower demand in motor vehicle and production agriculture markets, and the impact of hurricanes. 2004 versus 2003 Consolidated net sales for 2004 were $27.3 billion, up one percent. Portfolio changes, principally the sale of INVISTA, partly offset by the consolidation of DuPont Dow Elastomers LLC (DDE) as a variable interest entity (VIE) and the benefit of small acquisitions, resulted in a $2.6 billion or 10 percent reduction in Net sales. The combination of higher sales volumes and USD selling prices increased sales 11 percent.

In 2004, the company saw strength in its major markets, including motor vehicle production and related after-markets, production agriculture and construction. Growth in these key markets, particularly in Asia Pacific, as well as increased market share, contributed to a 6 percent increase in worldwide sales volumes, which helped offset a $3.8 billion reduction in sales as a result of the sale of INVISTA. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 OTHER INCOME, NET $ 1,852 $ 655 $ 734 2005 versus 2004 Other income increased $1,197 million over 2004. The increase is primarily due to net pre-tax exchange gains in 2005 of $423 million compared to losses in 2004 of $391 million (see page 52 for a discussion of the company's program to manage currency risk and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The company records royalty revenues 20 related to its licensees for Cozaar®/Hyzaar® in Other income. Royalty income related to these products was $747 million and $675 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Equity in the earnings of affiliates increased $147 million over 2004, primarily due to the absence of a $150 million elastomers antitrust litigation charge in the DDE joint venture recorded in 2004 (discussed in detail in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 2004 versus 2003 Other income decreased $79 million in 2004. This reduction is primarily due to a $257 million increase in net pre-tax exchange losses and a loss of $49 million for equity affiliates as a result of the $150 million charge to provide for the company's share of anticipated losses associated with elastomers antitrust litigation. These losses were largely offset by a $118 million increase in interest income, $50 million of which was attributable to the reversal of accrued interest related to certain prior year tax contingencies, and a $102 million increase in royalty income associated with Cozaar®/Hyzaar®. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES $19,701 $20,416 $20,759 As a percent of Net sales 74% 75% 77% 2005 versus 2004 Cost of goods sold and other operating charges (COGS) for the year 2005 was $19.7 billion, a decrease of $715 million from the prior year. 2005 COGS includes a $160 million hurricane charge. 2004 COGS included a $108 million litigation charge related to PFOA and a charge of $118 million related to elastomers antitrust litigation (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As a percent of sales, COGS was 74 percent in 2005 versus 75 percent in 2004. The improvement principally reflects the sale of INVISTA, which had higher COGS in relation to sales than the rest of the company, partly offset by raw material costs that escalated at a higher rate than the increases in selling prices. A modestly favorable effect of currency translation offset a small decrease in sales volumes. 2004 versus 2003 COGS declined $343 million. As a percent of Net sales, COGS was down 2 percentage points. The decrease relative to sales reflects a significant benefit from portfolio changes, principally the sale of INVISTA, which had higher COGS in relation to sales than the rest of the company. COGS as a percent of sales also improved due to higher local selling prices and increased sales volumes with higher gross margins due to improved operating rates, lower plant operating costs, and higher manufacturing yields. The currency impact from the weaker USD also had a positive impact as its benefit to sales exceeded its concurrent increase in COGS. The positive factors discussed above were partly offset by increased litigation charges and significantly higher raw material costs. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $3,223 $3,141 $3,067 As a percent of Net sales 12% 11% 11% 2005 versus 2004 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $82 million and one percentage point as a percent of sales. The increase as a percent of sales reflects the absence of INVISTA that had lower selling expenses as a percent of sales compared to the rest of the company. 2004 versus 2003 SG&A expenses increased $74 million or 2 percent. The increase principally reflects higher spending for strategic growth initiatives, particularly in Agriculture & Nutrition, the impact of currency translation, and the impact of consolidating the DDE joint venture. These increases were partly offset by cost reduction programs and the sale of INVISTA in April 2004. 21 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE $1,336 $1,333 $1,349 As a percent of Net sales 5% 5% 5% Research and development expense as a percent of sales remained constant over the three-year period. Spending in 2005 reflects increases across most segments, offset by the absence of spending in Textiles & Interiors after April 30, 2004. The company continues to support a strong commitment to research and development as a source of sustainable growth, and expects research and development funding to remain at about the same level in 2006. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 INTEREST EXPENSE $518 $362 $347 2005 versus 2004 Interest expense increased $156 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in the average interest rates from 3.46 percent to 4.60 percent. Average borrowings were 3 percent higher in 2005. 2004 versus 2003 2004 Interest expense was $15 million higher than 2003. This increase reflects the impact of higher average debt levels, partly offset by lower average interest rates. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 EMPLOYEE SEPARATION ACTIVITIES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES $(13) $411 $(17) 2005 Activities The company did not institute any restructuring programs in 2005. A benefit of $13 million was recorded in the fourth quarter to reflect changes in estimates related to employee separations that were implemented in earlier years. Cost reductions associated with prior year plans were realized in 2005; however, these savings were offset by other cost increases. Additional details related to these previously announced employee separation programs are contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2004 Activities The company initiated actions in 2004 to ensure its global competitiveness as a more focused, science-based company. The company recorded a net charge of $411 million in 2004 related to employee separation costs and asset impairment charges. This included $302 million to provide severance benefits for approximately 2,700 employees involved in manufacturing, marketing and sales, administrative and technical activities. Essentially all of these employees were separated as of December 31, 2005. These staff reductions affected essentially all segments. The company also recorded a benefit of $12 million in 2004 resulting from changes in estimates for prior years' restructuring programs. In addition, the company recorded impairment charges of $121 million in 2004 which included: $27 million to reflect an other than temporary decline in the value of an investment security; $23 million related to the shutdown of U.S. manufacturing assets; $42 million related to the write down of certain European manufacturing assets; and $29 million to write off abandoned technology. In the aggregate, payments from operating cash flows to terminated employees total about $300 million. Approximately 44 percent of these cash outlays were made in 2004 with another 45 percent made in 2005. The remainder will be paid in 2006 and thereafter. Annual pretax cost savings of about $225 million per year are associated with the restructuring plan. About 40 percent was realized in 2004 and essentially all the remaining savings in payroll costs were realized in 2005. Over 50 percent of the savings associated with the staff reductions are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses, approximately 30 percent in COGS and other operating charges, and the balance in Research and development expense. 22 2003 Activities The company did not institute any restructuring programs in 2003. A benefit of $17 million was recorded in 2003 to reflect changes in estimates related to employee separations that were implemented in earlier years. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 SEPARATION ACTIVITIES–TEXTILES & INTERIORS $(62) $667 $1,620 On April 30, 2004, the company sold a majority of the net assets of Textiles & Interiors, referred to as INVISTA, to Koch. During 2005, the company sold its investments in three affiliated companies to Koch and its investment in a fourth affiliated company to its equity partner. In January 2006, the company completed the sale of its interest in the last equity affiliate to its equity partner for proceeds of $14 million thereby completing the sale of all of the net assets of Textiles & Interiors. In 2005, the company recorded a net benefit of $62 million resulting from divestiture activities. The company's transfer of its interest in the affiliates to Koch resulted in a gain of $35 million. The sale of two of these affiliates had been delayed until the company received approval from its equity partners. Although the transfer of these affiliates completes the sale to Koch, the company will have significant continuing involvement with INVISTA as a result of long-term purchase and supply contracts and a long-term contract manufacturing agreement in which INVISTA will manufacture and supply certain products for the company. In addition, the company indemnified Koch against certain liabilities, primarily related to taxes, legal matters, environmental matters, and representations and warranties (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The company's total indemnification obligation for the majority of the representations and warranties can not exceed approximately $1.4 billion. The company also recorded a gain of $29 million in 2005 related to the sale of the company's investment in another equity affiliate and $2 million of other charges associated with the separation. Net cash proceeds from these transactions totaled $135 million. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the charges that were recorded in 2004 and 2003. At September 30, 2003, the company reclassified to assets held for sale the INVISTA related assets. Upon reclassification the company ceased depreciation and amortization of these assets which improved earnings by approximately $0.10 in 2004 and $0.07 in 2003. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT–TEXTILES & INTERIORS – – $ 295 In 2003, in connection with the pending sale of INVISTA, the company was required to test the related goodwill for recoverability. This test indicated that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded fair value, and accordingly, the company recorded an impairment charge of $295 million to write-off all of the goodwill associated with INVISTA. This write-off was based on an estimate of fair value as determined by the negotiated sales price of the INVISTA net assets. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 NONOPERATING GAIN – – $ 62 In 2003, the company recognized a $62 million gain associated with the formation of a majority-owned venture, The Solae Company, with Bunge Limited.

AJCA created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations provided that repatriated cash from such accumulated earnings is reinvested in the U.S. pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan. In 2004, the company recorded significant tax benefits which principally included $360 million on exchange losses in connection with the company's foreign currency hedging program, $320 million related to the separation of Textiles & Interiors, $160 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year audit issues previously reserved, and $137 million resulting from recording deferred tax assets in two European subsidiaries for tax basis investment losses recognized on local tax returns. These tax benefits were partly offset by net tax expense on other operating results. In 2003, the company also recorded significant tax benefits which principally included $669 million related to recording deferred tax assets in two European subsidiaries for tax basis investment losses recognized on local tax returns, $544 million related to the separation of Textiles & Interiors, and $187 million on exchange losses in connection with the company's foreign currency hedging program. These tax benefits were partly offset by net tax expense on other operating results. The company's current estimate of the 2006 effective income tax rate is about 26 percent, excluding tax effects of exchange gains and losses which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 MINORITY INTERESTS IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES $ 37 $ (9 ) $ 71 Minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries in 2005 reflects earnings in the first half of 2005 for DDE and the absence of minority interests in subsidiaries transferred to Koch. Minority interests in losses of consolidated subsidiaries in 2004 reflect the consolidation of DDE as a VIE in April 2004. 2003 includes expenses associated with the redemption of corporate minority interest structures. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE – – $ (29 ) On January 1, 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 143, ""Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,"" which requires companies to record an asset and related liability for the costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived tangible asset if a legal liability to retire the asset exists. The adoption of this standard resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle after-tax charge to income of $29 million. 24 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 NET INCOME $ 2,053 $ 1,780 $ 973 2005 versus 2004 Net income for 2005 increased 15 percent over 2004. 2005 Net income reflects higher selling prices which essentially offset record increases in raw material costs and higher fixed costs. In addition, 2005 results include significant hurricane related charges as well as tax expenses associated with the repatriation of cash under the AJCA. In contrast, 2004 results were adversely affected by even greater charges resulting from a corporate restructuring program, losses on the separation of Textiles & Interiors, and charges for certain elastomers antitrust matters and litigation related to PFOA. Earnings per share were $2.07 in 2005 versus $1.77 in 2004, a 17 percent increase. This includes a 2 percentage point benefit from lower shares outstanding resulting from the accelerated share repurchase program. 2004 versus 2003 Net income for 2004 was $1,780 million compared to $973 million for 2003. Higher Net income reflects higher sales volumes, higher local currency prices and currency benefit from the weaker USD. In addition, cost improvement efforts helped to offset general inflation in operating costs and higher planned spending for growth initiatives. Net income increased despite significantly higher raw material costs. Earnings per share were $1.77 in 2004 versus $0.96 in 2003. Corporate Outlook The company anticipates record-high energy costs and increasing competitive pressures in 2006. Accordingly, the company plans to accelerate execution of its growth strategies by intensifying market-driven research and development efforts, expanding in higher-growth markets, and implementing numerous productivity measures. Management believes that raw material costs will be higher than those of 2005, as oil and U.S. natural gas prices are expected to be above 2005 average levels. While the 2006 rate of global GDP and industrial production growth is forecast to continue at or near 2005 levels, growth by industry will be mixed, with flat to slower growth expected in motor vehicle and residential construction related markets, and somewhat stronger growth in commercial construction. In addition, the value of the USD is forecast to be stronger than the 2005 average, adversely affecting the results of the company's operations outside of the U.S. On the positive side, the company expects that its 2006 costs for pensions and other postretirement benefits will be lower than those for 2005. Based on these expectations, management estimates that earnings per share will be about $2.60 in 2006, with Net sales of about $28 billion. Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, which replaces SFAS No. 123, ""Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."" DuPont voluntarily adopted the SFAS No. 123 fair value based method of accounting on January 1, 2003, for share-based payment transactions with employees. SFAS No. 123R amends some aspects of the fair value measurement of the equity instruments granted to employees. This statement becomes effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of 2006. The company will use the modified prospective method and will continue to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as the most appropriate fair-value method for its awards. Based on the company's evaluation, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is not expected to have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 25 Critical Accounting Estimates The company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring reserves, environmental matters, and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS Accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions at least annually. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis, and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan obligations or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining working life of current employees. About 83 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other postretirement benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. The company utilizes published long-term high quality bond indices to determine the discount rate at the measurement date. Where commonly available, the company considers indices of various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy and projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than their fair value. Accordingly, there tends to be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair market value of assets is not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net pension cost. The market-related value for the principal U.S. pension plan was $15.9 billion and $13.6 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The corresponding fair value was $16.6 billion and $15.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For other plans, pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets. The fair value of assets in all pension plans was $20 billion at December 31, 2005, and the related projected benefit obligations were $23 billion. In addition, obligations under the company's unfunded other postretirement benefit plans were $4 billion at December 31, 2005. 26 The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pretax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2005: (Dollars in millions) 1/2 Percentage Point Increase 1/2 Percentage Point Decrease Discount rate $ 82 $ (88 ) Expected rate of return on plan pension assets 92 (92 ) Additional information with respect to pension and other postretirement employee expenses, liabilities, and assumptions is discussed under Long-term Employee Benefits beginning on page 45. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs at multiparty sites, and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. The company has recorded a liability of $343 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued. Much of this liability results from the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, often referred to as the Superfund), RCRA and similar state laws. These laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. Federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations, and could, among other things, impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company-generated waste disposal. Over the next two decades, the company could incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities, and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of PRPs. Therefore, it is difficult to develop accurate estimates of future site remediation costs. A detailed discussion of environmental matters is contained in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 47. LEGAL CONTINGENCIES The company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement claims and antitrust claims. The company records reserves for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these reserves to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits, and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management 27 considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation reserve when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INCOME TAXES The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the ultimate taxes the company will pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material. At December 31, 2005, the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of $748 million, net of valuation allowance of $1,363 million. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. During 2006, it is reasonably possible that valuation allowances related to the deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries estimated to be about $200 million will be reversed if improved business performance in those subsidiaries is sustained. This potential valuation allowance reversal is not reflected in the company's current estimate of the 2006 effective income tax rate of about 26 percent. At December 31, 2005, the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of valuation allowances of $1,086 million. Of this amount, $878 million has no expiration date, $20 million expires after 2005 but before the end of 2010, and $188 million expires after 2010. 28 VALUATION OF ASSETS Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other purchased intangible assets, and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of long-lived assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's businesses operate and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on both the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time at which such impairments are recognized. Future changes in the environment and the economic outlook for the assets being evaluated could also result in additional impairment charges. Information with respect to the company's significant accounting policies on long-lived assets is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Reviews Segment sales include transfers and a pro rata share of equity affiliates' sales. Segment pretax operating income (PTOI) is defined as operating income before income taxes, minority interests, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses, interest, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated Net sales and segment PTOI to Income before income taxes and minority interests for 2005, 2004 and 2003 is included in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2005 $ 6.4 $ 862 2004 6.2 769 2003 5.5 671 Agriculture & Nutrition leverages DuPont technology, customer relationships and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply. Global land area that can be used in agricultural production is increasingly limited. Therefore, increases in production will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted acreage. Agriculture & Nutrition delivers a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. The segment operates across the food value chain from inputs for production agriculture to global production and distribution of soy-based food ingredients, food quality diagnostic testing equipment and services, and liquid food packaging systems. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and enhance the value of grains and soy through improved seed traits, superior germplasm, and the effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Agriculture & Nutrition includes the company's wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer, which is the world's leading seed brand and the world leader in improving crop yields with hybrid and varietal seeds that improve grower yields and provide insect protection and herbicide tolerance. The principal products of Pioneer are hybrid seed corn and soybean seed. In 2005, farmers in North America demonstrated a preference for corn hybrids containing biotechnology traits and Pioneer had limited supplies of these products. As a result, corn market share in North America declined. In soybeans, Pioneer increased market share in 29 key segments supported by strong product performance. Pioneer benefited from the global launch of 26 new soybean varieties and 95 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids that include new combinations of corn borer, corn rootworm and weed management traits highlighted by the expansion of the Herculex®1 family of traits. Agriculture & Nutrition also serves the global production agriculture industry with crop protection products in the grain and specialty crop sectors, forestry, and vegetation management. Principal crop protection products are herbicides, fungicides, insect control products and plant growth regulators. Sales of crop protection products increased slightly, with the most significant growth in insecticides, specifically in specialty crops in Latin America and cereals in Europe. The segment also continued to strengthen its global position in products for cotton due to its broad array of offerings, expanded its presence in fruit and vegetable specialty markets and continues to expand product offerings in the professional pest control market. Agriculture & Nutrition also serves the specialty food ingredients market, including soy proteins and lecithins through its majority-owned venture with Bunge Limited, The Solae Company. Sales from these products declined modestly in 2005, primarily due to reduced sales in parts of Europe and Asia Pacific. 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $6.4 billion increased 2 percent reflecting 4 percent higher USD selling prices and 2 percent lower volumes. Higher selling prices reflect a richer mix in corn and soybean seed. Volume declines were driven by lower corn seed sales in North America and specialty food ingredients partially offset by increases in the sale of soybeans, insecticides in Latin America and herbicides for cereals in Europe. During the year approximately 160 new products and product applications were introduced. 2005 PTOI was $862 million versus $769 million in 2004, up 12 percent. The improvement in 2005 PTOI reflects higher USD selling prices partially offset by lower volumes and higher raw material costs. 2004 results also included restructuring charges of $34 million. In addition, during 2005 the segment continued to increase research spending and drive productivity improvements while managing overall fixed costs to a level consistent with 2004. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $6.2 billion increased 14 percent reflecting 7 percent higher selling prices, 4 percent higher volumes, and a 3 percent benefit resulting from the formation of The Solae Company and the acquisition of the remaining interest in Griffin LLC. Higher selling prices were driven by a richer mix in corn and soybean seed, reflecting the success of the 2004 technology offering. Volume growth was driven by higher corn sales throughout all regions as well as increased soybean sales in the Northern Hemisphere, higher sales of insecticides in Asia Pacific and higher worldwide sales of soy-based products. 2004 PTOI was $769 million versus $671 million in 2003, up 14 percent. The improvement in 2004 PTOI reflects higher selling prices and higher sales volumes, partly offset by higher raw material costs. 2004 results also included restructuring charges of $34 million, whereas 2003 included a benefit of $64 million, principally related to the formation of The Solae Company. Outlook In 2006, the segment is anticipating modest earnings growth through a continued focus on providing value to its customers. Pioneer expects to increase its corn value offerings, including stacked traits and seed treatments in the U.S. and Canada, and grow corn volumes in key international markets. Pioneer also expects continued market share gains in key soybean markets including the U.S., Canada and Brazil. The segment's introduction of new crop protection products is projected to drive volume gains. Segment margins will be challenged by an expected acre shift from corn to lower margin soybeans along with higher raw material costs and continued investments in research, which will drive long-term profitability. 1Registered Trademark of Dow AgroSciences LLC 30 Technology will continue to play an important role for Agriculture & Nutrition. Pioneer will build on their global product offerings with the addition of 20 new soybean varieties and 90 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids. In late February, 2006, DuPont announced an agreement with Syngenta to acquire certain crop protection product rights and to sell an exclusive license to technology, on which a gain is expected to be recognized in the first half of 2006. COATINGS & COLOR TECHNOLOGIES Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2005 $ 6.2 $ 564 2004 6.0 718 2003 5.5 735 Coatings & Color Technologies is one of the world's leading automotive coatings suppliers and the world's largest manufacturer of titanium dioxide white pigments. Products offered include high performance liquid and powder coatings for automotive OEMs, the automotive aftermarket (known as refinish), and general industrial applications, such as coatings for bridges, windmills, heavy equipment, pipes and appliances. The company markets its refinish products using the DuPont™, Standox®, Spies Hecker®, and Nason® brand names. Standox® and Spies Hecker® are focused on the high-end refinish markets, while Nason® is primarily focused on economy coating applications. The segment's broad line of DuPont™ Ti-Pure® titanium dioxide products, in both slurry and powder form, serve the coatings, plastic, and paper industries. The segment also offers specialty products for ink jet digital printing including pigment and dye based inks and the DuPont™ Artistri™ printing systems for textiles. Specialty products include adhesive bonding and electrical insulation. The key markets in which Coatings & Color Technologies operates continued to grow in 2005, with more significant growth in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions. A key driver of the segment's sales growth in 2005 was the successful implementation of global price increases, most notably, for titanium dioxide white pigment and refinish products. Global demand for titanium dioxide white pigment remained consistent with 2004 levels. Sales volumes for major global producers of titanium dioxide white pigment declined by approximately 4 to 6 percent, while volumes increased for small producers in China, India, and Eastern Europe which generally provide lower performance and lower price products. During the first half of the year, the company's market share grew slightly; however, share in the second half declined as a result of hurricane damage to the company's DeLisle plant. Sales for refinish products grew in all regions, most notably in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. While the OEM market realized growth in Latin America, it was more than offset by declines in the U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific. This reflects flat or lower North American and European builds of automobiles and light trucks. Powder coatings remained flat in Europe, while the demand in the U.S. and Latin America showed improvement. Worldwide sales in the specialty coatings, electrical insulation and metal coatings markets continued to improve, while adhesives remained flat. 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $6.2 billion were up 3 percent, reflecting 6 percent higher USD selling prices, partly offset by 3 percent lower volumes. Higher selling prices reflect concerted efforts within the segment to increase prices for the majority of its products as part of its efforts to offset the impact of higher raw material costs. Sales volumes were lower due to the DeLisle plant outage and the impact of lower global OEM automotive volumes. During the year approximately 360 new products and product applications were introduced. 31 PTOI in 2005 of $564 million decreased from $718 million in the prior year. Higher raw material costs and lower sales volumes negatively affected 2005 earnings. PTOI in 2005 includes a $116 million hurricane charge while 2004 included charges of $96 million for employee separation costs and an automotive refinish litigation settlement. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $6.0 billion increased 10 percent, principally reflecting a 5 percent benefit from the weaker dollar, 3 percent higher sales volumes, and 2 percent higher local prices. The increase in volumes is primarily related to titanium dioxide as capacity utilization for global titanium dioxide producers grew throughout the year, with all major producers essentially sold out beginning late in third quarter 2004. OEM coatings volume growth moderated in the second half as major auto producers, particularly in the U.S., announced production cutbacks to reduce new car inventories. PTOI was $718 million in 2004, down slightly from $735 million in 2003. Higher sales volumes and local selling price increases essentially offset net charges totaling $60 million for employee separation costs and $36 million related to the automotive refinishes litigation settlement (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Higher raw material, energy, and product distribution costs reduced PTOI by approximately $35 million. Higher fixed costs were largely driven by currency translation rates in the coatings businesses, and by spending for growth initiatives in the titanium dioxide business. Outlook The segment expects to increase sales modestly in 2006, while taking actions to improve profitability. Critical to improving the segment's profitability is the sustainability of price increases to offset higher raw materials and other costs and the successful restoration of full operations at the DeLisle titanium dioxide plant. Industry demand for titanium dioxide is expected to remain strong sustaining continued high capacity utilization. Competitive conditions in the global coatings industry will continue to provide a challenging operating environment in 2006. Modest growth is expected for refinish markets on flat volumes in mature economies while strong growth is expected to continue in emerging markets. Profitability of coatings sold to OEM producers is highly dependent upon volume at specific plants the company services. U.S. and European 2006 automotive builds are expected to be essentially flat with 2005 levels, with moderate growth in Asia Pacific. ELECTRONIC & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2005 $ 3.5 $ 532 2004 3.3 192 2003 2.9 183 Electronic & Communication Technologies provides a broad range of advanced materials for the electronics industry, flexographic printing and color communication systems, and a wide range of fluoropolymer and fluorochemical products.

The segment meets the rapidly changing market needs for smaller, more portable and powerful electronic devices by building on its strength as a leading supplier of organic, flexible, and ceramic circuit materials. Major product lines include DuPont™ Kapton® polyimide film, Pyralux® flexible laminates, Riston® dry film photoresists, Green Tape™ low temperature co-fired ceramics, Fodel® photoimageable composites, and Posistrip® photoresist removers. Electronic & Communication Technologies is the market leader in flexographic printing and color communication serving the packaging and commercial printing industries. Its offerings include DuPont™ Cyrel® and Cyrel®FAST™ flexographic printing 32 systems, as well as color communication systems, including DuPont™ WaterProof®, Cromalin®, and Dylux®. Cyrel®FAST™ is the only solvent-free thermal flexographic platemaking technology commercially available. This technology is helping to offset the continuing decline in the analog proofing technology market. The segment also includes a portfolio of industrial and specialty fluorochemicals and fluoropolymers which are sold into the refrigeration, insulation, aerosol packaging, telecommunications, aerospace, automotive, electronics, chemical processing, and housewares industries. As the largest global manufacturer of fluoroproducts, the company's offerings include DuPont™ Suva® refrigerants, Teflon® and Tefzel® fluoropolymer resins, Autograph® and Teflon® non-stick finishes, and Teflon® and Tedlar® fluoropolymer films. Electronic & Communication Technologies leverages DuPont's strong materials and technology base to target growth opportunities in electronics, fluoropolymers, fluorochemicals, packaging graphics, and color communication. In semiconductor fabrication, packaging, and interconnect, the segment is extending and broadening its portfolio of materials to address critical needs in the industry, e.g., chemical mechanical planarization and embedded passives. In the rapidly growing market for flat panel displays, the segment continues to be a leading materials supplier for plasma displays. In addition, the segment is developing new innovative technologies for liquid crystal displays, such as thermal color filters, while continuing to invest in developing materials technologies for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and field emission displays. In packaging graphics, products such as Cyrel®FAST™ have rapidly grown, solidifying the segment's market leadership position. In fluoropolymers and fluorochemicals, the segment continues to pursue product renewal innovations such as next generation refrigerants, while broadening the scope of applications into high growth areas such as limited combustible cable and photovoltaics. The company's research efforts on long-term growth opportunities such as fuel cells are showing solid technical progress, although commercial applications are not expected to advance for several years. 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $3.5 billion increased about 7 percent, on 6 percent higher USD prices, and a 1 percent improvement in volume. Price improvements reflect higher prices, primarily for fluorochemicals. Higher volumes reflect increased demand primarily for fluoroproducts and electronic materials partly offset by the divestiture of the remaining interest in DuPont Photomasks, Inc. Sales growth was strongest outside the U.S. During the year, approximately 220 new products and product applications were introduced. PTOI in 2005 was $532 million, which included a gain of $48 million on the sale of the company's remaining interest in DuPont Photomasks, Inc. versus $192 million last year. 2004 included net charges of $108 million for PFOA litigation (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and $67 million for employee separation costs and asset impairment charges. Earnings growth in 2005 also resulted from improved pricing, modest demand improvement and continued productivity gains. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $3.3 billion increased 13 percent on 10 percent higher volumes and 3 percent higher USD selling prices. Higher volumes reflect a significant increase in demand for electronic materials, fluoropolymers, and refrigerants. Sales outside the U.S. grew 24 percent with sales in Asia Pacific up 36 percent. PTOI in 2004 was $192 million versus $183 million in 2003. In 2004, PTOI includes net charges of $67 million for employee separation costs and asset impairment charges, and $108 million for PFOA litigation. These charges were offset by earnings improvements resulting principally from higher volumes, productivity improvements, and targeted pricing actions throughout 2004. Outlook In 2006, modest revenue and earnings growth is expected for the segment. Earnings in 2006 will benefit from new product introductions, targeted pricing actions to offset energy related raw material cost increases, and continued focus on fixed cost control. This segment manufactures products that could be affected by uncertainties associated with PFOA. See the discussion on Page 49 under the subheading PFOA. 33 PERFORMANCE MATERIALS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2005 $ 6.8 $ 523 2004 6.6 295 2003 5.4 410 Performance Materials provides customers with more productive, higher performance polymer materials, systems and solutions to improve the uniqueness, functionality and profitability of their product offerings. Performance Materials delivers a broad polymer-based materials product portfolio, including engineering polymers that are primarily used by customers to fabricate components for mechanical and electrical systems, as well as specialized resins and films used in various packaging and industrial applications. These applications include food packaging, sealants and adhesives, sporting goods, and interlayers for laminated safety glass. Key brands include DuPont™ Zytel® nylon resins, Delrin® acetal resins, Hytrel® polyester thermoplastic elastomer resins, Tynex® filaments, Surlyn® resins, SentryGlas® Plus and Butacite® laminate interlayers, Mylar® and Melinex® polyester films, and Viton® fluoroelastomers. The key markets served by the segment include the automotive OEM and associated after-market industries, as well as electrical, electronics, packaging, construction, and consumer durable goods. The segment's core competency is applied materials science, focusing on substituting traditional materials with new materials that offer advantages such as performance, durability, aesthetics, and weight reduction. New applications and processing materials into innovative parts and systems are also areas of focus. A recent example of this core innovation capability is SentryGlas® Expressions™, which links DuPont™ polymer materials with ink jet technologies to develop specialty decorative interlayers for architectural applications. In 2004, the segment expanded its operations in China adding compounding capacity in both Shenzhen and Shanghai, and completed the shutdown of one of its production facilities in the Netherlands, relocating some of the assets to higher growth regions. On June 30, 2005, DuPont completed a transaction with Dow related to DDE, a 50/50 joint venture. Dow acquired from DDE certain assets related to the Engage®, Nordel® and Tyrin® businesses. Upon the completion of this transaction, the remaining elastomers business became a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont and was renamed DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC. For some time, the company had been evaluating both its response to a long-term declining demand for the neoprene products and the anticipated capital investment requirements at the Louisville, Kentucky facility. The company now plans to consolidate production at its upgraded LaPlace, Louisiana, facility by the end of March 2007 at which time neoprene production will cease at the Louisville site. In 2005, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $34 million, reflecting severance and related costs for approximately 275 employees. Annual cost reductions related to ceasing neoprene production at Louisville and consolidating production at LaPlace are expected to offset reduced revenue related to declining demand. Cash payouts of $25 million are largely expected to be paid in 2007 (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these matters). 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $6.8 billion were 2 percent higher than 2004, reflecting 8 percent higher USD selling prices, partly offset by 6 percent lower sales volumes. Sales volumes declined due to the business interruption caused by the hurricanes, the aforementioned change in the elastomers business and exiting the DMT business, pricing actions to improve mix and margins, and lower demand from markets tied to motor vehicle production in the United States and Europe. 34 Excluding sales from the businesses transferred to Dow of $386 million and $536 million from the years 2005 and 2004, respectively, segment sales were up 4 percent, reflecting 8 percent higher USD selling prices and 4 percent lower volume. During 2005, approximately 180 new products and product applications were introduced. PTOI was $523 million compared to $295 million in 2004. 2005 PTOI includes $47 million in operating income related to certain elastomers assets sold and a $25 million gain on the sale of these assets. 2005 PTOI also reflects a charge of $17 million related to hurricane damage and a $34 million charge related to the aforementioned plans for the Louisville and LaPlace sites. In 2005, higher selling prices partly offset substantial increases in raw materials costs and the impact of the hurricanes on supply and production. 2004 PTOI includes $268 million in elastomers antitrust litigation charges (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and $67 million in employee separation activities and asset impairment charges. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $6.6 billion were 23 percent higher than 2003, reflecting 9 percent volume growth driven by strong demand in the automotive, electronics, packaging and construction markets. In addition, 2004 results reflect higher sales of films in Asia Pacific and packaging polymers in Europe, as well as an 8 percentage point benefit from consolidation of DDE in April 2004 and a 6 percent increase in USD selling prices. PTOI was $295 million, down 28 percent from $410 million in 2003. The reduction in earnings reflects, in part, $268 million for elastomers antitrust matters, $67 million for employee separation activities and asset impairment charges, and higher costs for raw materials, principally those derived from oil and natural gas. These cost increases were largely offset by the benefit from higher sales volumes and USD selling prices. Outlook U.S. and European 2006 automotive builds are expected to be essentially flat with 2005 levels, with moderate growth in Asia Pacific. Global packaging market growth is expected to remain at current levels. The residential construction market in North America is expected to soften versus 2005 and it is anticipated that the electrical and electronics markets will continue to improve. Performance Materials expects to overcome the absence of sales related to certain elastomers assets sold and realize continued revenue growth in 2006. PTOI is expected to increase, benefiting from higher revenue, price increases, improved fixed cost performance, and customer-driven innovations for products and processes. The level of earnings improvements in 2006 will depend on offsetting the continued high hydrocarbon related raw materials costs with price increases and further productivity gains. PHARMACEUTICALS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2005 – $ 751 2004 – 681 2003 – 571 On October 1, 2001, DuPont Pharmaceuticals was sold to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. DuPont retained its interest in Cozaar® (losartan potassium) and Hyzaar® (losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide). These AIIA drugs were discovered by DuPont and developed in collaboration with Merck and are used in the treatment of hypertension. The U.S. patents covering the compounds, pharmaceutical formulation and use for the treatment of hypertension, including approval for pediatric use, will expire in 2010. DuPont has exclusively licensed worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights for Cozaar® and Hyzaar® to Merck. Pharmaceuticals receives royalties and net proceeds as outlined in these licenses and related agreements. Merck is responsible for manufacturing, marketing and selling Cozaar® and Hyzaar®. 35 In September 2002, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cozaar® to reduce the rate of progression of nephropathy (kidney disease) in Type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension and nephropathy (hereafter referred to as the RENAAL study). Through 2005, approvals based on the RENAAL study have been granted in 53 countries, with further approvals pending. The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study (LIFE) results were reported and published in March 2002 at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology. The study found that use of Cozaar® significantly reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) compared to the beta-blocker atenolol. In March 2003, the FDA approved Cozaar® as the first and only hypertensive medicine to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and LVH. In total, 62 countries have granted regulatory licenses to Cozaar® based on the LIFE study. In 2005, the FDA approved Hyzaar® to reduce the risk of stroke based on the LIFE study. The FDA granted a new indication for Hyzaar® in 2004 for use in patients with severe hypertension. This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients. In 2005, Hyzaar® 100-12.5 mg tablets were introduced offering a new treatment alternative for doctors with patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by Cozaar® 100 mg alone. Outlook DuPont and Merck continue to support Cozaar® and Hyzaar® with clinical studies designed to identify additional therapeutic benefits for patients with hypertension and co-morbid conditions. The company expects the ongoing Cozaar®/Hyzaar® collaboration to continue to be an important contributor to earnings until the U.S. patents expire in 2010. Thereafter, earnings are expected to decline significantly. SAFETY & PROTECTION Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2005 $ 5.2 $ 980 2004 4.7 837 2003 4.1 805 Safety & Protection satisfies the growing global needs of businesses, governments and consumers for solutions that make life safer. By uniting market-driven science with the strength of highly-regarded brands such as Kevlar®, Tyvek® and Nomex®, Safety & Protection has built a unique presence in the marketplace since its inception in 2002. The segment serves a large number of customers in markets that range from construction, transportation, communications, industrial chemicals, oil, gas, and manufacturing to defense, homeland security, and safety consulting. In addition to serving its existing customer base, the segment is investing in the future by going where the growth is. The segment's growth initiatives are a response to critical needs to help people feel safe at home and at work, to assist the government, military and law enforcement and to preserve and protect the environment. These initiatives include building innovations, personal protection, clean and disinfect, consumer safety, government solutions, environmental solutions, and safety consulting services. Additionally, Safety & Protection works closely with businesses across the company, in areas like automotive safety and food safety, to provide seamless access to products and technology. 36 In 2005, Safety & Protection continued to integrate its products to better meet the needs of the construction industry. This approach brings together brands such as Corian® and Zodiaq® with new applications in Tyvek®, Kevlar® and SentryGlas® to improve building interiors and building envelope systems. Safety & Protection assembled an integrated systems approach to help protect the global food supply in the event of an avian flu pandemic. The multi-level approach includes special protective apparel, clean and disinfect chemicals and safety management solutions. The segment's aramid fiber materials helped launch the world's largest commercial jetliner, the Airbus A380. A host of the company's products, including Kevlar® and Nomex®, provided weight savings, strength, and durability as well as helped meet stringent safety standards. Kevlar®, Nomex® and Tyvek® continue to hold strong positions in the personal and life protection markets due to the strong demand for military body armor and for personal protective gear in the oil & gas industry and in emerging regions. Refinery solutions offerings experienced growth in 2005 and successfully started up its first unit providing on-site sulfuric acid regeneration service. Current offerings to the government include secure environmental treatment systems, use of SentryGlas® Plus interlayers in bomb-blast resistant windows, use of Tyvek® HomeWrap™ and Corian® for military housing, and expanded use of Kevlar® focusing on military ballistic, vehicle uparmoring and other applications. An ongoing concern with homeland security continues to benefit the segment with increased orders for emergency response, military, law enforcement and firefighting apparel. Global demand for products that prevent disease and improve productivity in the food, health care and industrial markets continue to create growth opportunities for the segment's clean and disinfect offerings. Safety & Protection led efforts to improve workplace safety through its consulting services, which experienced growth in all regions. One important initiative was the DuPont-inspired World Safety Declaration, the first-ever agreement by industry to improve workplace safety globally. 2005 versus 2004 Sales of $5.2 billion were up 11 percent, due to 6 percent higher selling prices and 5 percent higher volumes. The segment's aramids fibers and safety consulting offerings primarily drove revenue growth. Segment sales were negatively affected during the last four months of the year by the hurricanes, particularly in the aniline and acrylonitrile product lines. The Latin America and Asia Pacific regions experienced higher-than-average sales growth in 2005. During the year, approximately 200 new products and product applications were introduced. PTOI in 2005 was $980 million, up 17 percent from $837 million in the prior year. 2005 includes a charge of $27 million related to hurricane costs and a $31 million gain from the sale of a non-core asset. This net benefit, along with strong earnings growth from aramid fibers and safety consulting helped increase the segment's PTOI. Pricing momentum continued within the segment during 2005, but was offset by higher raw material and transportation costs. 2004 includes charges of $70 million for employee separation activities and the impairment of certain European manufacturing assets. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $4.7 billion were up 15 percent, due in part to 8 percent higher USD selling prices, largely reflecting the pass-through of higher aniline and other raw material costs via supply contracts. In addition, sales growth reflects 6 percent higher volumes and a 1 percent benefit from small acquisitions. Volume growth was primarily driven by greater worldwide sales of Kevlar® and Nomex® aramids for new and existing applications. Sales of Tyvek® nonwovens and solid surface products experienced double-digit growth, resulting from the strong construction market worldwide. PTOI in 2004 was $837 million, up 4 percent from $805 million in the prior year. 2004 includes charges of $70 million for employee separation activities and the impairment of certain European manufacturing assets. These charges were more than offset by improvements resulting from higher volumes and the weaker USD. Higher local selling prices were offset by the negative effect of higher raw material costs and ongoing investment and growth. 37 Outlook Safety & Protection will continue to drive growth in its product lines globally with the strength of its brands. U.S. and global demand for aramids is expected to remain strong. Continued U.S. and local level homeland security funding is expected during 2006 and will support growth in personal protective systems. The construction, personal protection, medical packaging and medical fabrics market segments are expected to grow during the year. Margins are likely to be pressured by energy and transportation related costs and competition. Overall, Safety & Protection expects continued revenue growth and moderate earnings growth in 2006 based on continued market penetration, the introduction of new products and technologies, and continued investment in its growth initiatives. This segment manufactures products that could be affected by uncertainties associated with PFOA. See the discussion on Page 49 under the subheading PFOA. TEXTILES & INTERIORS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2005 N/A N/A 2004 $ 3.3 $ (515 ) 2003 6.9 (1,892 ) On April 30, 2004, the company sold INVISTA to Koch for $3,844 million, except for the transfer of certain equity affiliates. Additional details regarding Textiles & Interiors are contained in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2005, financial transactions related to the remaining assets of Textiles & Interiors are reported in Other. 2004 versus 2003 Sales of $3.3 billion were 53 percent lower than the prior year, principally due to the sale of INVISTA on April 30, 2004. PTOI was a loss of $515 million in 2004, including $667 million in separation charges. 2003 PTOI was a loss of $1,892 million primarily associated with the planned separation of INVISTA. OTHER The company combines the results of its developmental and nonaligned businesses under Other. Developmental businesses include bio-based materials and other growth initiatives. Bio-based materials develops and commercializes novel materials with superior functionality that offer significant growth potential. DuPont partnered with Tate & Lyle PLC to produce Bio-PDO™, the key building block for DuPont™ Sorona® polymer, using a proprietary fermentation and purification process based on corn sugar. This bio-based method uses less energy, reduces emissions and employs renewable resources in contrast to traditional petrochemical processes. The first commercial-scale plant to manufacture Bio-PDO™ is planned to begin production in 2006. Research and development focuses on developing high-performance bio-based materials to target long-term growth opportunities. Nonaligned businesses includes 2005 activities related to the remaining assets of Textiles & Interiors, and costs associated with Benlate® fungicide and other discontinued businesses. In the aggregate, sales in Other for 2005, 2004 and 2003 represent less than one percent of total segment sales. 2005 pretax losses were $78 million compared to a loss of $242 million in 2004. The improvement in 2005 reflects a net gain of $62 million relating to the disposition of four equity affiliates. The 2004 loss includes $94 million for employee separation activities, a $29 million charge to write off abandoned technology, and a $20 million benefit from insurance proceeds related to Benlate® litigation. 38 2004 PTOI was a loss of $242 million versus a loss of $220 million in 2003. The 2004 loss includes $94 million for employee separation activities, a $29 million charge to write off abandoned technology, and a $20 million benefit from insurance proceeds related to Benlate® litigation. The 2003 loss includes $78 million in charges associated with Benlate® litigation net of insurance proceeds. Liquidity & Capital Resources The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of independent sources, including: Cash provided by operating activities, Cash and cash equivalents, Marketable debt securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets, and asset sales. The company's relatively low long-term borrowing level, strong financial position and credit ratings provide excellent access to these markets. In October 2005, Standard & Poor's (S&P), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded the company's long-term debt credit rating following the company's announced $5 billion share buyback program. The company's management expected this revision and believes that it will have a minimal impact on the company's borrowing costs and ability to access capital markets. The credit rating agencies left the company's short-term credit ratings at or near the highest rating levels. The company's long term (LT) and short term (ST) rating history at year end over the last three years follows: 2005 LT/ST/Outlook 2004 LT/ST/Outlook 2003 LT/ST/Outlook S&P A/A-1/Stable AA-/A-1+/Negative AA-/A-1+/Negative Moody's A2/P-1/Negative Aa3/P-1/Stable Aa3/P-1/Stable Fitch A/F1/Stable AA-/F1+/Stable Not Rated The company's liquidity, financial position and flexibility remain strong and management considers this strength to be a competitive advantage. This advantage is based on strong business operating cash flows over an economic cycle, and a commitment to cash discipline regarding working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. Pursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first, to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable debt securities balances of $1.9 billion and bank credit lines of $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2005, provide primary liquidity to support all short-term obligations. Secondary liquidity, sufficient to meet upcoming debt maturities, comes from excellent access to capital markets, strong cash flow generation and the ability to sell assets. Management believes that the company's ability to generate cash and access the capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments and other cash needs for the foreseeable future. In the unlikely event that the company would not be able to meet its short-term liquidity needs, the company has access to approximately $3.5 billion in ""same day"" credit lines with several major financial institutions. These credit lines are primarily multi-year facilities. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided by Operating Activities $ 2,542 $ 3,231 $ 2,589 The company's Cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion in 2005, a $700 million decrease from the $3.2 billion generated in 2004. The year-over-year decrease principally reflects higher contributions to pension plans, primarily a $1 billion contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan. Changes in accounts receivable and inventories were modest. Working capital productivity measures of days sales outstanding, inventory days supply and days payable outstanding in 2005 were essentially flat versus 2004. 39 The company's Cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in 2004, a $600 million increase from the $2.6 billion generated in 2003. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher earnings in 2004. Cash provided by operations in 2003 was adversely impacted by an increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the termination of the company's accounts receivable securitization program. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash (used for) provided by Investing Activities $ (602 ) $ 1,936 $ (3,375 ) In 2005, cash was used for investing activities totaling $602 million compared to investing activities that provided cash of $1.9 billion in 2004. The primary difference was related to proceeds from the sale of assets, which were $312 million in 2005 compared to $3,908 million in 2004, the latter related principally to the sale of INVISTA (see Notes 5 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, in 2005, the settlement of forward exchange contracts issued to hedge the company's net exposure, by currency, related to monetary assets and liabilities resulted in the receipt of $653 million versus cash payments of $509 million in 2004. The cash inflow in 2005 was primarily related to the stronger USD while the payments in 2004 were primarily attributable to the weaker USD. These settlements were largely offset by revaluations of the items being hedged, which are reflected in the appropriate categories in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Purchases of plant, property and equipment in 2005 totaled $1.3 billion, including $70 million to replace plant assets destroyed by the hurricanes. Cash flows totaling $1.9 billion were provided by investing activities in 2004 as compared to cash used for investing activities in 2003. In 2004, proceeds from the sale of INVISTA were $3,840 million. These proceeds were partly offset by cash payments associated with the settlement of forward currency exchange contracts of $509 million and purchases of plant, property and equipment of $1.2 billion. Payments for businesses acquired in 2003 totaled $1.5 billion, primarily consisting of two acquisitions. In June and July 2003, the company acquired 66,704,465 shares in DuPont Canada from the minority owners for $1.1 billion. In May 2003, The Solae Company, a majority-owned subsidiary of the company, acquired 82 percent of Bunge Limited's Brazilian ingredients operation for $256 million, with the additional 18 percent acquired in the fourth quarter of 2003 for $44 million. In addition, in 2003, payments associated with the settlement of foreign exchange contracts were $631 million and purchases of plant, property and equipment were $1.7 billion (including $334 million of synthetic leases.) The company expects 2006 purchases of plant, property and equipment to be between $1.4 and $1.6 billion, which includes $90 million for hurricane related capital expenditures. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash (used for) provided by Financing Activities $ (2,851 ) $ (5,550 ) $ 31 Changes in cash flows related to financing activities are principally related to the company's use of commercial paper and debt, the payment of dividends and share repurchase activity. Total debt at December 31, 2005, was $8.2 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from December 31, 2004, primarily due to new borrowings to support the AJCA cash repatriation program and the $1 billion contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan, partially offset by repayments. Total debt at December 31, 2004 was $6.5 billion, a decrease of $3.7 billion from December 31, 2003, primarily due to the use of proceeds from the sale of INVISTA to pay down commercial paper. Also, $255 million of the company's debt was assumed by Koch in the sale of INVISTA. At December 31, the company's commercial paper balance was $0, $584 million, and $4.4 billion for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition to changes in the level of debt, the mix of the company's debt also changed. Commercial paper decreased $3.8 billion in 2004 over 2003 and in 2004 the company issued $1.4 billion of six- and ten-year notes. These notes essentially refinanced the $1.3 billion of maturing long-term notes due in 2004 and extended the company's maturity profile. 40 Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.4 billion in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.46 in 2005 and $1.40 in both 2004 and 2003. The common dividend declared in the first quarter 2006 was the company's 406th consecutive dividend since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904. The company's Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share buyback plan in June 2001. During 2005, the company purchased 9.9 million shares at a cost of $505 million against this program, bringing the cumulative purchases against this program to 20.5 million shares at a cost of $962 million. Management expects to continue purchasing stock under this buyback plan to offset dilution from shares issued under employee compensation plans. However, management has not established a timeline for the buyback of the remaining stock under this program. In addition to the 2001 plan, in October 2005 the Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan. On October 27, 2005, the company repurchased 75.7 million shares of DuPont's outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.0 billion from Goldman Sachs under an accelerated share repurchase agreement, which is discussed in ""Certain Derivative Instruments"" under ""Off Balance Sheet Arrangements."" The company intends to execute the remaining $2 billion repurchase over the 12 months following the completion of the Accelerated Share Repurchase program in mid-2006, consistent with the company's cash discipline policy. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of shares activity. In 2003, the company redeemed two minority interest structures for $2 billion and recorded a charge of $28 million primarily to write off the remaining unamortized costs associated with the transactions. These structures had been established in 2001 and the associated costs were being amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES Cash and cash equivalents, and Marketable debt securities totaled $1.9 billion, $3.5 billion, and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The $1.6 billion decrease in cash from 2004 to 2005 was due mainly to the $3 billion share buyback and debt pay down partially offset by new borrowings to fund the repatriation of $9.1 billion under AJCA and positive net cash flow in several regions. The $200 million increase in cash from 2003 to 2004 was due mainly to proceeds from sale of INVISTA almost entirely offset by debt repayments. NET DEBT At December 31, 2005, net debt was $6.3 billion compared to $2.9 billion and $7.1 billion at year-end 2004 and 2003, respectively. The company defines net debt as total debt less Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable debt securities. Management believes that net debt is meaningful because it provides the investor with a more holistic view of the company's liquidity and debt position since the company's cash balance is available to meet operating and capital needs, as well as to provide liquidity around the world. Net debt also allows the investor to more easily compare cash flow between periods without adjusting for changes in cash and debt. 41 The following table reconciles the differences from Total debt to net debt: (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Commercial paper – $584 $4,422 Long-term debt due in one year $ 986 167 1,262 Other short-term debt 411 185 230 Total short-term debt 1,397 936 5,914 Long-term debt 6,783 5,548 4,301 Borrowings and capital leases held for sale – 1 264 Total debt $ 8,180 $ 6,485 $ 10,479 Cash and cash equivalents held for sale – – 75 Cash and cash equivalents 1,736 3,369 3,273 Marketable debt securities 115 167 25 Net debt $ 6,329 $2,949 $7,106 The following table summarizes changes in net debt throughout 2005, 2004 and 2003: (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net debt–beginning of year $ 2,949 $ 7,106 $ 2,689 Cash provided by continuing operations (2,542 ) (3,231 ) (2,589 ) Purchases of property, plant & equipment and investments in affiliates 1,406 1,298 1,784 Net payments for businesses acquired 206 119 1,527 Proceeds from sales of assets (312 ) (68 ) (17 ) Proceeds from sale of assets–Textiles & Interiors, net of cash sold – (3,840 ) – Debt assumed by Koch – (255 ) – Forward exchange contract settlements (653 ) 509 631 Dividends paid to stockholders 1,439 1,404 1,407 Acquisition of treasury stock 3,530 457 – Redemption of corporate minority interest structures – – 2,037 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 722 (404 ) (425 ) Other (416 ) (146 ) 62 Increase (decrease) in net debt 3,380 (4,157 ) 4,417 Net debt–end of year $ 6,329 $ 2,949 $ 7,106 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS CERTAIN GUARANTEE CONTRACTS Indemnifications The company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, and related business activities prior to the completion of the transactions. The terms of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and product liabilities, are generally indefinite. In addition, the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, against liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the company, such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters. If the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party. The maximum amount of potential 42 future payments is generally indeterminable. The carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 is $103 million and $99 million, respectively. Although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued, due to the nature of indemnified items, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist. In connection with the sale of INVISTA, the company indemnified Koch against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal and environmental matters, and other representations and warranties. The estimated fair value of these obligations of $70 million is included in the indemnifications balance of $103 million at December 31, 2005. The fair value was based on management's best estimate of the value expected to be required to issue the indemnifications in a stand-alone, arm's length transaction with an unrelated party and, where appropriate, by the utilization of probability-weighted discounted net cash flow models. The company does not believe that these indemnities will have a material impact on the future liquidity of the company (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Obligations for Equity Affiliates and Others The company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates, customers, suppliers and other unaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2005, the company had directly guaranteed $586 million of such obligations, plus $288 million relating to guarantees of obligations for divested subsidiaries and affiliates. This represents the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees. The company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2005, the liabilities recorded for these obligations were not material. Existing guarantees for customers and suppliers arose as part of contractual agreements. Existing guarantees for equity affiliates arose for liquidity needs in normal operations. In certain cases, the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers. The company has historically guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities related to divested subsidiaries including Conoco and its subsidiaries and affiliates, INVISTA entities sold to Koch, and Consolidation Coal Sales Company. The Restructuring, Transfer and Separation Agreement between DuPont and Conoco requires Conoco to use its best efforts to have Conoco, or any of its subsidiaries, substitute for DuPont. Conoco, Koch and Consolidation Coal Sales Company have indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2005, the company has no liabilities recorded for these obligations. Additional information with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees should unforeseen circumstances arise. CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS During 2005, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman Sachs) under which the company agreed to repurchase from Goldman Sachs shares of DuPont's outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3,025 million. Under the agreement, the company purchased and retired 75,719,334 shares of DuPont's common stock on October 27, 2005, at a price per share of $39.62 with Goldman Sachs purchasing an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the nine-month period ending July 27, 2006. At the end of the nine-month period, the company may receive from, or be required to pay to, Goldman Sachs a price adjustment that may be settled, at the company's option, in cash or shares of its common stock. The price adjustment is based 43 upon the difference between the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of DuPont common stock during the nine-month purchase period and $39.62, multiplied by the number of shares purchased by Goldman Sachs. If the VWAP is less than $39.62, then Goldman Sachs will owe an adjustment to the company; conversely if the VWAP exceeds $39.62, the company will owe Goldman Sachs. Through December 31, 2005, Goldman Sachs had purchased 18,124,335 shares with a VWAP of $42.77. If Goldman Sachs purchased the remaining 57,594,999 shares at the December 30, 2005 closing price of $42.50, then the company would owe Goldman Sachs a price adjustment of $223 million upon settlement, payable in cash or shares of the company's common stock. The repurchase agreement caps the number of shares that could be required to be issued at 75,000,000. The forward contract for the price adjustment is accounted for as an equity instrument and changes in its fair value are not recorded during the contract period. Upon settlement in cash or shares, the price adjustment will be recorded as equity. SYNTHETIC LEASES At December 31, 2005, the company has one synthetic lease program relating to miscellaneous short-lived equipment valued at approximately $115 million. Lease payments for these assets totaled $51 million in 2005, $54 million in 2004 and $43 million in 2003, and were reported as operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. The leases under this program are considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Furthermore, the lease payments associated with this program vary based on one month LIBOR. The company may terminate the program at any time by purchasing the assets. Should the company decide neither to renew the leases nor to exercise its purchase option, it must pay the owner a residual value guarantee amount, which may be recovered from a sale of the property to a third party. Residual value guarantees totaled $100 million at December 31, 2005. During 2003, the company purchased the assets under its synthetic leases related to manufacturing and warehousing facilities under construction for $210 million. 44 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Information related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Payments Due In Total at December 31, 2005 2006 2007-2008 2009-2010 2011 and beyond Long-term and short-term debt 1 $ 7,752 $ 986 $ 2,634 $ 2,448 $ 1,684 Capital leases 1 19 2 7 6 4 Operating leases 805 276 273 153 103 Purchase obligations 2 Information technology infrastructure & services 158 45 74 25 14 Raw material obligations 597 415 111 41 30 Research & development agreements 42 27 12 2 1 Utility obligations 317 146 74 26 71 INVISTA-related obligations 3 798 142 286 195 175 Human resource services 415 17 90 94 214 Other 4 47 42 2 2 1 Total purchase obligations 2,374 834 649 385 506 Other long-term liabilities 1,5 Workers' compensation 66 17 27 10 12 Asset retirement obligations 58 4 22 22 10 Environmental remediation 343 77 114 114 38 Legal settlements 101 32 39 30 – Other 6 124 18 21 14 71 Total other long-term liabilities 692 148 223 190 131 Total contractual obligations $ 11,642 $ 2,246 $ 3,786 $ 3,182 $ 2,428 1Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement. 3Includes raw material supply obligations of $619 million and contract manufacturing obligations of $179 million. 4Primarily represents obligations associated with distribution, health care/benefit administration, and other professional and consulting contracts. 5Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have been excluded from the table as they are discussed below within Long-Term Employee Benefits. 6Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other postretirement benefits. The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations should unforeseen circumstances arise. Long-Term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, and medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors. About 83 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions, and essentially all of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits are attributable to the benefit plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension and medical, dental and life insurance benefits. Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on 45 years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. By law, no contributions are currently required to be made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2006 and no contributions are currently anticipated. The company will monitor the pension funding legislation in the U.S., but the company does not anticipate it will have a material near term impact on required or voluntary contributions. Contributions beyond 2006 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, reduced asset valuations tend to result in higher contributions to pension plans. In 2005, the company contributed $1,253 million to its pension plans, including $1,000 million to its principal U.S. pension plan. The company anticipates that it will make approximately $280 million in contributions in 2006 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan. GAAP requires the full reflection of the amount of pension under-funding, if any, defined as the amount of the accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the amount of pension assets as of the measurement date. To the extent this amount has not already been fully reflected, the company is required to reflect an additional minimum pension liability, and any adjustment is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income in Stockholders' equity. For this purpose, each of the company's pension plans must be tested individually. At year-end 2002, a non-cash after-tax charge of $2.5 billion to Stockholders' equity was recorded in response to lower asset valuations and somewhat higher benefit obligations as of that date. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, $27 million, $1,245 million and $858 million, respectively, of this charge was reversed, reflecting the net effect of recovering asset values, company contributions, and changes in discount rates. Medical, dental and life insurance plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pretax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $395 million, $435 million, and $410 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $350 million in 2006. Changes in cash requirements during this period reflect higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles. In addition, lower cash requirements for 2006 reflect the commencement of the government sponsored prescription drug coverage under the U.S. medical program. The company's income can be significantly affected by pension benefits as well as retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last three years was affected by pretax charges and credits related to long-term employee benefits. Pretax (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Pension charges $ 432 $ 997 $ 554 Other postretirement benefit charges (credits) 218 (241 ) 290 Net charge $ 650 $ 756 $ 844 The decrease in 2005 pension cost is primarily attributable to the absence of $446 million net settlement and curtailment charges recorded in 2004 in connection with the sale of INVISTA. In addition, the lower expense in 2005 reflects favorable 46 returns on pension assets, higher contributions to pension plans and changes in discount rates. The increase in 2005 other benefit expenses principally reflects the absence of $436 million curtailment gains recognized in 2004 in connection with the sale of INVISTA. The company's key assumptions used in calculating its long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases, and the discount rate (see Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Effective for the 2005 Consolidated Financial Statements, the company updated the mortality tables used for most U.S. plans. The impact of the change in mortality tables and lower discount rates were more than offset by the effects of favorable investment and other economic experience under these plans. For 2006, these factors are expected to result in a reduction in pension and other postretirement benefit pretax expenses of about $250 million. Environmental Matters DuPont operates global manufacturing facilities, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, DuPont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, eliminate the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of waste water discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future. While these costs may increase in the future, they are not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Pretax environmental expenses charged to current operations totaled $468 million in 2005 compared with $455 million in 2004 and $482 million in 2003. These expenses include the remediation accruals discussed below; operating, maintenance and depreciation costs for solid waste, air and water pollution control facilities, and the costs of environmental research activities. While expenses related to the costs of environmental research activities are not a significant component of the company's overall environmental expenses, the company expects these costs to become proportionally greater as the company increases its participation in businesses for which environmental assessments are required during product development. The largest of the environmental expenses in 2005 was $107 million for the operation of water pollution control facilities and $124 million for solid waste management. About 78 percent of total annual environmental expenses resulted from operations in the U.S. In 2005, DuPont spent approximately $67 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects will total $162 million in 2006. In the U.S., significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the CAA. Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures. Total CAA capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from $40 million to $70 million. The EPA challenged the U.S. chemical industry to voluntarily conduct screening level health and environmental effects testing on nearly 3,000 high production volume (HPV) chemicals or to make equivalent information publicly available. An HPV chemical is a chemical listed on the 1990 Inventory Update Rule with annual U.S. cumulative production and imports of one million pounds or more. Since 2001, the company has spent an estimated $3 million on HPV testing and estimates it will spend another $0.5 million to complete the original HPV testing program. An extended HPV program has been initiated by the American Chemistry Council in which DuPont has agreed to sponsor an additional eleven new HPV chemicals listed on the 2002 Inventory Update Rule. Since 2000, the entire chemical industry has spent an estimated $250 million on HPV testing. 47 Global climate change is being addressed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Convention) adopted in 1992. The Kyoto Protocol (the Protocol), adopted in December 1997, is an effort to establish short-term actions under the Convention. The Protocol entered into force in February 2005 in most countries in which DuPont operates. The U.S. has declined to ratify the Protocol. The European Union (EU) has already begun a program to reduce emissions that includes an emissions trading system linked to the Protocol. The U.S. continues to pursue a less-restrictive climate policy framework, emphasizing voluntary action. The Protocol establishes significant emission reduction targets for six gases considered to have global warming potential and is driving mandatory reductions in developed nations outside the U.S. DuPont has a stake in a number of these gases-CO2, HFCs and PFCs-and has been reducing its emissions of these gases since 1991. DuPont remains well ahead of the target and timetable of the Protocol. However, the company faces the possibility of country-specific restrictions in several countries where major reductions have not yet been achieved. High energy prices in Europe and the U.S. in recent years are also due, at least in part, to expectations of emission reduction mandates and the impact of European climate change policies. DuPont is participating in emissions trading in the EU and elsewhere that could aid in satisfying such country-specific requirements. Emission reduction mandates within the U.S. are not expected in the near future, although Congressional proposals for such mandates have been introduced and a number of states are pursuing state-level programs. DuPont has discovered that very low levels of dioxins (parts per trillion to low parts per billion) and related compounds are inadvertently generated during its titanium dioxide pigment production process. The company has launched an extensive research and process engineering development program to identify the cause of the dioxin generation and to identify process modifications that will eliminate dioxin formation. The programs implemented to date have resulted in reductions of almost 50 percent, significant progress against DuPont's aggressive goals to reduce such dioxin generation by 90 percent by 2007. Over 99 percent of the dioxin generated at DuPont's production plants becomes associated with process solid wastes that are disposed in controlled landfills where public exposure is negligible. REMEDIATION EXPENDITURES The RCRA extensively regulates and requires permits for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination at the facility. If conditions warrant, companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, the costs of the RCRA corrective action program are typically borne solely by the company. The company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required over the next two decades. Annual expenditures for the near term, however, are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. The company's expenditures associated with RCRA and similar remediation activities were approximately $49 million in 2005, $43 million in 2004, and $38 million in 2003. The company, from time to time, receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a PRP under CERCLA or similar state statutes. CERCLA is often referred to as the Superfund and requires companies to undertake certain investigative and research activities at sites where it conducts or once conducted operations or where company generated waste has been disposed. The company has also, on occasion, been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company's past operations. As of December 31, 2005, the company had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA or state laws at 384 sites around the U.S., with active remediation under way at 139 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at 144 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose 48 waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at 10 new sites during 2005 compared with four similar notices in 2004, and five in 2003. The company's expenditures associated with CERCLA and similar state remediation activities were approximately $27 million in 2005, $27 million in 2004, and $22 million in 2003. For nearly all Superfund sites, the company's potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other PRPs is relatively low. Other PRPs at sites where the company is a party typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and, where they do not, or where PRPs cannot be located, the company's own share of liability has not materially increased. There are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant, and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites, and at all CERCLA sites in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Total expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws were $79 million in 2005, $74 million in 2004, and $60 million in 2003. REMEDIATION ACCRUALS At December 31, 2005, the Consolidated Balance Sheets included an accrued liability of $343 million compared to $359 million at year-end 2004. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2005. Of the $343 million accrued liability, approximately 12 percent was reserved for non-U.S. facilities. Approximately 63 percent of the reserve balance was attributable to RCRA and similar remediation liabilities, while 25 percent was attributable to CERCLA liabilities. Remediation accruals of $64 million, $58 million and $47 million were added to the reserve in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, nearly $5 million of remediation liabilities were transferred to Koch as part of the sale of INVISTA. PFOA DuPont manufactures fluoropolymer resins and dispersions as well as fluorotelomers, marketing many of them under the Teflon® and Zonyl® brands. The fluoropolymer resin and dispersion businesses are part of the Electronic & Communication Technologies segment; the fluorotelomers business is part of the Safety & Protection segment. Fluoropolymer resins and dispersions are high-performance materials with many end uses including architectural fabrics, telecommunications and electronic wiring insulation, automotive fuel systems, computer chip processing equipment, weather-resistant/breathable apparel and nonstick cookware. Fluorotelomers are used to make soil, stain and grease repellants for paper, apparel, upholstery and carpets as well as firefighting foams and coatings. A form of PFOA is used as a processing agent to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. For over 50 years, DuPont purchased its PFOA needs from a third party, but beginning in the fall of 2002, it began producing PFOA to support the manufacture of fluorpolymer resins and dispersions. PFOA is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC uses PFOA in its manufacture of Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer parts and certain fluoroelastomers marketed under the Viton® trademark. As a result of a series of agreements with Dow, DuPont became the sole owner of DuPont Dow Elastomers, LLC on June 30, 2005. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The wholly owned subsidiary has been renamed DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC and is a part of the Performance Materials segment. 49 PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. As a result, the EPA initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources of PFOA in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to PFOA is occurring. In 2003, the EPA issued a preliminary risk assessment on PFOA that focuses on the exposure of the U.S. general population to PFOA and possible health effects, including developmental toxicity concerns. On January 12, 2005, the EPA issued a draft risk assessment on PFOA. The draft stated that cancer data for PFOA may be best described as ""suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential"" under the EPA's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. Under the Guidelines, the descriptor ""suggestive"" is typically applied to agents if animal testing finds any evidence that exposure causes tumors in one species of animal. The EPA requested that the Science Advisory Board (SAB) review and comment on the scientific soundness of this assessment. On January 30, 2006, the SAB issued a draft report that disagreed with the EPA's draft risk assessment which had described the cancer data as ""suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity."" The predominant SAB view was that the experimental weight of evidence regarding human carcinogenic potential of PFOA was more consistent with the EPA's descriptor of ""likely to be carcinogenic"" as defined in the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. Under the Guidelines this description is typically applied to agents that have tested positive in more than one species, sex, strain, site or exposure route with or without evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. A few SAB members did not find the weight of evidence sufficient to support the ""likely"" descriptor and agreed with EPA's ""suggestive"" descriptor. DuPont disputes the cancer classification recommended in the SAB draft report because it is based on laboratory studies in rats, and does not adequately reflect human health data which to date demonstrates no increase in cancer rates known to be associated with PFOA. The EPA has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks associated with PFOA. The EPA has also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any consumer or industrial related products that contain PFOA. Currently, PFOA is not regulated by the EPA and there are no regulatory actions pending that would prohibit its production or use. However, there can be no assurance that the EPA or any other regulatory entity will not in the future choose to regulate or prohibit the production or use of PFOA. Products currently manufactured by the company representing approximately $1 billion of 2005 revenues could be affected by any such regulation or prohibition. DuPont respects the EPA's position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of PFOA and DuPont, as well as other companies, have outlined plans for continued research, emission reduction activities, and product stewardship activities to help address the EPA's questions. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to the EPA's 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors, and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors, and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. Key elements of the DuPont commitment to EPA include reducing global emissions from manufacturing facilities by 98 percent by 2007 (which incorporates the substantial achievement of 90 percent reduction already realized through DuPont's ongoing reduction program); establishing emission caps for U.S. facilities to limit the absolute number of pounds of PFOA emitted; implementing product caps for PFOA in fluoropolymer dispersions by 2007; and, by 2010, reducing PFOA content and any residual impurities in fluorotelomer products that could break down to PFOA. 50 In addition, DuPont will work individually and with others in the industry to inform EPA's regulatory counterparts in the European Union, Canada, China and Japan about these activities and PFOA in general, including emissions reductions from DuPont's facilities as well as reformulation of the company's fluoropolymer dispersions. DuPont has developed technology that can reduce the PFOA content in fluoropolymer dispersions by 97 percent. DuPont is offering the technology to fluoropolymer manufacturers globally on a royalty-free basis. Based on existing scientific data, DuPont believes that PFOA exposure at the levels observed does not pose any health risk to the general public. To date no human health effects are known to be caused by PFOA, even in workers who have significantly higher exposure levels than the general population. DuPont is conducting a two-phase employee health study on PFOA for more than 1,000 workers at its Washington Works site located near Parkersburg, W.Va. Results from the first phase of this study indicate no association between exposure to PFOA and most of the health parameters that were measured. The only potentially relevant association is a modest increase in some, but not all, lipid fractions, e.g. cholesterol, in some of the highest exposed workers. It is unclear if this association is caused by PFOA exposure or is related to some other variable; therefore, DuPont is consulting with medical and other scientific experts to design and conduct appropriate follow-up testing. The second phase is a mortality study that involves the examination of all causes of death in employees who worked at the Washington Works site during its more than fifty years of operation. DuPont has established reserves in connection with certain PFOA litigation matters. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments DERIVATIVES AND OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Under procedures and controls established by the company's Financial Risk Management Framework, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions, petrochemical and petroleum companies, and exchanges. The company hedges certain business-specific foreign currency exposures as well as foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. In addition, the company enters into exchange traded agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge exposures relevant to agricultural feedstock purchases. In January 2004, the company terminated its broad-based foreign currency revenue hedging program, as well as its program to hedge natural gas purchases. All outstanding foreign currency and natural gas hedging positions related to these programs expired during 2004. In October 2005, the company authorized the use of financial derivatives to hedge exposure to price fluctuations for certain energy feedstock purchases. However, at December 31, 2005, the company had not entered into any derivative instruments with respect to this program. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments, accounts receivable and derivatives. 51 As part of the company's risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont, and monitors actual exposures versus established limits on a daily basis. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, derivatives, and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed, and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. As of December 31, 2005, no one individual customer balance represents more than 5 percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses. The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The company's objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes. Accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, commitments and cash flows. The company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are minimized. The following table summarizes the impacts of this program on the company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Pretax exchange gain/(loss) $ 445 $ (411 ) $ (190 ) Tax (expense)/benefit (483 ) 360 187 After-tax loss $ (38 ) $ (51 ) $ (3 ) This table includes the company's pro rata share of its equity affiliates' exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on forward exchange contracts. In addition, option and forward exchange contracts are used to hedge a portion of certain anticipated foreign currency raw material purchases from vendors outside of the U.S. gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the related foreign currency-denominated costs. From time to time, the company will enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and 52 economic trends. Forward exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements and to place foreign currency deposits and marketable securities investments. INTEREST RATE RISK The company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on three- or six-month USD LIBOR. Interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. COMMODITY PRICE RISK The company enters into over-the counter and exchange-traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. The company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory. Under these contracts, growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the market price of grain for a period of time following harvest. Derivative instruments, such as commodity futures that have a high correlation to the underlying commodity, are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers. The company utilizes agricultural commodity futures to manage the price volatility of soybean meal. These derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk. Additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. VALUE AT RISK A Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis provides a forward-looking perspective of the maximum potential loss in fair value for a defined period of time assuming normal market conditions and a given confidence level. The company's risk management portfolio consists of a variety of hedging instruments which provide protection from volatility in the areas of interest rates, foreign currency, agricultural commodities, and energy feedstock commodities. The valuations and risk calculations for the VaR analysis were conducted using the company's risk management portfolios as of December 31, 2005, and 2004. The average, high and low values reflected in the table were developed from each of the four quarters ended in 2005. The VaR analysis used a Monte Carlo simulation type model with a covariance matrix, and employed 3,000 pseudo-random market paths including all risk factors associated with the hedging instruments in the company's risk management portfolios. The calculations were conducted over a 20 business day period at a 95 percent confidence level. The following table details the results of the VaR analysis for each significant risk management portfolio at the end of both 2005 and 2004. VaR for the entire risk management portfolio is a loss of $70 million for 2005, and a loss of $150 million for 2004; these values reflect the diversification benefits and covariance correlation of the total portfolio. 2005 (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Average High Low Foreign currency $ (43 ) $ (191 ) $ (218 ) $ (296 ) $ (43 ) Interest rates (34 ) (61 ) (38 ) (46 ) (34 ) Agricultural commodities (17 ) (23 ) (10 ) (17 ) (6 ) 53 The table above represents the VaR potential loss in fair value when each risk management portfolio is valued individually. The changes in portfolio VaRs in 2005 as compared to 2004 are due to changes in portfolio size, price volatility and, for interest rates, higher short-term rates and a flatter yield curve. The VaR model results are only an estimate and are not intended to forecast actual losses that may be incurred in future periods. Since the company's risk management programs are highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposures.",2023-12-30 21:51:49.941248

All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company's strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures and financial results are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events. The company cannot guarantee that these assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. For some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 6. Overview Vision DuPont's vision is to be the world's most dynamic science company, creating sustainable solutions essential for a better, healthier, and safer life for people everywhere. The company is committed to growing shareholder and societal value while reducing its environmental footprint over the long term. Strategy Underlying the company's strategy for growth are four significant global trends – Increasing Food Production, Decreasing Dependency on Fossil Fuels, Protecting People, Assets and the Environment, and Growth in Emerging Markets. The company believes it best serves its shareholders by increasing its global presence in meeting challenges, including increasing food production, increasing renewable sources for energy and raw materials, and providing greater safety and protection for life, assets, and the environment. The company has differentiated targets for growth in these strategic areas including future funding of capital expenditures, research and development, and marketing programs. Goals By aggressively pursuing top line growth opportunities in key markets and improving productivity, the company met or surpassed its 2009 financial goals for earnings per share, cash flow, and working capital reductions. The company announced a three-year 2010-2012 plan which includes $1 billion fixed cost productivity actions, $1 billion working capital productivity programs, and compound annual growth targets of 10 percent for sales and 20 percent for earnings per share through 2012. Sales in emerging markets, which include China, India, and the countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, are targeted to grow at a 14 percent compound annual rate from 2009 to 2012. The company has reaffirmed its commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth. Global Economic and Financial Market Impact The year 2009 was one of considerable economic change, transitioning from predominantly depressed conditions and inventory destocking in most markets during the first half of the year to resumption of growth for most businesses and markets in the latter half. Of particular importance to the company are motor vehicle and construction related markets which, while gradually improving, remained depressed for most of the year. Reflecting these conditions, the company's full year sales volume dropped 12 percent versus 2008, and selling prices remained under pressure, principally for chemical and certain polymer products. The global recessionary economic conditions along with productivity and cost reduction programs contributed to a 7 percent reduction in the company's combined costs for raw materials, energy and transportation. Depressed equity market values resulted in higher non-cash pension costs, versus 2008. While financial and credit market conditions were challenging, the company continued to access the short and long-term debt markets without difficulty. 17 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of Operations (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 NET SALES $ 26,109 $ 30,529 $ 29,378 2009 versus 2008 Consolidated net sales for 2009 were $26.1 billion, down 14 percent. This reflects 12 percent lower volume, a 1 percent increase in local selling prices, and 3 percent unfavorable currency exchange. The full year worldwide sales volume decline reflects decreases in every region for the first 9 months of the year, partly offset by year over year volume increases in certain markets during the fourth quarter. Sales in emerging markets of $8 billion declined 9 percent from 2008, while the percentage of total company sales in these markets increased to 31 percent. The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2009 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year: Percent Change Due to: (Dollars in billions) 2009 Net Sales Percent Change vs. 2008 Local Price Currency Effect Volume Portfolio Worldwide $ 26.1 (14 ) 1 (3 ) (12 ) - United States 9.8 (11 ) 2 - (11 ) (2 ) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) 7.2 (25 ) 1 (8 ) (18 ) - Asia Pacific 5.2 (5 ) (1 ) - (4 ) - Latin America 3.2 (11 ) 2 (4 ) (9 ) - Canada 0.7 (16 ) 5 (8 ) (13 ) - 2008 versus 2007 Consolidated net sales for 2008 were $30.5 billion, up 4 percent. This reflects 10 percent sales growth through September 30, partly offset by a 17 percent year-over-year sales decline in the fourth quarter, precipitated by a significant decline in demand. Full year sales reflect a 7 percent increase in local selling prices and 3 percent favorable currency exchange, partly offset by 5 percent lower volume and a 1 percent reduction from portfolio changes. Worldwide sales volumes reflect 3 percent growth in emerging markets, more than offset by significantly lower volumes in the company's major polymer, chemical, and electronic product lines sold in the U.S. and Western Europe. 18 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7.

The decrease was attributable to a $47 million reduction in interest income due to lower interest rates in 2009 partially offset by higher interest from increased cash and customer deferred receivables, and the absence of a $51 million favorable litigation settlement in 2008. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $23 million in asset sales. 2008 versus 2007 Other income, net, increased $32 million versus 2007. The increase was attributable to an increase of $211 million in equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to the absence of the 2007 impairment charge of $165 million to write down the company's investment in a polyester films joint venture in the Performance Materials segment, and a favorable $51 million litigation settlement in 2008. The increases are partially offset by additional net pre-tax exchange losses of $154 million and a decrease of $86 million in asset sales. Additional information related to the company's other income, net is included in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

COGS was 75 percent of net sales for 2009 versus 77 percent for the year 2008. The 2 percentage point decrease principally reflects a $1.1 billion decrease in the combined costs for raw materials, energy and freight and the absence of a $227 million charge for hurricane-related cleanup and repair in 2008, partially offset by significantly lower capacity utilization and an unfavorable currency impact. 2008 versus 2007 COGS for the year 2008 were $23.5 billion, versus $21.7 billion in 2007, an increase of 8 percent. COGS was 77 percent of net sales for 2008 versus 74 percent for the year 2007. The 3 percentage point increase 19 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7.

The increase in interest expense is due to higher average borrowings, partially offset by slightly lower average interest rates. Interest expense decreased $54 million in 2008 versus 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 EMPLOYEE SEPARATION/ASSET RELATED CHARGES, NET $ 210 1 $ 535 $ - 1Represents a charge of $340 million for the 2009 restructuring program and a $130 million net reduction in the estimated costs for the 2008 and 2009 restructuring programs. See below for further details on these programs. 2009 Restructuring Program In second quarter 2009, in response to the protracted global economic recession, the company committed to an initiative to address the steep and extended downturn in motor vehicle and construction markets, and the extension of the downturn into industrial markets. The plan was designed to restructure asset and fixed cost bases in order to improve long-term competitiveness, simplify business processes, and maximize pre-tax operating income. The plan includes the elimination of about 2,000 positions by severance principally located in the U.S. As a result, a charge of $340 million was recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net which pertains to the following financial statement line items: COGS – 60 percent, SG&A – 30 percent, and R&D – 10 percent. This charge includes $212 million of severance and related benefits costs, $24 million of other non-personnel costs and $104 million of asset-related charges, including $77 million for asset shut downs and write-offs, $11 million for asset impairments and $16 million for accelerated depreciation. 20 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In the fourth quarter of 2009, the company recorded a $30 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2009 restructuring program primarily due to lower than estimated individual severance costs and work force reductions through non-severance programs. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 1,000 employees have been separated related to the 2009 restructuring program, and about 150 positions were eliminated through other non-severance programs. The actions related to this program are expected to be complete by the end of 2010. These actions achieved pre-tax cost savings of about $35 million in 2009 and are expected to generate pre-tax cost savings of approximately $180 million in 2010 and approximately $250 million per year in subsequent years. 2008 Restructuring Program During 2008, in response to the challenging economic environment, the company initiated a global restructuring program to reduce costs and improve profitability across its businesses. The 2008 restructuring program included the elimination of approximately 2,500 positions principally located in Western Europe and the U.S. primarily supporting the motor vehicle and construction markets. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company recorded a charge of $535 million, which included $287 million related to employee severance costs and $248 million attributable to asset shut-downs, asset impairments and other non-personnel charges. For 2009, the restructuring charge of $535 million was reclassified from cost of goods sold and other operating charges to employee separation/asset related charges, net. In 2009, the company recorded a $100 million net reduction in the estimated costs related to the 2008 restructuring program. The $100 million net reduction in the estimated costs for the 2008 restructuring program was recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net and was primarily due to lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions through non-severance programs. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 1,700 employees have been separated related to the 2008 global restructuring program and about 400 positions were eliminated through other non-severance programs. The actions related to the 2008 restructuring program are expected to be complete by the end of 2010. These actions achieved pre-tax cost savings of about $130 million in 2009 and are expected to generate pre-tax cost savings of approximately $225 million in 2010 and approximately $250 million per year in subsequent years. Additional details related to these programs are contained in the individual segment reviews and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES $ 415 $ 381 $ 748 Effective income tax rate 19.0 % 15.9 % 20.0 % In 2009, the company recorded a tax provision of $415 million reflecting a marginal increase from 2008. The increase in the 2009 effective tax rate compared to 2008 is primarily due to geographic mix of earnings (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2008, the company recorded a tax provision of $381 million. The 2008 provision for income taxes decreased compared to 2007 primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income. The decrease in the 2008 effective tax rate is driven by the significant decrease in pre-tax income attributable to U.S. operations, where the statutory tax rate is higher than the overall global effective tax rate (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2007, the company recorded a tax provision of $748 million which included a benefit of $108 million related to tax settlements offset by net tax expense in other operating results (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 21 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's current estimate of the 2010 effective income tax rate is about 23-24 percent, excluding tax effects of exchange gains and losses which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 6 for additional detail on items that significantly impact the company's effective tax rates. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DUPONT $ 1,755 $ 2,007 $ 2,988 2009 versus 2008 Net income attributable to DuPont (""earnings"") for 2009 decreased $252 million, or 13 percent versus 2008. The decrease in earnings is principally attributable to lower sales volume, unfavorable currency impacts, and higher non-cash pension costs. Partly offsetting these factors were lower costs for raw materials, energy, and freight, benefits from cost reductions and productivity actions, lower restructuring charges, and the absence of prior-year hurricane-related charges. 2008 versus 2007 Earnings for 2008 decreased $981 million, or 33 percent versus 2007. The decrease in earnings is attributable to a substantial decline in sales volume, primarily occurring during the fourth quarter 2008, and higher fixed costs including restructuring and hurricane-related charges. Corporate Outlook For the year 2010, the company's earnings outlook is a range of $2.15 to $2.45 per share, with expected 10 percent sales growth, reflecting anticipated continued global economic recovery, increasing industrial production, and, on average, a weaker U.S. dollar versus 2009. Favorable global agriculture market and competitive conditions are expected to support continued sales and earnings growth for the Agriculture & Nutrition segment, partly offset by anticipated higher commodities costs. Demand for the company's polymer, chemical, material, and electronic product lines is expected to increase moderately versus the depressed levels of 2009. Earnings from Cozaar®/Hyzaar® are expected to decline about $690 to $740 million pre-tax, reflecting expiration of certain patents for these pharmaceuticals. The company expects approximately $410 million higher pre-tax non-cash pension costs. This is expected to be partially offset by $160 million lower pre-tax costs resulting from a change in other employee-related benefits. The company plans to continue a differential level of support for businesses expected to have above-average growth rates and margins. For 2010, the company has set targets for capital expenditures of about $1.6 billion and fixed cost productivity programs totaling about $400 million. Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted In June 2009, FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets, which is applied to financial asset transfers on or after the effective date, which is January 1, 2010 for the company's financial statements. The new requirement limits the circumstances in which a financial asset may be de-recognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire financial asset or has continuing involvement with the transferred asset. The concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, which had previously facilitated sale accounting for certain asset transfers, is removed by the new requirement. The company expects that this will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, FASB issued authoritative guidance on accounting for variable interest entities, which is effective for reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The amendments change the process for how an enterprise determines which party consolidates a variable interest entity (VIE) to a primarily qualitative analysis. The party that consolidates the VIE (the primary beneficiary) is defined as the party with (1) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. Upon adoption, reporting enterprises must reconsider their conclusions on whether an entity should be consolidated and should a change result, the effect on net assets will be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. The company expects that upon adoption this will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations. 22 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Critical Accounting Estimates The company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Long-term Employee Benefits Accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan obligations or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining working life of current employees. About 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. The company utilizes published long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate at measurement date. Where commonly available, the company considers indices of various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy and projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan: Principal U.S. Pension Plan (Dollars in billions) 2009 2008 2007 Market-related value of assets $ 14.0 $ 16.2 $ 19.3 Fair value of plan assets $ 13.9 $ 13.5 $ 19.1 Market-related value of plan assets decreased during 2009 as the value reflects the averaging of market returns over 36 months. 23 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets. The fair value of assets in all pension plans was $17.1 billion at December 31, 2009, and the related projected benefit obligations were $22.8 billion. In addition, obligations under the company's unfunded other long-term employee benefit plans were $4.1 billion at December 31, 2009. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2009: Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge) (Dollars in millions) 1/2 Percentage Point Increase 1/2 Percentage Point Decrease Discount Rate $ 71 $ (73 ) Expected rate of return on plan assets 83 (83 ) Additional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-Term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 40. Environmental Matters DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. The company has recorded a liability of $396 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued. Much of this liability results from the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, often referred to as the Superfund), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and similar state and global laws. These laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, but which are not currently the subject of enforcement activities. Federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations and could, among other things, impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company-generated waste disposal. Over the next two decades, the company could incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of PRPs. Therefore, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. Legal Contingencies The company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial 24 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that net reductions to the company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be in the range of $50 million to $75 million within the next twelve months with the majority due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions with various tax authorities. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material. At December 31, 2009, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $6,810 million, net of valuation allowance of $1,759 million. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. Valuation of Assets Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. Based on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test in 2009, no impairments exist at this time. However, the company has certain businesses within the Performance Materials segment with approximately 28 percent excess of fair value over carrying value. The aggregate goodwill balance for these businesses was approximately $200 million of the total goodwill for the Performance Materials segment of $413 million at December 31, 2009. The company's methodology for determining the fair value of its businesses is based on present value 25 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued techniques of future cash flows. Given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the potential impact on the company's businesses, there can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Information with respect to the company's significant accounting policies on long-lived assets is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Reviews Segment sales include transfers to another business segment. Products are transferred between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the market value of the products. Segment pre-tax operating income/(loss) (PTOI) is defined as operating income before income taxes, exchange gains/(losses), corporate expenses, interest and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated net sales and segment PTOI to income before income taxes for 2009, 2008 and 2007 is included in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company initiated global restructuring programs during 2009 and 2008. The 2009 and 2008 program charges reduced total segment PTOI for 2009 and 2008 by $340 million and $535 million, respectively. In addition, in 2009, the company recorded a $100 million and $30 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2008 program and 2009 programs, respectively. Below is a summary of the net impact to each segment related to the activities described above: 2009 (Charges) and Credits 2008 (Charge) (Dollars in millions) 2009 Program 2009 Net Program Reductions 2008 Net Program Reductions 2009 Net Impact 2008 Program Agriculture & Nutrition $ - $ - $ 1 $ 1 $ (18 ) Electronics & Communications (43 ) 6 - (37 ) (37 ) Performance Chemicals (66 ) 9 3 (54 ) (50 ) Performance Coatings (65 ) (11 ) 61 (15 ) (209 ) Performance Materials (110 ) 23 29 (58 ) (94 ) Safety & Protection (55 ) 8 2 (45 ) (96 ) Other (1 ) (5 ) 4 (2 ) (31 ) Total (Charge) Credit $ (340 ) $ 30 $ 100 $ (210 ) $ (535 ) AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2009 $ 8.3 $ 1,224 2008 $ 8.0 $ 1,087 2007 $ 6.8 $ 894 Agriculture & Nutrition's businesses leverage the company's technology, customer relationships, and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply and the global production agriculture industry. Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited so production growth will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted area. The segment's businesses deliver a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve 26 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. The segment's businesses operate across the food value chain from inputs for producing agriculture products to global production and distribution of soy-based food ingredients to food quality diagnostic testing equipment. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and enhance the value of grains and soy through improved seed traits, superior seed germplasm and effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. The following are Agriculture & Nutrition's operating businesses: Pioneer is the world's leading seed brand and a world leader in improving crop yields with hybrid and varietal seeds that improve grower yields and provide effective plant insect protection and herbicide tolerance. The principal products of Pioneer are hybrid seed corn and varietal soybean seed, as well as sunflower, canola, sorghum and rice. Crops grown from Pioneer seed are used to meet the global demand for animal feed, food, biofuels, and fiber. Agricultural seed research requires long-term commitment, investment and innovation. Pioneer research is focused on results that deliver higher crop yields and a consistent per acre income advantage for its customers. New product innovation is accomplished through an effective integration of superior germplasm and value added native and biotechnology traits. In 2009, Pioneer benefited from the North America launch of 26 new soybean varieties and 96 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids that include new combinations of corn borer, corn rootworm and weed management traits highlighted by the expansion of the Herculex®1 family of traits. As announced in December 2008, Pioneer is expanding its reach into new markets through its PROaccessSM business strategy to bring its seed genetics to more customers and acres around the world through a network of partners and co-brands. Sales of Pioneer seeds amounted to 18 percent, 13 percent and 11 percent of the company's total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In the spring of 2009, Monsanto Company (Monsanto) sued the company in U.S. District Court claiming that stacking seed with Pioneer's Optimum® GAT® trait and Monsanto's Roundup Ready®2 herbicide tolerance trait violates its Roundup Ready® license agreements with Monsanto. Monsanto also alleges that sales of Pioneer stacked seeds would infringe a Monsanto patent that expires in 2014. Monsanto seeks declaratory relief, unspecified damages and a permanent injunction to prevent sales of Optimum® GAT®/ Roundup Ready® stacked seeds. DuPont has filed an answer and counterclaims, including patent misuse and antitrust claims. In January 2010, the Court in response to a motion filed by Monsanto ruled that the license agreements between the companies contain an unwritten (""implied"") term that prohibits stacking the Optimum® GAT® and Roundup Ready® traits in soybean or corn seed. The Court emphasized that the company's separate antitrust and patent fraud claims were not impacted by the ruling and would, therefore, proceed. Pioneer continues to develop soybean seed in which these traits are stacked and sales could occur as soon as 2013. Pioneer also has been working to develop corn seed with the Optimum® GAT® trait that meets the company's high yield standards. Pioneer is intensifying its ongoing research efforts along multiple pathways for the corn trait working toward commercialization in the middle of the next decade. The January 2010 ruling does not change Pioneer's commercialization plans for products with the Optimum® GAT® trait. Furthermore, management believes that the Monsanto lawsuit is unlikely to adversely affect the company's commercial results for soybean and corn seed. DuPont Crop Protection serves the global production agriculture industry with crop protection products for field crops such as wheat, corn, soybean and rice; specialty crops such as fruit, nut, vine and vegetables; and non-crop segments, including forestry and land management. Principal crop protection products are weed control, disease control, and insect control products. The business continues to expand its product offerings in the professional pest control, lawn care, golf course, animal health and seed treatment markets. Nutrition & Health operates principally within the specialty food ingredients market, including soy proteins and lecithins through the Solae Company, a majority-owned venture with Bunge Limited. Nutrition & Health global production and distribution capabilities serves various areas within the food industries including meat and poultry products, consumer 1Registered Trademark of Dow AgroSciences LLC 2Registered Trademark of Monsanto 27 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued food products, dairy-alternative products and nutritional products. Nutrition & Health anticipates improved volume growth in its specialty food ingredients. 2009 versus 2008 Sales were $8.3 billion, a 4 percent increase versus the prior year, reflecting 5 percent higher USD selling prices, partially offset by a 1 percent decrease in volume. The higher USD selling prices is related to Pioneer seeds and Crop Protection proprietary insect, weed and disease control products, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts in Europe, Canada and Latin America, as well as the impact of significantly lower market-driven pricing for glyphosate resale. The decrease in volume was primarily due to lower sales of Crop Protection disease and insect control products, and lower sales of Nutrition & Health products largely offset by higher Pioneer corn and soybean seed sales market share gains in North America. PTOI for 2009 was $1.2 billion, up 13 percent versus the same period last year, principally due to the higher sales and higher value product mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts globally. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $8 billion were 16 percent higher, reflecting 14 percent higher USD selling prices and 3 percent higher volume, partially offset by a 1 percent reduction from portfolio changes. The volume growth reflects higher Pioneer sales due to increased demand for corn seeds in Europe and Brazil and record soybean seed sales in North America and Brazil due to market share gains and increased acreage shift from corn. The volume growth was also due to higher sales of Crop Protection products, mostly due to strong global demand for disease and insect control products, as well as corn and cereal weed control products in Europe. The higher USD selling prices reflect higher value product mix, pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs and favorable currency impacts across all regions. PTOI for 2008 was $1.1 billion, up 22 percent versus $894 million in 2007, principally driven by increased sales and higher value product mix, partially offset by continued funding of strategic growth investments in research and development and sales and marketing. Outlook All of the segment's businesses anticipate continued growth in 2010. Segment earnings are expected to benefit in particular from increased Pioneer corn and soybean value offerings. Pioneer will continue to build on its North American product offerings with the addition of 29 new soybean varieties and 80 new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids. Pioneer anticipates continued market share gains in key corn and soybean markets including the U.S., Canada and Latin America. In addition, Pioneer expects to drive value-based pricing coupled with continued technology adoption and penetration. The introduction of new DuPont Crop Protection products and technology is projected to support volume and targeted market segment share gains in growth and emerging markets. However, price pressure on crop protection products is expected to intensify after three years of positive momentum, and combined with higher projected production and raw material costs, are expected to moderate results. Continued productivity and business improvement actions across the segment will continue to reduce the impact of rising costs.

The segment leverages DuPont's strong materials and technology base to target growth opportunities for its products in markets such as semiconductors, photovoltaics, displays, packaging graphics, and ink-jet printing. In the fast growing photovoltaics market, the company continues to be a leading supplier of conductors and fluoropolymer films for crystalline silicon cell and module manufacturers. To 28 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued meet one of the fastest growing segments of the solar energy market, DuPont Apollo Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, began producing thin-film photovoltaic modules in 2009. Beyond photovoltaics, the segment is investing in its broad portfolio of materials for semiconductor fabrication and packaging, as well as its innovative materials for circuit applications, to address critical needs of semiconductor and electronics manufacturers. In the market for flat panel displays, the segment continues to be a leading materials supplier for plasma displays. In addition, the segment continues to invest in developing materials technologies for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. In packaging graphics, products such as Cyrel®FAST have rapidly grown, solidifying the segment's market leadership position. DuPont is also expanding its leadership position in black pigmented inks and investing in color pigmented inks for network printing applications. In January 2010, the segment announced an investment of $175 million to complete the multi-phase expansion of its high-performance DuPont Tedlar® PV2001 series oriented film production line. This investment is in addition to $120 million in capacity expansions, announced in August 2009 for raw materials used to make the film, bringing the total commitment of these two phases to $295 million. Tedlar® films serve as the critical component of photovoltaic backsheets, providing long-term durability and performance for photovoltaic modules in all-weather conditions. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $1.9 billion were down 13 percent, reflecting 11 percent volume decline and 2 percent lower USD selling prices. The lower volumes reflect the effect of the global economic recession which impacted sales for products across all key markets. However, sales volumes improved throughout the year, most significantly in Asia Pacific, where sales were essentially flat when compared to 2008. The lower USD selling prices were mainly due to contractual pass-through of lower precious metal prices. PTOI was $87 million compared to $251 million in prior year. The decline in PTOI was primarily due to the impact of lower sales, lower income from affiliates, and higher charges associated with low capacity utilization of production lines. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $2.2 billion were up 3 percent, reflecting 4 percent higher USD selling prices, partially offset by a 1 percent decline in volume. The higher USD selling prices mainly reflect pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs and favorable currency impacts in Europe and Asia Pacific. The lower volumes reflect decreased demand for products across the segment key markets, mostly towards the end of 2008, partially offset by increased demand for photovoltaic products and higher sales in emerging markets. PTOI was $251 million as compared to $314 million in 2007. This decline was mainly due to the impact of higher raw materials cost, lower sales volumes and the $37 million charge related to the 2008 restructuring program. Outlook For 2010, sales for electronic materials, photovoltaics and packaging graphics products are expected to increase as markets recover from the global economic recession, and selling prices increase from pass-through of higher precious metal costs. In addition, segment earnings are expected to increase reflecting the impact of higher volumes, cost control initiatives, and benefits from the 2009 restructuring program. 29 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7.

The following are Performance Chemicals' operating businesses: DuPont Titanium Technologies is the world's largest manufacturer of titanium dioxide, and is dedicated to creating greater, more rewarding value for the coatings, paper, plastics, specialties and minerals markets through service, brand, and product. The business' main products include its broad line of DuPont™ Ti-Pure® titanium dioxide products, and Starblast® abrasives. DuPont Chemicals and Fluoroproducts is a leading global manufacturer of industrial and specialty fluorochemicals, fluoropolymers, and performance chemicals. The business' broad line of products that include refrigerants, lubricants, propellants, solvents, fire extinguishants and electronic gases, cover a wide range of industries and markets. Key brands include DuPontTM Teflon®, Dymel®, Isceon®, Suva®, Vertrel®, Zyron®, Vazo® and Virkon®. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $5.0 billion were 18 percent lower than last year, due to a 12 percent decline in volume and 6 percent lower USD selling prices. The lower volume principally reflects decreased demand for industrial chemicals and fluoroproducts across all regions reflecting the impact of the current economic downturn. Sales of titanium dioxide products recovered during the second half of 2009, and were higher than the pre-recession levels in the second half of 2007. The lower USD selling prices were mainly due to contractual pass-through of lower raw material prices and unfavorable currency impact in Europe and Asia Pacific. PTOI was $547 million compared to $687 million in the prior year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the impact of lower volumes, partially offset by fixed costs reductions. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $6.0 billion were 3 percent higher when compared to 2007, due to 12 percent higher USD selling prices, partially offset by a 7 percent decline in volume and a 2 percent decrease from portfolio changes. The higher USD selling prices primarily reflect pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs, contractual pass-through of raw material price changes, and positive currency impact in Europe and Latin America. The lower volume reflects decreased demand for titanium dioxide, fluoroproducts and specialty chemicals due to the impact of the global economic downturn. 2008 PTOI was $687 million compared to $921 million in 2007. The decline in PTOI was mainly due to the impact of higher raw material costs and lower volumes, and the $50 million restructuring charge recorded in 2008, partially offset by a $39 million benefit related to a gain on a land sale and inventory valuation adjustments. Outlook Performance Chemicals sales are expected to increase in 2010 as a result of higher global demand for titanium dioxide and specialty chemicals, positive currency impacts and higher prices to offset raw material cost increases. Total segment earnings are also expected to increase significantly due to the impact of higher sales, lower fixed costs and benefits from the 2008 and 2009 restructuring programs. This segment manufactures products that could be affected by uncertainties associated with PFOA matters. See the discussion on page 45 under the subheading PFOA for further information. 30 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued PERFORMANCE COATINGS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2009 $ 3.4 $ 69 2008 $ 4.4 $ (8 ) 2007 $ 4.3 $ 366 Performance Coatings is one of the world's leading motor vehicle coatings suppliers. Products offered include high performance liquid and powder coatings for motor vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the motor vehicle after-market, and general industrial applications, such as coatings for heavy equipment, pipes and appliances and electrical insulation. The company markets its after-market coatings products using the DuPont™ Standox®, Spies Hecker® and Nason® brand names. Standox® and Spies Hecker® are focused on the high-end motor vehicle after-markets, while Nason® is primarily focused on economy coating applications. In 2009 and 2008, the segment experienced a significant decline in sales, mainly to the OEMs markets, due to the impact of the global economic recession in the automotive industry. In addition, the North American automotive industry continued to experience structural changes, including the loss of U.S. market share by U.S. automakers. In 2009 the global production of automobiles and light trucks declined by 14 percent reflecting declines of 33 percent in North America, and 10 percent in the rest of the world, which was partially offset by an increase in production of 44 percent in Greater China. The industry production forecast for 2010 projects a global increase of about 9 percent, with increased production in all regions. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $3.4 billion were down 21 percent when compared to prior year, reflecting a 20 percent decline in volume and 1 percent lower USD selling prices. The decline in volume reflects the impact of fewer motor vehicle and industrial truck builds of motor vehicle OEMs, and lower sales of industrial and after-market products in all regions. Sales to OEMs improved substantially during the second half of 2009, mostly due to the impact of government incentives programs and higher sales in Asia Pacific. Sales of after-market and industrial coatings have experienced a slower recovery from the inventory destocking experienced in the industry during fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. The lower USD selling prices reflect unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by higher local selling prices. PTOI was $69 million as compared to a loss of $8 million in 2008. The improvement in PTOI is primarily due to lower fixed costs, and the net year-over-year impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities, partially offset by the effect of lower volumes. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $4.4 billion were essentially flat when compared to 2007, reflecting 7 percent higher USD selling prices, offset by a 7 percent volume decline. The higher USD selling prices primarily reflect favorable currency impacts in Europe and Latin America and pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs. The decrease in volume was primarily due to lower sales of products sold to OEMs in North America and Europe, partially offset by higher sales of after-market and industrial coatings products and strong sales in emerging markets. Pre-tax loss of $8 million compared to income of $366 million in 2007. Year-over-year decline in PTOI reflects the impact of the 2008 restructuring charge, as well as the impact of higher raw material costs and lower volumes, partially offset by higher prices. Outlook For 2010, the segment expects sales increases that will exceed the OEMs build growth due to expected recovery of OEMs and light truck markets and positive currency impacts. PTOI is also expected to increase significantly due to fixed costs reductions, benefits from the company's 2008 and 2009 restructuring programs and the impact of higher sales. 31 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued PERFORMANCE MATERIALS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2009 $ 4.8 $ 287 2008 $ 6.4 $ 128 2007 $ 6.6 $ 626 Performance Materials' businesses provide productive, higher performance polymers, elastomers, films, parts, and systems and solutions which improve the uniqueness, functionality and profitability of its customers' offerings. The key markets served by the segment include the automotive OEM and associated after-market industries, as well as electrical, electronics, packaging, construction, oil, photovoltaics, aerospace, chemical processing and consumer durable goods. The following are Performance Materials' operating businesses: Performance Polymers delivers a broad range of polymer-based high performance materials in its product portfolio, including elastomers and thermoplastic and thermoset engineering polymers which are used by customers to fabricate components for mechanical, chemical and electrical systems. The main products include: DuPont™ Zytel® nylon resins, Delrin® acetal resins, Hytrel® polyester thermoplastic elastomer resins, Tynex® filaments, Vespel® parts and shapes, Vamac® ethylene acrylic elastomer, Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer and Viton® fluoroelastomers. Performance Polymers also includes the DuPont Teijin Films joint venture, whose primary products are Mylar® and Melinex® polyester films. Packaging & Industrial Polymers specializes in resins and films used in packaging and industrial polymer applications, sealants and adhesives, sporting goods, and interlayers for laminated safety glass. Key brands include: DuPont™ Surlyn® ionomer resins, Bynel® coextrudable adhesive resins, Elvax® EVA resins, SentryGlas® and Butacite® laminate interlayers. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $4.8 billion were 26 percent lower reflecting 18 percent lower volumes, 6 percent decrease in USD selling prices, and a 2 percent reduction related to portfolio changes. The decrease in volume mainly reflects the effect of the global economic recession and the inventory destocking experienced during the first part of the 2009. However, sales continuously improved during the second half of 2009, both sequentially and when compared to 2008, mainly due to overall economic recovery and higher sales to the motor vehicle industry. The lower USD selling prices were a combination of significantly weaker product sales mix, unfavorable currency impacts, and for certain products, lower selling prices in response to lower feedstock costs. 2009 PTOI was $287 million compared to $128 million in 2008. The improvement in PTOI reflects the impact of lower raw material, energy and freight costs, lower fixed costs, the absence of a $216 million hurricane-related charge in 2008, a $26 million benefit in 2009 related to a reduction in the hurricane-related reserve, proceeds from hurricane-related insurance recoveries of $56 million received in 2009, and the net year-over-year impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities. The company is aggressively pursuing additional insurance recoveries in the range of $50 – $100 million. 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $6.4 billion were 3 percent lower, reflecting a 13 percent decrease in volume and a 1 percent reduction from portfolio changes, which more than offset 11 percent higher USD selling prices. Sales volume declines were more pronounced beginning late in the third quarter, with continued and accelerated deterioration through the fourth quarter, and occurred in all major regions and end-use market segments. The decline reflected a broad industry movement to reduce inventory and improve cash positions to manage through weak global economic demand. Volumes were also negatively impacted by extended operating unit shutdowns related to the time taken to implement facility repairs stemming from damages associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Operating units outages associated with the hurricanes were of varying lengths depending on the level of damage incurred and the ability to obtain utilities and ingredients to enable a restart. 32 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2008 PTOI was $128 million compared to $626 million in 2007. 2008 PTOI includes charges related to hurricane damages of $216 million. In addition, as part of the company's restructuring program, the segment recorded a charge of $94 million to cover employee termination costs and other asset related charges. The decline in PTOI was also influenced by charges associated with low capacity utilization of production units to reduce inventories due to the decreased demand. The decrease in PTOI in 2008 was partially offset by the absence of a $165 million impairment charge in 2007 to write down the company's investment in a polyester films joint venture. Outlook 2010 sales are expected to grow due to anticipated increases in global motor vehicle OEMs builds and continued recovery from the global economic recession for most of the markets served by the segment. PTOI is also expected to improve due to the impact of higher sales, improved fixed cost performance, benefits from the company's 2008 and 2009 restructuring programs and market-driven innovations for products and processes. SAFETY & PROTECTION Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2009 $ 2.8 $ 260 2008 $ 3.7 $ 661 2007 $ 3.7 $ 1,032 Safety & Protection's businesses satisfy the growing global needs of businesses, governments and consumers for solutions that make life safer, healthier and more secure. By uniting market-driven science with the strength of highly regarded brands, the segment delivers products and services to a large number of markets including, construction, transportation, communications, industrial chemicals, oil and gas, electric utilities, automotive, manufacturing, defense, homeland security and safety consulting. The following are Safety & Protection's operating businesses: Protection Technologies is focused on finding solutions to protect lives, property, critical processes, and the environment. With products like DuPontTM Kevlar® and Nomex® the business continues to hold strong positions in life protection markets and meet the continued demand for body armor and personal protective gear for the military, law enforcement personnel, firefighters and other first responders, as well as for workers in the oil and gas industry around the world. Building Innovations is committed to the building science behind increasing the performance of building systems, helping reduce operating costs and creating more sustainable structures. The business is a market leader of solid surfaces through its Corian®, Montelli® line of products which offer durable and versatile materials for residential and commercial purposes. Other products such as Tyvek® and Typar® offer leading solutions for the protection and energy efficiency of the buildings. Sustainable Solutions continues to help organizations worldwide reduce workplace injuries and fatalities while improving operating costs, productivity and quality. Sustainable Solutions is a leader in the safety consulting field, selling training products, as well as consulting services. Additionally, Sustainable Solutions is dedicated to clean air, clean fuel, and clean water with offerings that help reduce sulfur and other emissions, formulate cleaner fuels, or dispose of liquid waste. Its goal is to help maintain business continuity and environmental compliance for companies in the refining and petrochemical industries, as well as for government entities. In 2008, the company completed the acquisition of Coastal Training Technologies Corp., which is one of the world's leading publishers of safety, industrial skills and employee development training programs. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $2.8 billion were 25 percent lower than last year, due to a 23 percent decline in volume and 3 percent lower USD selling prices, partially offset by a 1 percent increase from portfolio changes. The lower volume reflects decreased demand for products across all markets and regions due to the impact of the current economic downturn. The lower USD selling prices were mainly due to unfavorable currency impact in Europe and Asia Pacific. PTOI was $260 million compared to $661 million in the prior year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the impact of lower volumes and charges associated with low capacity utilization of production units, partially offset by fixed costs reductions. 33 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2008 versus 2007 Sales of $3.7 billion were flat when compared to 2007, due to 5 percent higher USD selling prices, offset by a 5 percent decline in volume. Decreased volume primarily reflects lower sales to the U.S. residential and construction markets and the automotive industry, which accelerated and spread to other key markets during the fourth quarter. The higher USD selling prices primarily reflect pricing actions to offset the increases of raw materials costs and positive currency impact in Europe and Latin America. 2008 PTOI was $661 million compared to $1,032 million in 2007. The decreased earnings were primarily due to higher production costs and the impact of lower volumes related to the global recession. In addition, 2008 PTOI includes a charge of $96 million to cover employee separation costs and other asset related charges as part of the company restructuring program. Outlook For 2010, sales are expected to benefit from improved global market conditions. Demand for Kevlar® and Nomex® is expected to increase due to public sector sales growth and strengthening in the motor vehicle and personal protection markets. Sales related to the Building Innovations business are expected to increase due to global market improvements, continued volume increases in the U.S. and European residential construction markets and new product introductions. Earnings in 2010 will also include benefits from the restructuring actions announced in 2009 and 2008. PHARMACEUTICALS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2009 $ - $ 1,037 2008 $ - $ 1,025 2007 $ - $ 949 On October 1, 2001, DuPont Pharmaceuticals was sold to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. DuPont retained its interest in Cozaar® (losartan potassium) and Hyzaar® (losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide). These drugs were discovered by DuPont and developed in collaboration with Merck and are used in the treatment of hypertension. The U.S. patents covering the compounds, pharmaceutical formulation and use for the treatment of hypertension, including approval for pediatric use, will expire in 2010. DuPont has exclusively licensed worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights for Cozaar® and Hyzaar® to Merck. Pharmaceuticals receives net proceeds and royalties as outlined below. Merck is responsible for manufacturing, marketing and selling Cozaar® and Hyzaar®. Pharmaceuticals' Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income is the sum of two parts: income related to a share of the profits from North American sales and certain markets in EMEA, and royalty income derived from worldwide contract net sales linked to the exclusivity term in a particular country. Patents and exclusivity have already started to expire and the U.S. exclusivity for Cozaar® ends in April 2010. The worldwide agreement terminates when the following conditions are met: (i) the Canadian exclusivity ends in 2013, and (ii) North American sales fall below a certain level. Therefore, absent any major changes in the markets, the company expects its income to take its first significant step-down in 2010, and from that year on, continue to step-down each year to zero when the contract ends, which is expected to be after 2013. In general, management expects a traditional sales, earnings and cash decline for a drug going off patent in the pharmaceutical industry. In the fourth quarter the company recorded a $63 million charge to other income, net and a reduction to accounts and notes receivable, net in the Pharmaceuticals segment to reflect increased rebates and other sales deductions related to the Cozaar®/Hyzaar® licensing agreement. Refer to Note 27 for further information. Outlook The company expects revenues from Cozaar®/Hyzaar® to significantly decrease after the U.S. patents expire in 2010. Earnings contributions to the company from the collaboration with Merck are expected to decline in 2010 about $690 – $740 million pre-tax from earnings generated in 2009. 34 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued OTHER The company includes certain embryonic businesses not included in the reportable segments, such as Applied BioSciences and nonaligned businesses in Other. The potential viability of each embryonic business depends on a number of factors including successful product development, market acceptance and production ramp up capabilities. Using these factors and others, management periodically assesses the potential and fit of these businesses and may make investment adjustments based on such assessments. Applied BioSciences is focused on the development and commercialization of products to serve our customers with superior performing sustainable solutions that target industries spanning across energy, materials and health through the application of biotechnology, chemistry, materials science and engineering in an integrated fashion. Specific global growth projects across the company are consolidated within Applied BioSciences to capitalize on the market opportunities and technology needs in this high-growth industry, including biomaterial and advanced biofuels products and technologies. Applied BioSciences will provide advantaged products for agricultural energy crops, feedstock processing and advanced biofuels through two businesses: one to commercialize non-food, cellulosic ethanol and the second to commercialize biobutanol. To accelerate commercialization, DuPont has formed a joint venture with Danisco, DuPont Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol LLC (DDCE), for the cellulosic ethanol technology. For biobutanol, a joint venture with BP p.l.c. was formed in 2009, Butamax™ Advanced Biofuels LLC. DDCE now operates a demonstration scale facility in Vonore, Tennessee that is working to optimize technologies for large-scale production. Butamax™ expects start-up of its demonstration scale in Hull, United Kingdom in 2010. DuPont continues its joint venture with Tate & Lyle PLC, DuPont Tate and Lyle Bio Products LLC, to produce 1,3-propanediol (Bio-PDO™) using a proprietary fermentation and purification process using renewable feedstocks. Bio-PDO™ is the key building block for DuPont™ Sorona® polymer and DuPont™ Cerenol™ polyols, two new families of renewably sourced products. Under the Zemea® propanediol and Susterra® propanediol brands, it is also being marketed for use as an ingredient in nearly 150 direct applications ranging from industrial to personal care uses. The first commercial-scale plant to manufacture Bio-PDO™ began production in November 2006, marking the beginning of commercial availability of the company's bio-based pipeline. Nonaligned businesses include activities and costs associated with Benlate® fungicide and other discontinued businesses. In the aggregate, sales in Other for 2009, 2008 and 2007 represent less than 1 percent of total segment sales. 2009 pre-tax loss of $171 million compared to a loss of $181 million in 2008. The lower pre-tax loss for the year was mainly due to the net year-over-year impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities, and lower pre-tax loss for Applied BioSciences. 2008 pre-tax loss of $181 million compared to a loss of $224 million in 2007. The improvement for the year was mainly due to a benefit of $51 million from a litigation settlement in 2008 and the absence of a $69 million charge recorded in 2007 for litigation related to a discontinued business. Liquidity & Capital Resources Management believes the company's ability to generate cash from operations, coupled with cost reduction initiatives and access to capital markets, will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, debt maturities and other cash needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. The company's current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings have not been materially impacted by the current credit environment. In addition, cash generating actions have been implemented including spending reductions and restructuring to better align capital expenditures and costs. The company will continue to monitor the financial markets in order to respond to changing conditions. Pursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of $6.1 billion as of December 31, 2009, provide primary liquidity to support all 35 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued short-term obligations. The company has access to approximately $2.6 billion in unused credit lines with several major financial institutions, as additional support to meet short term liquidity needs. These credit lines are primarily multi-year facilities. The company continually reviews its debt portfolio and occasionally may rebalance it to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum maturity debt schedule. The company's long term and short term credit ratings are as follows: Long term Short term Outlook Standard & Poor A A-1 Negative Moody's Investors Service A2 P-1 Negative Fitch Ratings A F1 Negative Fitch Ratings recently affirmed the company's A long term and F1 short term ratings and revised their outlook to negative from stable. The company does not expect this action to impact liquidity or cost of debt. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by operating activities $ 4,741 $ 3,129 $ 4,290 The company's cash provided by operating activities was $4.7 billion in 2009, a $1.6 billion increase from the $3.1 billion generated in 2008. The increase is primarily due to the benefit of the weaker dollar, which was hedged by forward exchange contracts in investing activities. The company's cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion in 2008, a $1.2 billion decrease from the $4.3 billion generated in 2007. The decrease is primarily due to lower earnings and the impact of the stronger dollar on working capital items, which was hedged by forward exchange contracts in investing activities. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash used for investing activities $ (4,298 ) $ (1,610 ) $ (1,750 ) In 2009, cash used for investing activities totaled $4.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion used in 2008. The $2.7 billion increase was mainly due to the increase in investments in short-term financial instruments and the change in forward exchange contract settlements, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures. In 2008, cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion used in 2007. The $140 million decrease was mainly due to higher proceeds from forward exchange contract settlements, partially offset by increased capital expenditures, lower proceeds from asset sales and higher expenditures for businesses acquired. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.3 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2009 spending is primarily related to the company's cash management initiatives and matching capacity with market demand. The company expects 2010 purchases of plant, property and equipment to be $1.6 billion, an increase of $300 million over 2009, driven by growth investments. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash (used for) provided by financing activities $ (97 ) $ 878 $ (3,069 ) The $1.0 billion increase in cash used for financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to payments on maturing debt. The $3.9 billion increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to the increase in the net proceeds from borrowings and the absence of the purchase of common stock, which were partly offset by the decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options. During the fourth quarter of 2008, interest rate swaps were terminated with a combined notional amount of $1.25 billion for cash proceeds of $226 million, which are 36 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued classified within financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These proceeds will be amortized to earnings as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the debt, through 2018. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by operating activities $ 4,741 $ 3,129 $ 4,290 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (1,308 ) (1,978 ) (1,585 ) Free cash flow $ 3,433 $ 1,151 $ 2,705 Free cash flow is a measurement not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities, and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process. The company exceeded its 2009 free cash flow goal of $2.5 billion due to working capital productivity and the currency impact on net monetary assets with the offset in forward exchange contract settlements within investing activities. For 2010, the company has set a free cash flow target of greater than $1.5 billion, while continuing to support growth investments including $1.6 billion of capital investment and working capital increases from improved levels of demand. Total debt at December 31, 2009 was $11.0 billion, a $1.4 billion increase from December 31, 2008. The proceeds from the increased borrowings were primarily invested in short-term financial instruments. Total debt at December 31, 2008 was $9.7 billion, a $2.4 billion increase from December 31, 2007. The proceeds from the increased borrowings were invested in cash equivalents and used for general corporate purposes. Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.5 billion in 2009 and 2008, and $1.4 billion in 2007. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.64 in 2009 and 2008, and $1.52 in 2007. The common dividend declared in the first quarter 2010 was the company's 422nd consecutive dividend since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904. The company's Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share buyback plan in June 2001. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, there were no purchases of stock under this program. As of December 31, 2009, the company has purchased 20.5 million shares at a total cost of $962 million. Management has not established a timeline for the buyback of the remaining shares of stock under this plan. In October 2005, the Board of Directors authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan. In 2007, the company purchased 34.7 million shares for $1.7 billion, thereby, completing this program. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of shares activity. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $6.1 billion at December 31, 2009, $3.7 billion at December 31, 2008 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007. The $2.4 increase from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to cash proceeds from increased borrowings and cash generated from general business activities. The $2.3 billion increase from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to net increase in borrowings. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee Contracts Indemnifications In connection with acquisitions and divestitures, the company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures and related business activities prior to the completion of the transaction. The term of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and 37 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued product liabilities, is generally indefinite. In addition, the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, against liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the company, such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters. If the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $100 million and $110 million, respectively. Although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued, due to the nature of indemnified items, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist. In connection with the 2004 sale of the majority of the net assets of Textiles and Interiors, the company indemnified INVISTA against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal and environmental matters and other representations and warranties under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The estimated fair value of the indemnity obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement is $70 million and is included in the indemnifications balance of $100 million at December 31, 2009. Under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the company's total indemnification obligation for the majority of the representations and warranties cannot exceed $1.4 billion. The other indemnities are not subject to this limit. In March 2008, INVISTA filed suit in the Southern District of New York alleging that certain representations and warranties in the Purchase and Sale Agreement were breached and, therefore, that DuPont is obligated to indemnify it. DuPont disagrees with the extent and value of INVISTA's claims. DuPont has not changed its estimate of its total indemnification obligation under the Purchase and Sale Agreement as a result of the lawsuit. Obligations for Equity Affiliates and Others The company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates, customers, suppliers and other affiliated and unaffiliated companies. At December 31, 2009, the company had directly guaranteed $684 million of such obligations, plus $119 million relating to guarantees of obligations for divested subsidiaries. This represents the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees. The company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, a liability of $146 million and $121 million, respectively, was recorded for these obligations, representing the amount of payment/performance risk which the company deems probable. This liability is principally related to obligations of the company's polyester films joint venture which are guaranteed by the company. Existing guarantees for customers, suppliers and other unaffiliated companies arose as part of contractual agreements. Existing guarantees for equity affiliates and other affiliated companies arose for liquidity needs in normal operations. In certain cases, the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers. The company has guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities of its divested subsidiaries including Conoco and Consolidation Coal Sales Company. Conoco and Consolidation Coal Sales Company have indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2009, the company had no liabilities recorded for these obligations. Additional information with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees. Master Operating Leases Prior to November 2009, the company leased short-lived equipment under a master operating lease program. Lease payments for these assets totaled $38 million in 2009, $55 million in 2008 and $59 million in 2007, and were reported as operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statements. The leases under this program were considered operating leases and accordingly the related assets and liabilities were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance 38 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Sheets. In November 2009 the lease was terminated. The company purchased the assets for a total of $53 million, the residual value of the assets at the lease termination date. Contractual Obligations Information related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In (Dollars in millions) Total at December 31, 2009 2010 2011 – 2012 2013 – 2014 2015 and beyond Long-term and short-term debt1 $ 10,502 $ 981 $ 409 $ 3,232 $ 5,880 Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity 3,403 440 875 618 1,470 Capital leases1 8 1 - 3 4 Operating leases 915 221 336 211 147 Purchase obligations2 Information technology infrastructure & services 295 144 119 24 8 Raw material obligations 244 123 80 29 12 Utility obligations 395 300 53 10 32 INVISTA-related obligations3 1,778 327 580 583 288 Human resource services 108 36 72 - - Other4 47 33 13 - 1 Total purchase obligations 2,867 963 917 646 341 Other liabilities1,5 Workers' compensation 74 16 31 13 14 Asset retirement obligations 56 6 8 10 32 Environmental remediation 396 70 148 88 90 Legal settlements 40 33 7 - - License agreement6 503 90 179 170 64 Other7 134 28 21 22 63 Total other long-term liabilities 1,203 243 394 303 263 Total contractual obligations $ 18,898 $ 2,849 $ 2,931 $ 5,013 $ 8,105 1Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement. 3Includes raw material supply obligations of $1.7 billion and contract manufacturing obligations of $18 million. 4Primarily represents obligations associated with distribution, health care/benefit administration, research and development and other professional and consulting contracts. 5Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have been excluded from the table as they are discussed below within Long-Term Employee Benefits. 6Represents remaining expected payments under a license agreement between Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. and Monsanto Company. 7Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other postretirement benefits. 39 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations. Long-Term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability and life insurance protection for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits. Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. No contributions are required to be made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2010 and no contributions are currently anticipated. Contributions beyond 2010 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $306 million in 2009 and anticipates that it will make approximately $270 million in contributions in 2010 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan. In August 2006, the company announced major changes to the pension and defined contribution benefits that cover the majority of its U.S. employees. Effective January 1, 2007, for such employees hired on that date or thereafter, and effective January 1, 2008, for such active employees on the rolls as of December 31, 2006, the company contributes 100 percent of the first 6 percent of the employee's contribution election. Additionally, for such employees, the company contributes 3 percent of each eligible employee's compensation regardless of the employee's contribution election. The definition of eligible compensation has also been expanded to be similar to the definition of eligible compensation used in determining pension benefits. Such full service employees on the rolls as of December 31, 2006 will also accrue additional benefits in the pension plan, but the annual rate of pension accrual is about one-third of the previous rate. In addition, company-paid postretirement survivor benefits for such employees do not continue to grow after December 31, 2007. Such employees hired in the U.S. after December 31, 2006 do not participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans. The company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $323 million, $326 million and $315 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $341 million in 2010. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles. 40 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges and credits related to long-term employee benefits. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Defined benefit plan (benefits)/charges $ 155 $ (362 ) $ (54 ) Defined contribution plan charges 245 250 1 99 Other long-term employee benefit charges 220 181 192 Net amount $ 620 $ 69 $ 237 1Includes an accrual of $16 million for company match and contribution based on compensation paid in 2009 for 2008 service. The above (benefits)/charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The increase in pension expense in 2009 primarily reflects unfavorable returns on pension assets during 2008. The decrease in pension expense in 2008 primarily reflects favorable returns on pension assets during 2007. The company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2010, long-term employee benefits expense is expected to increase by about $410 million, principally due to lower market-related value of pension assets. Other Employee-Related Benefits In October 2009, the company announced revisions to its vacation benefits policy covering all U.S. employees. Effective December 31, 2010, entitled vacation for the following year will no longer vest at the end of each preceding year. In addition, vacation will be earned monthly and accrued on the first day of each calendar month during the year beginning in 2011. These revisions to the company's vacation benefits policy will provide a one-time benefit of approximately $160 million in 2010. Environmental Matters DuPont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, DuPont implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, DuPont incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. Related to these activities, DuPont incurred environmental operating costs of $483 million in 2009, $525 million in 2008 and $500 million in 2007. Remediation Expenditures RCRA, which extensively regulates the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination. If conditions warrant, companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, the costs of the RCRA corrective action 41 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued program are typically borne solely by the company. The company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required over the next two decades. Annual expenditures for the near term, however, are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. The company's expenditures associated with RCRA and similar remediation activities were approximately $49 million, $51 million and $47 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. From time to time, the company receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a PRP under CERCLA or similar state statutes. CERCLA is often referred to as the Superfund and requires companies to undertake certain investigative and research activities at sites where it conducts or once conducted operations or where company generated waste has been disposed. The company has also, on occasion, been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company's past operations. As of December 31, 2009, the company has been notified of potential liability under CERCLA or state laws at about 400 sites around the U.S., with active remediation under way at approximately 150 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 165 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at three new sites during 2009 compared with five and six similar notices in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The company's expenditures associated with CERCLA and similar state remediation activities were approximately $18 million, $17 million and $20 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For nearly all Superfund sites, the company's potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other PRPs at any given site is typically relatively low. Other PRPs at sites, where the company is a party, typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and, where they do not, or where PRPs cannot be located or have declared bankruptcy, the company's own share of liability has not materially increased. There are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites and at all CERCLA sites in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Total expenditures for previously accrued remediation activities under RCRA, CERCLA and similar state and global laws were $72 million, $81 million and $68 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Remediation Accruals At December 31, 2009, the Consolidated Balance Sheets included an accrued liability of $396 million related to activities under RCRA, CERCLA and similar state and global laws compared to $379 million at December 31, 2008. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, particularly those related to RCRA, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2009. Of the $396 million accrued liability, approximately ten percent was reserved for non-U.S. facilities. Approximately 65 percent of the reserve balance was attributable to RCRA and similar remediation liabilities, while about 25 percent was attributable to CERCLA liabilities. Remediation accruals of $89 million, $103 million and $76 million were added to the reserve in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that a material loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site or location is reasonably possible. 42 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Changes in the remediation accruals balance at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized below: (Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2007 $ 357 Remediation Payments (81 ) Increase in Reserve 103 Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 379 Remediation Payments (72 ) Increase in Reserve 89 Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 396 Pre-Tax Environmental Expenses Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized below. At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Environmental Operating Costs $ 483 $ 525 $ 500 Increase in Remediation Accruals 89 103 76 $ 572 $ 628 $ 576 About 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2009 resulted from operations in the U.S. Total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to operations in 2009 decreased $56 million versus 2008 due principally to decreased environmental research activities and a year over year decline in the increase in the remediation accrual. The decrease in total pre-tax environmental expenses in 2009 versus 2008, compared to an increase of $52 million in 2008 versus 2007 is not material to DuPont's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on DuPont's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Environmental Capital Expenditures In 2009, DuPont spent approximately $89 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $125 million in 2010. In the U.S., significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures. Total CAA capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from $40 million to $70 million. Climate Change DuPont believes that climate change is an important global issue that will present risks and opportunities to business and society at large. Since the early 1990s when DuPont began taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the company has achieved major global reductions in emissions. Voluntary emissions reductions implemented by DuPont and other companies are valuable but alone will not be sufficient to effectively address a problem of this scale. DuPont is actively engaged in the effort to develop constructive public policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. 43 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in February 2005 and, while not ratified by the U.S., has spurred policy action by many other countries and regions around the world including the European Union. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of a post-2012 international policy framework to guide international action to address climate change when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. At the national and regional level, there are existing efforts to address climate change. Several DuPont facilities in the European Union are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (""EU ETS."") In other countries, including the U.S., policy debate continues. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S., adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. If in the absence of federal legislation, states were to implement programs mandating GHG emissions reductions, DuPont, its suppliers and customers could be competitively disadvantaged by the added administrative costs and burden of complying with a variety of state-specific requirements. A 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling directed EPA to determine whether carbon dioxide endangers human health and, if so, to take steps to regulate it under the CAA. In December 2009, EPA made a determination that carbon dioxide emissions endanger human health and the environment requiring EPA to pursue regulation of carbon dioxide emissions under the CAA. Such regulation by EPA, in the absence of or in addition to federal legislation, could result in more costly, less efficient facility-by-facility controls versus a federal, market-based cap and trade program. Differences in regional or national legislation could present challenges in a global marketplace highlighting the need for coordinated global policy action. In the fourth quarter 2009, EPA issued the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule which requires reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States beginning in 2010. EPA may adopt additional requirements under the rule. The rule requires suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial greenhouse gases, manufacturers of vehicles and engines, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more per year of GHG emissions to submit annual reports to EPA. DuPont has about 30 sites that have a stake in one or more of the covered gases at which emissions monitoring equipment must be installed. Until all regulatory requirements under the rule are finalized, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding cost estimates. Based on the final rule and EPA's 2009 proposal regarding additional requirements, management does not expect that the cost to comply with the rule will be material to its operations and consolidated financial position. The company assesses the potential risks that climate change could present, and looks for opportunities to make its overall portfolio less energy and emissions intensive. DuPont weighs energy use when investments or divestitures are considered. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. Registration The goal of the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is to prevent unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment associated with the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of chemical substances. Under TSCA, the EPA has established reporting, record-keeping, testing and control-related requirements for new and existing chemicals. In September 2009, EPA announced its comprehensive approach to enhance the Agency's current chemicals management program under TSCA, including development of action plans. The Agency's actions on chemicals may include initiating regulatory action to label, restrict, or ban a chemical, or to require the submission of additional data needed to determine the risk a chemical may pose. Also in 2009, EPA announced its ""Essential Principle for Reform of Chemicals Management Legislation."" The company is monitoring these developments under TSCA. In December 2006, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals. This regulatory framework known as REACH entered into force on June 1, 2007. One 44 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued of its main objectives is the protection of human health and the environment. REACH requires manufacturers and importers to gather information on the properties of their substances that meet certain volume or toxicological criteria and register the information in a central database to be maintained by the European Chemicals Agency. The Regulation also contains a mechanism for the progressive substitution of the most dangerous chemicals when suitable alternatives have been identified. Complete registrations containing extensive data on the characteristics of the chemical will be required in three phases, depending on production usage or tonnage imported per year, and the toxicological criteria of the chemical. The first registrations for substances that were preregistered in 2008 are required in 2010; subsequent registrations are due in 2013 and 2018. New substances that will be manufactured or imported need to be registered prior to being placed on the market (also known as non phase in substances). The company is working on both the 2010 registrations as well as the non phase in registrations. By June 1, 2013, the Commission will review whether substances with endocrine disruptive properties should be authorized if safer alternatives exist. By June 1, 2019, the Commission will determine whether to extend the duty to warn from substances of very high concern to those that could be dangerous or unpleasant. Management does not expect that the costs to comply with REACH will be material to its operations and consolidated financial position. Facility Security DuPont recognizes that the security and safety of its operations are critical to its employees, neighbors and, indeed, to the future of the company. As such, the company has merged chemical site security into its safety core value where it serves as an integral part of its long standing safety culture. Physical security measures have been combined with process safety measures (including the use of inherently safer technology), administrative procedures and emergency response preparedness into an integrated security plan. The company has conducted vulnerability assessments at operating facilities in the U.S. and high priority sites worldwide and identified and implemented appropriate measures to protect these facilities from physical and cyber attacks. DuPont is partnering with carriers, including railroad, shipping and trucking companies, to secure chemicals in transit. In April 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an interim final rule (Rule) that establishes risk-based performance standards for the security of U.S. chemical facilities. Covered chemical facilities are required to prepare Security Vulnerability Assessments that identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement Site Security Plans that include measures satisfying the identified risk-based performance standards. The Rule contains associated provisions addressing inspections and audits, recordkeeping, and the protection of information that constitutes Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information. DHS can seek compliance through the issuance of Orders, including Orders Assessing Civil Penalty and Orders for the Cessation of Operations. In June of 2008 DHS notified those facilities that were preliminarily determined to be covered by the Rule's security requirements. DuPont facilities that were preliminarily determined to be covered conducted and submitted security vulnerability assessments to DHS. Based on its review of these assessments, DHS made final determinations as to which facilities were covered and the risk-base tier into which each falls. These facilities are submitting site security plans to DHS. Once DHS has reviewed and provided preliminary approval of the plans, it will meet with facilities before providing final approval. DuPont has already devoted substantial effort and resources in assessing security vulnerabilities and taking steps to reinforce security at its chemical manufacturing facilities. Until each facility develops and receives DHS approval for its site security plan, specific requirements cannot be determined and considerable uncertainty exists regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, based on guidance issued by DHS regarding its risk-based performance standards, it is expected that new security measures will need to be implemented at the regulated facilities and that total capital costs to implement such measures over the next four years will be about $50 million. PFOA DuPont manufactures fluoropolymer resins and dispersions as well as fluorotelomers, marketing many of them under the Teflon® and Zonyl® brands. All of these products are part of the Performance Chemicals segment. 45 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Fluoropolymer resins and dispersions are high-performance materials with many end uses including architectural fabrics, telecommunications and electronic wiring insulation, automotive fuel systems, computer chip processing equipment, weather-resistant/breathable apparel and non-stick cookware. Fluorotelomers are used to make soil, stain and grease repellants for paper, apparel, upholstery and carpets as well as firefighting foams and coatings. A form of PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) is used as a processing agent to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. For over 50 years, DuPont purchased its PFOA needs from a third party, but beginning in the fall of 2002, it began producing PFOA to support the manufacture of fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. PFOA is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC (DPE) uses PFOA in the manufacture of raw materials to manufacture Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer parts. PFOA is also used in the manufacture of some fluoroelastomers marketed by DPE under the Viton® trademark. The wholly owned subsidiary is a part of the Performance Materials segment. PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. As a result, the EPA initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources of PFOA in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to PFOA is occurring. In 2005, the EPA issued a draft risk assessment on PFOA stating that the cancer data for PFOA may be best described as ""suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential"" under the EPA's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. At EPA's request, the Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed and commented on the scientific soundness of this assessment. In its May 2006 report, the SAB set forth the view, based on laboratory studies in rats, that the human carcinogenic potential of PFOA is more consistent with the Guidelines' descriptor of ""likely to be carcinogenic."" However, the report stated that additional data should be considered before the EPA finalizes its risk assessment of PFOA. The EPA has acknowledged that it will consider additional data, including new research and testing, and has indicated that another SAB review will be sought after the EPA makes its risk assessment. DuPont disputes the cancer classification recommended in the SAB report. Although the EPA has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks associated with PFOA, it also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any products because of concerns about PFOA. DuPont respects the EPA's position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of PFOA and DuPont and other companies have outlined plans to continue research, emission reduction and product stewardship activities to help address the EPA's questions. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to the EPA's 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. In October 2009, (for the year 2008), DuPont reported to the EPA that it had achieved about a 99 percent reduction of PFOA emissions in U.S. manufacturing facilities. The company achieved about a 98 percent reduction in global manufacturing emissions, exceeding the EPA's 2010 objective. DuPont will work individually and with others in the industry to inform EPA's regulatory counterparts in the European Union, Canada, China and Japan about these activities and PFOA in general, including emissions reductions from DuPont's facilities, reformulation of the company's fluoropolymer dispersions and new manufacturing processes for fluorotelomers products. DuPont introduced in late 2006, Echelon™ technology which reduces the PFOA content 99 percent in aqueous fluoropolymer dispersion products. DuPont has converted customers representing over 95 percent of the sales volume for these product lines to newly formulated Echelon™ technology. In February 2007, DuPont announced its commitment to no longer make, use or buy PFOA by 2015, or sooner if possible. DuPont has developed PFOA replacement technology and successfully used this technology in its global manufacturing facilities to produce test materials for all major fluoropolymer product lines. DuPont has begun to supply fluoropolymer products without PFOA to customers for testing in their processes, and is working to obtain appropriate regulatory approvals for this technology. 46 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In the first quarter 2008, DuPont introduced its next generation fluorotelomer products. The products are marketed as DuPont™ Capstone™ products for use in home furnishings, stone and tile, fire fighting foam, fluorosurfactants, textiles and leather goods. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized two new DuPont grease and oil repellents for use in paper packaging. Additional products will be introduced for paper packaging and other end use markets pending appropriate regulatory approvals. In the fourth quarter of 2009, EPA announced the start of a comprehensive approach to enhancing EPA's current chemicals management program under TSCA. As part of this enhancement, EPA released four Existing Chemical Action Plans (the Plans) in December 2009 of which one covers long-chain perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) including PFOA. The Plans outline the risks that the use of the specified chemicals may present and the specific steps that EPA will take to address concerns. EPA indicated that it intends to propose regulatory actions in 2012 to address the potential risks from PFCs, but the specific steps noted in the PFCs Plan are generally consistent with the requirements of the 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. In January 2009, the EPA issued a national Provisional Health Advisory for PFOA of 0.4 parts per billion (ppb) in drinking water. In March 2009, EPA and DuPont entered an Order on Consent under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) reflecting an action level of 0.40 ppb (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In February 2007, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) identified a preliminary drinking-water guidance level for PFOA of 0.04 ppb as part of the first phase of an ongoing process to establish a state drinking-water standard. During the first quarter 2009, the NJDEP began the process to establish a permanent Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for PFOA in drinking water. The process is estimated to take 1 to 2 years. While the NJDEP will continue sampling and evaluation of data from all sources, it has not recommended a change in consumption patterns. Based on extensive health and toxicological studies, DuPont believes that PFOA exposure does not pose a health risk to the general public. Human studies have evaluated many health endpoints across a wide range of exposed populations. While some associations have been reported, no human health effects are known to be caused by PFOA. A considerable number of human health studies are ongoing and results will be available over the next several years. There have not been any regulatory or government actions that prohibit the production or use of PFOA. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be in the future. Products currently manufactured by the company representing approximately $1 billion of 2009 revenues could be affected by any such regulation or prohibition. DuPont has established reserves in connection with certain PFOA environmental and litigation matters (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 47 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. Derivative instruments utilized include forwards, options, futures and swaps. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions and major commodity exchanges. The company hedges certain foreign currency denominated revenues, monetary assets and liabilities, certain business-specific foreign currency exposures and certain energy and agricultural feedstock purchases. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments, accounts receivable and derivatives. As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. As of December 31, 2009, no one individual customer balance represented more than 5 percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses. The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. Foreign Currency Risk The company's objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes. Accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar value of its existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, commitments, and cash flows. The company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are minimized. The company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company's exposure to certain foreign currency-denominated revenues so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar value of the related foreign currency-denominated revenues. The objective of the hedge program is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 48 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, continued The following table summarizes the impacts of this program on the company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, and includes the company's pro rata share of its equity affiliates' exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Pre-tax exchange loss $ (205 ) $ (255 ) $ (85 ) Tax (expense)/benefit 91 83 54 After-tax loss $ (114 ) $ (172 ) $ (31 ) From time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements. Interest Rate Risk The company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed or floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on USD LIBOR. Interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. Commodity Price Risk The company enters into over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. A portion of certain energy feedstock purchases are hedged to reduce price volatility using fixed price swaps and options. The company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory. Under these contracts, growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the market price of grain during the contract period. Derivative instruments having a high correlation to the underlying commodity are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers. The company utilizes derivatives to manage the price volatility of soybean meal. These derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk. Additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sensitivity Analysis The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the market prices or rates that existed at December 31, 49 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, continued 2009 and 2008. The sensitivity for interest rate swaps is based on a one percent change in the market interest rate.

All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the company's strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures and financial results are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events. The company cannot guarantee that these assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized. For some of the important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements see the Risk Factors discussion set forth under Part I, Item 1A beginning on page 6. Overview Vision DuPont's vision is to be the world's most dynamic science company, creating sustainable solutions essential for a better, safer and healthier life for people everywhere. The company is committed to growing shareholder and societal value while reducing its environmental footprint over the long term. Strategy The company's strategy for growth is to use science-based solutions to address four fundamental global trends – Increasing Food Production, Decreasing Dependency on Fossil Fuels, Protecting People and the Environment, and Growth in Developing Markets. The company believes it best serves its shareholders by increasing its global presence in meeting challenges, including increasing food production, increasing renewable sources for energy and raw materials, and providing greater safety and protection for people and the environment. For these strategic areas, the company has set differentiated targets for growth and future funding for capital expenditures, research and development, and marketing programs. Acquisition of Danisco The financial goals discussed below exclude the impact of the intended acquisition of Danisco. The acquisition is aligned with the company's growth strategy and complimentary to the company's existing businesses and research and development pipelines. The transaction is expected to be cash and earnings accretive in 2012, the first full year of the combined entity. Upon completion, the transaction would establish DuPont as a clear leader in industrial biotechnology with science-intensive innovations that address global challenges in food production and reduced fossil fuel consumption. Goals By aggressively pursuing top line growth opportunities in key markets and improving productivity, the company met or surpassed its 2010 financial goals for sales growth, earnings per share, cash flow and working capital reductions. Consistent with its strong 2010 performance, the company announced a new five-year plan which includes compound annual growth targets of 7 percent for sales and 12 percent for earnings per share from 2010 through 2015. Sales in developing markets, which include China, India, and the countries located in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, are targeted to make up 36 percent of the company's sales by 2015, a 4 percentage point increase from 2010. Additionally, the company continues to execute its three-year 2010-2012 plan announced in 2009, which includes $1 billion fixed cost productivity actions and $1 billion working capital productivity programs. The company also reaffirmed its commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to shareholders unless there is a compelling opportunity to invest for growth. 16 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of Operations (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 NET SALES $ 31,505 $ 26,109 $ 30,529 2010 versus 2009 Consolidated net sales for 2010 were $31.5 billion, up 21 percent. This increase reflects 17 percent higher sales volume, a 5 percent increase in local selling prices, and a 1 percent net reduction from portfolio changes. Sales volume was higher across all segments with volume improving 13 percent in the United States and 19 percent outside the United States. Sales in developing markets of $10.2 billion improved 27 percent from 2009, and the percentage of total company sales in these markets increased to 32 percent from 31 percent. The table below shows a regional breakdown of 2010 consolidated net sales based on location of customers and percentage variances from prior year: Percent Change Due to: (Dollars in billions) 2010 Net Sales Percent Change vs. 2009 Local Price Currency Effect Volume Portfolio Worldwide $ 31.5 21 5 - 17 (1 ) United States 11.5 17 5 - 13 (1 ) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) 8.1 14 4 (3 ) 13 - Asia Pacific 7.3 40 6 2 33 (1 ) Latin America 3.7 17 4 2 13 (2 ) Canada 0.9 20 3 9 9 (1 ) 2009 versus 2008 Consolidated net sales for 2009 were $26.1 billion, down 14 percent. This reflects 12 percent lower volume, a 1 percent increase in local selling prices, and 3 percent unfavorable currency exchange. The full year worldwide sales volume decline reflects decreases in every region for the first 9 months of the year, partly offset by year over year volume increases in certain markets during the fourth quarter. Sales in developing markets of $8 billion declined 9 percent from 2008, while the percentage of total company sales in these markets increased to 31 percent. 17 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7.

Offsetting the reduction of Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income was a decrease in net pre-tax exchange losses of $192 million combined with higher income from equity affiliates of $93 million, an increase in net gains on sales of assets of $64 million, a benefit of $59 million in 2010 related to accrued interest associated with settlements of prior year income tax contingencies, an increase in insurance recoveries of $41 million and a $31 million combined benefit from an acquisition and an early termination of a supply agreement. 2009 versus 2008 Other income, net, decreased $88 million versus 2008. The decrease was attributable to a $47 million reduction in interest income due to lower interest rates in 2009 partially offset by higher interest from increased cash and customer deferred receivables, and the absence of a $51 million favorable litigation settlement in 2008. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $23 million in asset sales. Additional information related to the company's other income, net is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OTHER OPERATING CHARGES $ 23,146 $ 19,708 $ 23,548 As a percent of net sales 73 % 75 % 77 % 2010 versus 2009 Cost of goods sold and other operating charges (COGS) for the year 2010 was $23.1 billion, versus $19.7 billion in 2009, an increase of 17 percent. COGS was 73 percent of net sales, a 2 percentage point decrease from prior year. The improvement principally reflects increased manufacturing utilization and higher selling prices that more than offset increases in raw material costs. Higher selling prices increased sales $1.3 billion, while raw material, energy and freight costs, adjusted for volume and currency, were up 6 percent, or $0.7 billion. 18 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2009 versus 2008 COGS for the year 2009 was $19.7 billion, versus $23.5 billion in 2008, a decrease of 16 percent. COGS was 75 percent of net sales for 2009 versus 77 percent for the year 2008. The 2 percentage point decrease principally reflects a $1.1 billion decrease in the combined costs for raw materials, energy and freight and the absence of a $227 million charge for hurricane-related cleanup and repair in 2008, partially offset by significantly lower capacity utilization and an unfavorable currency impact. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES $ 3,669 $ 3,440 $ 3,593 As a percent of net sales 12 % 13 % 12 % 2010 versus 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $229 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. The 2010 increase was due to higher selling expenses, primarily in the Agriculture & Nutrition segment as a result of increased global commissions and selling and marketing investments related to the company's seed products, and higher non-cash pension expenses. 2009 versus 2008 SG&A decreased $153 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The 2009 decrease was principally due to strict cost controls and was partially offset by higher SG&A in the Agriculture & Nutrition segment as a result of increased global commissions and selling and marketing investments related to the company's seed products.

In addition, R&D increased due to higher non-cash pension expenses and a $50 million charge for an upfront payment related to a Pioneer licensing agreement for corn seed trait technology. See Pioneer business discussion beginning on page 26 for additional information. 2009 versus 2008 R&D was down in 2009 versus 2008, excluding the Agriculture & Nutrition segment, due to strict cost controls. Higher R&D expense in the Agriculture & Nutrition segment in 2009 related to accelerated biotechnology trait research and development activity. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 INTEREST EXPENSE $ 590 $ 408 $ 376 Interest expense increased $182 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the $179 pre-tax charge on the early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter 2010. The $32 increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to higher average borrowings, partially offset by slightly lower average interest rates. 19 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7.

See below for further details on these programs. 2009 Restructuring Program In second quarter 2009, in response to the global economic recession, the company committed to an initiative to address the steep and extended downturn in motor vehicle and construction markets, and the extension of the downturn into industrial markets. The plan was designed to restructure asset and fixed cost bases in order to improve long-term competitiveness, simplify business processes, and maximize pre-tax operating income. The plan included the elimination of about 2,000 positions by severance principally located in the U.S. As a result, a charge of $340 million was recorded in employee separation/asset related charges, net which pertains to the following financial statement line items: COGS – 60 percent, SG&A – 30 percent, and R&D – 10 percent. This charge included $212 million of severance and related benefits costs, $24 million of other non-personnel charges and $104 million of asset-related charges, including $77 million for asset shut downs and write-offs, $11 million for asset impairments and $16 million for accelerated depreciation. In the fourth quarter 2009, the company recorded a $30 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2009 restructuring program. Additionally, the company recorded a $20 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2009 restructuring program in the fourth quarter 2010. These reductions primarily related to lower than estimated individual severance costs and work force reductions through non-severance programs. The actions related to the 2009 restructuring program were substantially completed by the end of 2010 with payments continuing into 2011, primarily in Europe. 2008 Restructuring Program During 2008, in response to the challenging economic environment, the company initiated a global restructuring program to reduce costs and improve profitability across its businesses. The 2008 restructuring program included the elimination of approximately 2,500 positions principally located in Western Europe and the U.S. primarily supporting the motor vehicle and construction markets. In 2008, the company recorded a charge of $535 million, which included $287 million related to employee severance costs and $248 million attributable to asset shut-downs, asset impairments and other non-personnel charges. In 2009, the company recorded a $100 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2008 restructuring program. Additionally, the company recorded a $14 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2008 restructuring program in the fourth quarter 2010. These reductions primarily related to lower than estimated individual severance costs and workforce reductions through non-severance programs. The program and payments related to the 2008 restructuring program were substantially completed by the end of 2010. Additional details related to these programs are contained in the individual segment reviews and in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 20 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES $ 659 $ 415 $ 381 Effective income tax rate 17.8 % 19.0 % 15.9 % In 2010, the company recorded a tax provision of $659 million, reflecting an increase from 2009, largely due to an increase in pre-tax earnings and the impact associated with the company's policy of hedging the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. These are partially offset by net tax benefits of $49 million related to the adjustment of income tax accruals associated with settlements of prior year tax contingencies and $39 million for reversal of tax valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. The decrease in the 2010 effective tax rate compared to 2009 was primarily due to favorable geographic mix of pre-tax earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions and the net tax benefits noted above. In 2009, the company recorded a tax provision of $415 million reflecting a marginal increase from 2008. The increase in the 2009 effective tax rate compared to 2008 was primarily due to geographic mix of earnings. The company's current estimate of the 2011 effective income tax rate is about 20-21 percent, excluding tax effects of exchange gains and losses which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the provision for income taxes, as well as items that significantly impact the company's effective tax rate. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DUPONT $ 3,031 $ 1,755 $ 2,007 2010 versus 2009 Net income attributable to DuPont (""earnings"") for 2010 increased $1.3 billion, or 73 percent versus 2009. The increase principally reflects higher sales volume and selling prices and the absence of a prior year restructuring charge, partly offset by higher non-cash pension costs and lower Pharmaceuticals income. See additional information above related to changes in earnings. 2009 versus 2008 Earnings for 2009 decreased $252 million, or 13 percent versus 2008. The decrease in earnings was principally attributable to lower sales volume, unfavorable currency impacts, and higher non-cash pension costs. Partly offsetting these factors were lower costs for raw materials, energy, and freight, benefits from cost reductions and productivity actions, lower restructuring charges, and the absence of prior year hurricane-related charges. See additional information above related to changes in earnings. Corporate Outlook For the year 2011, the company's earnings outlook is a range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share with expected sales between $33 billion to $34 billion, reflecting the expectation for continued steady global economic growth with increasing industrial production, favorable North American agricultural conditions and the company's further penetration of developing markets. Earnings from Pharmaceuticals are expected to decline about $290 million pre-tax, reflecting the expiration of certain patents for Cozaar®/Hyzaar®. The company expects higher operating costs from an estimated four to five percent increase in raw material, energy and freight costs, and approximately $60 million higher pre-tax non-cash pension costs. The company plans to partly offset these increases by fixed cost productivity programs totaling about $300 million. The company plans to continue a differential level of capital expenditures and funding for research & development for businesses expected to have above-average growth rates and margins. For 2011, targets have been set for capital expenditures totaling about $1.8 billion, and working capital productivity improvements totaling $300 million. The outlook above excludes the impact of the planned Danisco acquisition which could reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share. 21 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Critical Accounting Estimates The company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, restructuring liabilities, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represents some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Long-term Employee Benefits Accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions annually as of December 31st. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan obligations or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees. About 80 percent of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. The company utilizes published long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate at measurement date. Where commonly available, the company considers indices of various durations to reflect the timing of future benefit payments. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plans' assets. In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. The market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan: Principal U.S. Pension Plan (Dollars in billions) 2010 2009 2008 Market-related value of assets $ 13.9 $ 14.0 $ 16.2 Fair value of plan assets $ 14.8 $ 13.9 $ 13.5 22 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is typically determined using the fair value of assets. The fair value of assets in all pension plans was $18.4 billion at December 31, 2010, and the related projected benefit obligations were $23.9 billion. In addition, obligations under the company's unfunded other long-term employee benefit plans were $4.0 billion at December 31, 2010. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and other long-term employee benefit plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010: Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge) (Dollars in millions) 1/2 Percentage Point Increase 1/2 Percentage Point Decrease Discount Rate $ 81 $ (88 ) Expected rate of return on plan assets 84 (84 ) Additional information with respect to pension and other long-term employee benefits expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-Term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 40 and in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Matters DuPont accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs at multiparty sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. The company has recorded a liability of $407 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010; these accrued liabilities exclude claims against third parties and are not discounted. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued. Much of this liability results from the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, often referred to as the Superfund), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and similar state and global laws. These laws require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where the company conducts or once conducted operations or at sites where company-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites identified by the company for which it is probable that environmental remediation will be required, but which are not currently the subject of enforcement activities. Federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations and could, among other things, impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from company-generated waste disposal. Over the next two decades, the company could incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site. These activities and their associated costs, depend on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, as well as the presence or absence of PRPs. Therefore, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. Legal Contingencies The company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of 23 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company's global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant, however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations these changes could be material. At December 31, 2010, the company had a deferred tax asset balance of $6.4 billion, net of valuation allowance of $1.7 billion. Realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets. Valuation of Assets Assessment of the potential impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and investments in affiliates is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified businesses operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. 24 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Based on the results of the company's annual goodwill impairment test in 2010, no impairments exist at this time. The company's methodology for estimating the fair value of its businesses is using the income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction analyses. There can be no assurance that the company's estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flow and revenue and operating income growth rates made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Information with respect to the company's significant accounting policies on long-lived assets is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Reviews Segment sales include transfers to another business segment. Products are transferred between segments on a basis intended to reflect, as nearly as practicable, the market value of the products. Segment pre-tax operating income (loss) (PTOI) is defined as operating income before income taxes, exchange gains (losses), corporate expenses and interest. A reconciliation of segment sales to consolidated net sales and segment PTOI to income before income taxes for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is included in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company initiated global restructuring programs during 2009 and 2008. The 2009 and 2008 program charges reduced total segment PTOI for 2009 and 2008 by $340 million and $535 million, respectively. In 2009, the company recorded a $30 million and $100 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2009 program and 2008 programs, respectively. In 2010, the company recorded a $20 million and $14 million net reduction in the estimated costs associated with the 2009 program and 2008 programs, respectively. Below is a summary of the net impact to each segment related to the activities described above: 2010 (Charges) and Credits 2009 (Charges) and Credits 2008 (Charge) (Dollars in millions) 2009 and 2008 Net Program Reductions 2009 Program 2009 Net Program Reductions 2008 Net Program Reductions 2009 Net Impact 2008 Program Agriculture & Nutrition $ - $ - $ - $ 1 $ 1 $ (18 ) Electronics & Communications 8 (43 ) 6 - (37 ) (37 ) Performance Chemicals 10 (66 ) 9 3 (54 ) (50 ) Performance Coatings (6 ) (65 ) (11 ) 61 (15 ) (209 ) Performance Materials 16 (110 ) 23 29 (58 ) (94 ) Safety & Protection 5 (55 ) 8 2 (45 ) (96 ) Other 1 (1 ) (5 ) 4 (2 ) (31 ) Total (Charge) Credit $ 34 $ (340 ) $ 30 $ 100 $ (210 ) $ (535 ) 25 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued AGRICULTURE & NUTRITION Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2010 $ 9.1 $ 1,355 2009 $ 8.3 $ 1,224 2008 $ 8.0 $ 1,087 Agriculture & Nutrition's businesses leverage the company's technology, customer relationships, and industry knowledge to improve the quantity, quality and safety of the global food supply and the global production agriculture industry. Land available for worldwide agricultural production is increasingly limited so production growth will need to be achieved principally through improving crop yields and productivity rather than through increases in planted area. The segment's businesses deliver a broad portfolio of products and services that are specifically targeted to achieve gains in crop yields and productivity, including Pioneer® brand seed products and well-established brands of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. The segment's businesses operate across the food value chain from inputs for producing agriculture products to global production and distribution of soy-based food ingredients to food quality diagnostic testing equipment. Research and development focuses on leveraging technology to increase grower productivity and enhance the value of grains and soy through improved seed traits, superior seed germplasm and effective use of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. The following are Agriculture & Nutrition's operating businesses: Pioneer is the world's leading seed brand and a world leader in improving crop yields with hybrid and varietal seeds that improve grower yields and provide effective plant insect protection and herbicide tolerance. The principal products of Pioneer are hybrid seed corn and varietal soybean seed, as well as sunflower, canola, sorghum and rice. Crops grown from Pioneer seed are used to meet the global demand for animal feed, food, biofuels, and fiber. Sales of Pioneer seeds amounted to 17 percent, 18 percent and 13 percent of the company's total consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Agricultural seed research requires long-term commitment, investment and innovation. Pioneer research is focused on results that deliver higher crop yields and a consistent per acre income advantage for its customers. New product innovation is accomplished through an effective integration of superior germplasm and value added native and biotechnology traits. In 2010, Pioneer benefited from the North America launch of new soybean varieties and new Pioneer® brand corn hybrids. In April 2010, Pioneer received EPA cultivation approval of Optimum® AcreMax™ 1 products, the first product with reduced and integrated corn rootworm refuge with 2011 commercialization in North America. In October 2010, Pioneer received EPA cultivation approval of Optimum® Intrasect™ insect protection products offering that will allow U.S. corn growers to reduce their structured above ground refuge to a level of 5 percent in the Corn Belt. Optimum® Intrasect™ insect protection products will be demonstrated to growers in 2011. Pioneer expects EPA cultivation approval for its next generation integrated refuge insect control products in the second half 2011. These innovative and convenient products would feature single-bag reduced refuge for both corn rootworm and corn borer. Upon EPA cultivation approval, multiple product versions would be available for grower choice including but not limited to: Optimum® AcreMaxTM products for above-ground protection and Optimum® AcreMaxTM Xtra products for above- and below-ground protection. In December 2010, Pioneer and Syngenta AG (Syngenta) entered into an agreement to grant Pioneer a non-exclusive, global license to Syngenta's corn rootworm trait MIR604 (Agrisure™ RW) for corn seed. The trait provides protection from below-ground coleopteran insects, including corn rootworm, a major corn pest in the U.S. and around the world. The license gives Pioneer the right to commercialize corn seed containing MIR604, including the right to stack MIR604 with other traits through the expiration of the relevant patents. As part of the agreement, Pioneer is obligated to make milestone and royalty payments assuming certain contingencies, including regulatory approvals, are met. The contingencies related to the first milestone payment are expected to be met in 2011. Minimum payments under the agreement are expected to total about $400 million over the next several years. In September 2010, as part of the company's strategy to deliver innovations that address the need for increased food production to feed the world's growing population, Pioneer announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire 26 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued a majority share of Pannar Seed Limited, a South African-based seed company. This investment would allow each business to access additional crop areas, reach more customers and deliver improved seed products quicker than either can do on its own. In December 2010, the South African Competition Commission rejected the acquisition. The company has appealed this decision and expects to receive a final decision in 2011. As announced in December 2008, Pioneer is expanding its reach in North America through its PROaccessSM business strategy in order to bring its seed genetics to more customers. Under the PROaccessSM business strategy, nine companies distribute products on behalf of Pioneer that are co-branded using Pioneer-owned brands together with one of the nine companies' brands. Since launching PROaccessSM, six of the nine PROaccessSM partners have become wholly owned subsidiaries of the company. In the spring 2009, Monsanto sued the company in U.S. District Court claiming that stacking seed with Pioneer's Optimum® GAT® trait and Monsanto's Roundup Ready®1 herbicide tolerance trait violates its Roundup Ready® license agreements with Monsanto. Monsanto also alleges that sales of Pioneer stacked seeds would infringe a Monsanto patent that expires in 2014. Monsanto seeks declaratory relief, unspecified damages and a permanent injunction to prevent sales of Optimum® GAT®/ Roundup Ready® stacked seeds. DuPont filed an answer and counterclaims, including patent misuse and antitrust claims. In January 2010, the Court ruled that the license agreements between the companies contain an unwritten (""implied"") term that prohibits stacking these traits. The Court vacated its ruling regarding the ""implied term"" in the third quarter 2010, and concluded that the license neither expressly prohibits nor expressly grants the right to stack a second glyphosate tolerance trait with Monsanto's Roundup Ready® trait. The company's separate antitrust and patent fraud claims were not impacted by either ruling and are proceeding. Pioneer continues to develop soybean seed in which these traits are stacked and sales could occur between 2013-2014, subject to regulatory approvals. Neither ruling changes Pioneer's commercialization plans for products with the Optimum® GAT® trait. Furthermore, management believes that the Monsanto lawsuit is unlikely to adversely affect the company's commercial results for soybean and corn seed because Pioneer can continue to sell seed with Roundup Ready® traits that are not stacked with Optimum® GAT® traits. 1Registered Trademark of Monsanto DuPont Crop Protection serves the global production agriculture industry with crop protection products for field crops such as wheat, corn, soybean and rice; specialty crops such as fruit, nut, vine and vegetables; and non-crop segments, including forestry and land management. Principal crop protection products are weed control, disease control, and insect control products. The sales growth of the business' insect control portfolio is led by Rynaxypyr®, a product registered for sale in over 60 countries and sold under four key brands for use across a broad range of core agricultural crops. The business continues to expand its product offerings in the professional pest control, lawn care, golf course, animal health and seed treatment markets. Nutrition & Health operates principally within the specialty food ingredients market, including soy proteins and lecithins through the Solae Company, a majority-owned venture with Bunge Limited. Nutrition & Health global production and distribution capabilities serves various areas within the food industries including meat and poultry products, consumer food products, dairy-alternative products and nutritional products. Nutrition & Health anticipates improved volume growth through offerings in its specialty food ingredients. 2010 versus 2009 Sales were $9.1 billion, a 10 percent increase versus the prior year, reflecting a 7 percent increase in volume and 4 percent higher United States dollar (USD) selling prices, which were partially offset by portfolio changes of 1 percent. Higher volume was primarily due to higher seed sales in North America with market share gains for corn and soybeans. Higher global sales of Crop Protection products were led by broad-based recovery across most regions and strong demand for Rynaxypyr® in Asia Pacific and Latin America. The higher USD selling prices reflect higher value product mix and pricing actions to offset the increase in raw material costs. PTOI for 2010 was $1.4 billion, an increase of 11 percent versus the prior year, principally due to the higher sales volume, partially offset by higher spending for growth investments and a $50 million charge in R&D expense for an upfront payment related to a Pioneer licensing agreement for corn seed trait technology, as described above. 27 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2009 versus 2008 Sales were $8.3 billion, a 4 percent increase when compared to 2008, reflecting 5 percent higher USD selling prices, partially offset by a 1 percent decrease in volume. The higher USD selling prices is related to Pioneer seeds and Crop Protection proprietary insect, weed and disease control products, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts in Europe, Canada and Latin America, as well as the impact of significantly lower market-driven pricing for glyphosate resale. The decrease in volume was primarily due to lower sales of Crop Protection disease and insect control products, and lower sales of Nutrition & Health products largely offset by higher Pioneer corn and soybean seed sales market share gains in North America. PTOI was $1.2 billion, an increase of 13 percent versus 2008, principally due to the higher sales and higher value product mix, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts globally. Outlook The segment anticipates sales and earnings growth in 2011. Segment earnings are expected to benefit in particular from continued strong momentum in the Pioneer corn and soybean business. Pioneer anticipates continued growth in volume in key corn and soybean markets including the U.S., Canada and Latin America, as well as value-based pricing gains. The 2011 product line up will include new corn hybrids and soybean varieties as well as Optimum® AcreMax™ 1 products, the industry's first product with reduced and integrated corn rootworm refuge. In the Crop Protection business, volume driven sales growth combined with continued productivity and business improvement actions are expected to contribute to earnings in 2011. Volume growth is underpinned by a favorable industry outlook, continued regional expansion and new market segment penetration of products such as Rynxypyr® as well as new product introductions such as Streamline® herbicide for land management. In the Nutrition & Health business, volume growth reflecting soy protein penetration and expansion of health and wellness products coupled with continued and intensified productivity actions are anticipated to support earnings and margin expansion. ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATIONS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2010 $ 2.8 $ 445 2009 $ 1.9 $ 87 2008 $ 2.2 $ 251 Electronics & Communications is a leading supplier of differentiated materials and systems for photovoltaics, consumer electronics, displays and advanced printing that enable superior performance and lower total cost of ownership for customers. The segment leverages DuPont's strong materials and technology base to target attractive growth opportunities in photovoltaic materials, materials for circuit and semiconductor fabrication and packaging, display materials, packaging graphics, and ink-jet printing. In the fast growing photovoltaics market, the company continues to be a leading supplier of metallization pastes and backsheet materials for use in solar cells and modules. In 2010, DuPont Apollo Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, started providing total system solutions and production of high-efficiency tandem thin-film photovoltaic modules to meet the needs of this fast growing segment of the solar energy market. Beyond photovoltaics, the segment is investing in its broad portfolio of materials for semiconductor fabrication and packaging, as well as innovative materials for circuit applications, to address critical needs of electronic component and device manufacturers. In the displays market, the segment continues to be a leading materials supplier for plasma displays. In addition, the segment continues to invest in developing a solution-process technology and material set to enable lower cost organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. In packaging graphics, DuPont is a leading supplier of flexographic printing systems, including Cyrel® photopolymer plates. The segment is investing in new products such as Cyrel® FAST Round to strengthen its market leadership position in advanced printing markets. DuPont is also expanding its leadership position in black-pigmented inks and developing new color-pigmented inks for network printing applications. 28 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The segment is on track to complete a $295 million expansion to support the DuPont Tedlar® polyvinyl fluoride films business. This includes a $120 million investment in capacity expansion to produce the raw materials that make the film, which was completed in 2010. A multi-phase $175 million investment of high-performance Tedlar® PV2001 series oriented film production is scheduled for completion in 2011. Tedlar® films serve as the critical component of photovoltaic module backsheets, providing long-term durability and performance in all weather conditions. 2010 versus 2009 Sales of $2.8 billion were up 44 percent, reflecting 37 percent higher volume and 7 percent higher USD selling prices. Higher volume was driven by strong growth in all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific and Europe, and strong demand across most market segments, particularly in photovoltaics. Higher USD selling prices were primarily due to pass-through of higher precious metals prices. PTOI was $445 million compared to $87 million in the prior year. The increase in PTOI was driven by substantially higher volume, improved productivity and the absence of a net $37 million restructuring charge in the prior year. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $1.9 billion were down 13 percent, reflecting 11 percent volume decline and 2 percent lower USD selling prices. The lower volume reflects the impact of the global economic recession which affected sales for products across all key markets. Sales volume improved throughout 2009, most significantly in Asia Pacific, where sales were essentially flat when compared to 2008. The lower USD selling prices were mainly due to contractual pass-through of lower precious metal prices. PTOI was $87 million compared to $251 million in 2008. The decline in PTOI was primarily due to the impact of lower sales, lower income from affiliates, and higher charges associated with low capacity utilization of production lines. Outlook For 2011, sales of products into photovoltaics, consumer electronics, displays, and advanced printing markets are expected to increase moderately. The segment continues to make productivity and supply chain improvements, as well as capacity investments to meet global demand. Segment earnings are expected to increase reflecting the impact of higher volume and productivity initiatives, as well as investments for growth. PERFORMANCE CHEMICALS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2010 $ 6.3 $ 1,081 2009 $ 5.0 $ 547 2008 $ 6.0 $ 687 Performance Chemicals businesses deliver customized solutions with a wide range of industrial and specialty chemical products for markets including plastics & coatings, textiles, mining, pulp and paper, water treatment and healthcare. The following are Performance Chemicals' operating businesses: DuPont Titanium Technologies is the world's largest manufacturer of titanium dioxide, and is dedicated to creating greater, more rewarding value for the coatings, paper, plastics, specialties and minerals markets through service, brand, and product. The business' main products include its broad line of DuPont™ Ti-Pure® titanium dioxide products. DuPont Chemicals and Fluoroproducts is a leading global manufacturer of industrial and specialty fluorochemicals, fluoropolymers, and performance chemicals. The business' broad line of products that include refrigerants, lubricants, propellants, solvents, fire extinguishants and electronic gases, cover a wide range of industries and markets. Key brands include DuPontTM Teflon®, Dymel®, Isceon®, Suva®, Vertrel®, Zyron®, Vazo® and Virkon®. 2010 versus 2009 Sales of $6.3 billion were 27 percent higher than last year, reflecting 18 percent higher volume and 10 percent higher USD selling prices, which were partially offset by portfolio changes of 1 percent. Broad-based market recovery led to sales increases in all markets and all regions, most significant in Asia Pacific, reflecting strong demand for titanium dioxide, fluoropolymers and refrigerants, with continuing adoption of ISCEON® as a preferred retrofit to R22 29 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued refrigerant. Higher USD selling prices reflect favorable pricing for titanium dioxide and pass-through of higher raw material costs for industrial chemicals and fluoroproducts. PTOI was $1,081 million as compared to $547 million in the prior year. The increase in PTOI was driven by higher volume, higher USD selling prices that more than offset increases in raw material costs, improved productivity and the absence of a net $54 million restructuring charge in the prior year. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $5.0 billion were 18 percent lower than 2008, due to a 12 percent decline in volume and 6 percent lower USD selling prices. The lower volume principally reflects decreased demand for industrial chemicals and fluoroproducts across all regions reflecting the impact of the economic downturn. Sales of titanium dioxide products recovered during the second half 2009, and were higher than the pre-recession levels in the second half 2007. The lower USD selling prices were mainly due to contractual pass-through of lower raw material prices and unfavorable currency impact in Europe and Asia Pacific. PTOI was $547 million as compared to $687 million in 2008. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the impact of lower volume, partially offset by fixed costs reductions. Outlook Performance Chemicals' sales are expected to increase in 2011 as a result of the continued global economic recovery, higher global demand for titanium dioxide and specialty chemicals, and higher USD selling prices. Total segment earnings are also expected to increase consistent with the higher sales volume, higher USD selling prices and improved fixed cost productivity. This segment manufactures products that could be affected by uncertainties associated with PFOA matters. See the discussion on page 46 under the subheading PFOA for further information. PERFORMANCE COATINGS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2010 $ 3.8 $ 249 2009 $ 3.4 $ 69 2008 $ 4.4 $ (8 ) Performance Coatings is one of the world's leading motor vehicle coatings suppliers. Products offered include high performance liquid and powder coatings for motor vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the motor vehicle after-market, and general industrial applications, such as coatings for heavy equipment, pipes and appliances and electrical insulation. After-market coatings products are marketed using the DuPont™ Standox®, Spies Hecker® and Nason® brand names. Standox® and Spies Hecker® are focused on the high-end motor vehicle after-markets, while Nason® is primarily focused on economy coating applications. In 2009 and 2008, the segment experienced a significant decline in sales, mainly in the OEMs markets, due to the impact of the global economic recession in the automotive industry. In addition, the North American automotive industry continued to experience structural changes, including the loss of U.S. market share by U.S. automakers. In 2009, the global production of automobiles and light trucks declined by 14 percent reflecting declines of 33 percent in North America, and 10 percent in the rest of the world, which was partially offset by an increase in production of 44 percent in Greater China. In 2010, the segment experienced strong recovery from the economic downturn across most markets and regions. Global automotive markets experienced increased production levels due to improved OEM auto builds as a result of higher demand, most significant in North America and Europe. Automotive builds across the globe increased 22 percent, reflecting an improvement of 37 percent in North America and 20 percent in the rest of the world. The industry production forecast for 2011 projects a global increase of 5 percent, reflecting continued recovery in North America and continued growth in Asia Pacific. 30 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2010 versus 2009 Sales of $3.8 billion were up 11 percent when compared to prior year, reflecting 9 percent higher volume and a 2 percent increase in USD selling prices. Higher volume reflects recovery in global automotive OEM markets as a result of higher global motor vehicle builds and strong demand in industrial coatings, particularly in the North American and European heavy duty truck markets. Higher USD selling prices primarily reflect pricing actions taken to offset the increase in raw material costs. PTOI was $249 million as compared to $69 million in 2009. The increase in PTOI primarily reflects the impact of higher volume, improved productivity and higher USD selling prices, which were partially offset by higher raw material costs. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $3.4 billion were down 21 percent when compared to 2008, reflecting a 20 percent decline in volume and 1 percent lower USD selling prices. The decline in volume reflects the impact of fewer motor vehicle and industrial truck builds of motor vehicle OEMs, and lower sales of industrial and after-market products in all regions. Sales to OEMs improved substantially during the second half 2009, mostly due to the impact of government incentives programs and higher sales in Asia Pacific. Sales of after-market and industrial coatings experienced a slower recovery from the inventory destocking experienced in the industry during the fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009. The lower USD selling prices reflect unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by higher local selling prices. PTOI was $69 million as compared to a loss of $8 million in 2008. The improvement in PTOI was primarily due to lower fixed costs, and the net year-over-year impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities, partially offset by the effect of lower volume. Outlook For 2011, the segment expects sales to increase modestly with continued recovery in the global automotive and heavy duty truck markets and market growth in the developing regions. PTOI is expected to improve due to continued productivity efforts and higher sales in all regions. PERFORMANCE MATERIALS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2010 $ 6.3 $ 994 2009 $ 4.8 $ 287 2008 $ 6.4 $ 128 Performance Materials' businesses provide productive, higher performance polymers, elastomers, films, parts, and systems and solutions which improve the uniqueness, functionality and profitability of its customers' offerings.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2010 versus 2009 Sales of $6.3 billion were 32 percent higher than prior year, reflecting 27 percent higher volume and a 7 percent increase in USD selling prices, which were partially offset by portfolio changes of 2 percent. The higher volume was led by broad-based demand across all markets, particularly in automotive and electronic markets, with strong volume recovery in all regions, led by Asia Pacific. Higher USD selling prices were a combination of stronger product sales mix and higher USD selling prices in response to higher feedstock costs. 2010 PTOI was $994 million compared to $287 million in 2009. The increase in PTOI was primarily driven by higher sales volume, higher USD selling prices and improved productivity. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $4.8 billion were 26 percent lower reflecting 18 percent lower volume, 6 percent decrease in USD selling prices, and a 2 percent reduction related to portfolio changes. The decrease in volume mainly reflects the effect of the global economic recession and the inventory destocking experienced during the first half 2009. However, sales continuously improved during the second half 2009, both sequentially and when compared to 2008, mainly due to overall economic recovery and higher sales to the motor vehicle industry. The lower USD selling prices were a combination of significantly weaker product sales mix, unfavorable currency impacts, and for certain products, lower USD selling prices in response to lower feedstock costs. 2009 PTOI was $287 million compared to $128 million in 2008. The improvement in PTOI reflects the impact of lower raw material, energy and freight costs, lower fixed costs, the absence of a $216 million hurricane-related charge in 2008, an $82 million benefit in 2009 from hurricane-related insurance recoveries and a reduction in the hurricane-related accrual, and the net year over year impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities. As of December 31, 2010, the company is aggressively pursuing additional insurance recoveries in the range of $50 – $100 million. Outlook 2011 sales are expected to grow due to anticipated increases in global motor vehicle OEMs builds and continued strength, particularly in Asia Pacific, for most of the markets served by the segment. PTOI is also expected to improve due to the impact of higher sales, improved fixed cost productivity and market-driven innovations for products and processes. SAFETY & PROTECTION Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2010 $ 3.4 $ 454 2009 $ 2.8 $ 260 2008 $ 3.7 $ 661 Safety & Protection's businesses satisfy the growing global needs of businesses, governments and consumers for solutions that make life safer, healthier and more secure. By uniting market-driven science with the strength of highly regarded brands, the segment delivers products and services to a large number of markets including, construction, transportation, communications, industrial chemicals, oil and gas, electric utilities, automotive, manufacturing, defense, homeland security and safety consulting. The following are Safety & Protection's operating businesses: Protection Technologies is focused on finding solutions to protect people and the environment. With products like DuPontTM Kevlar®, Nomex® and Tyvek®, the business continues to hold strong positions in life protection markets and meet the continued demand for body armor and personal protective gear for the military, law enforcement personnel, firefighters and other first responders, as well as for workers in the oil and gas industry around the world. Building Innovations is committed to the building science behind increasing the performance of building systems, helping reduce operating costs and creating more sustainable structures. The business is a market leader of solid surfaces through its Corian® and Montelli® lines of products which offer durable and versatile materials for residential and commercial purposes. Other products such as Tyvek® and Typar® offer leading solutions for the protection and energy efficiency of buildings. 32 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Sustainable Solutions continues to help organizations worldwide reduce workplace injuries and fatalities while improving operating costs, productivity and quality. Sustainable Solutions is a leader in the safety consulting field, selling training products, as well as consulting services. Additionally, Sustainable Solutions is dedicated to clean air, clean fuel and clean water with offerings that help reduce sulfur and other emissions, formulate cleaner fuels, or dispose of liquid waste. Its goal is to help maintain business continuity and environmental compliance for companies in the refining and petrochemical industries, as well as for government entities. In 2010, the business completed the acquisition of MECS, Inc., which is a leading global provider of process technology, proprietary specialty equipment and technical services to the sulfuric acid industry. The acquisition allows the business to expand its clean technologies portfolio by strengthening the business' clean air and clean fuel offerings and provide the company with further access to high-growth market segments, particularly in developing regions like Asia Pacific. 2010 versus 2009 Sales of $3.4 billion were 20 percent higher than last year, due to higher volume. The increase in volume reflects strong recovery and increased demand across all regions, led by Europe and Asia Pacific, and markets, particularly in aramid and nonwoven products. Further penetration in the U.S. commercial construction markets led to higher sales as recovery in global construction markets remained weak. Sales for consulting and training services improved modestly across most regions, led by Asia Pacific. PTOI was $454 million compared to $260 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher volume and the absence of a net $45 million restructuring charge in prior year, partially offset by higher spending for growth initiatives and higher raw material costs. 2009 versus 2008 Sales of $2.8 billion were 25 percent lower than 2008, due to a 23 percent decline in volume and 3 percent lower USD selling prices, partially offset by a 1 percent increase from portfolio changes. The lower volume reflects decreased demand for products across all markets and regions due to the impact of the economic downturn. The lower USD selling prices were mainly due to unfavorable currency impact in Europe and Asia Pacific. PTOI was $260 million compared to $661 million in 2008. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to the impact of lower volume and charges associated with low capacity utilization of production units, partially offset by fixed costs reductions. Outlook For 2011, sales are expected to benefit from improved global market conditions. Demand for Kevlar®, Nomex® and Tyvek® products is expected to increase across all regions with continued strength in industrial, consumer and automotive markets. Sales related to the Building Innovations business are expected to increase due to forecasted improvements in construction markets across most regions. Sales related to the Sustainable Solutions business are expected to increase modestly due to the completion of the MECS, Inc. acquisition in 2010. PTOI is expected to improve due to higher sales. PHARMACEUTICALS Segment Sales (Dollars in billions) PTOI (Dollars in millions) 2010 $ - $ 489 2009 $ - $ 1,037 2008 $ - $ 1,025 On October 1, 2001, DuPont Pharmaceuticals was sold to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. DuPont retained its interest in Cozaar® (losartan potassium) and Hyzaar® (losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide). These drugs were developed in collaboration with Merck and are used in the treatment of hypertension. The U.S. patents covering the compounds, pharmaceutical formulation and use for the treatment of hypertension, including approval for pediatric use, expired in 2010. DuPont has exclusively licensed worldwide marketing and manufacturing rights for Cozaar® and Hyzaar® to Merck. Pharmaceuticals receive net proceeds and royalties as outlined below. Merck is responsible for manufacturing, marketing and selling Cozaar® and Hyzaar®. 33 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Pharmaceuticals' Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income is the sum of two parts: income related to a share of the profits from North American sales and certain markets in EMEA, and royalty income derived from worldwide contract net sales linked to the exclusivity term in a particular country. Patents and exclusivity started to expire in prior years and the U.S. exclusivity for Cozaar® ended in April 2010. The worldwide agreement terminates when the following conditions are met: (i) the Canadian exclusivity ends, and (ii) North American sales fall below a certain level. The company experienced its first significant step-down in income from Cozaar®/Hyzaar® in 2010 and expects a continued step-down each subsequent year to zero when the contract ends. In general, management expects a traditional sales, earnings and cash decline for a drug going off patent in the pharmaceutical industry. In the fourth quarter 2009, the company recorded a $63 million charge to other income, net and a reduction to accounts and notes receivable, net in the Pharmaceuticals segment to reflect increased rebates and other sales deductions related to the Cozaar®/Hyzaar® licensing agreement. Outlook Cozaar®/Hyzaar® income is expected to continue to substantially decrease due to the expiration of a majority of the worldwide patents which occurred in 2010. Earnings contributions to the company from the collaboration with Merck are expected to decline in 2011 about $290 million pre-tax from earnings generated in 2010. OTHER The company includes certain embryonic businesses not included in the reportable segments, such as Applied BioSciences and nonaligned businesses in Other. The potential viability of each embryonic business depends on a number of factors including successful product development, market acceptance and production ramp up capabilities. Using these factors and others, management periodically assesses the potential and fit of these businesses and may make investment adjustments based on such assessments. Applied BioSciences is focused on delivering cost advantaged products with superior performance and a smaller environmental footprint that are based on a unique combination of biological, chemical and material science capabilities. Specific global growth projects across the company are consolidated within Applied BioSciences to capitalize on the market opportunities and technology needs in this high-growth industry, including biomaterials and advanced biofuels products and technologies. Applied BioSciences is developing two biofuels businesses: one to commercialize non-food, cellulosic ethanol and the second to commercialize biobutanol. DuPont is pursuing commercialization through two joint ventures: DuPont Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol LLC (DDCE) and Butamax™ Advanced Biofuels LLC, respectively. DDCE now operates a demonstration scale facility in Vonore, Tennessee and Butamax™ now operates a demonstration scale facility in Hull, United Kingdom. Both joint ventures are aggressively pursuing commercialization capabilities. DuPont continues its joint venture with Tate & Lyle PLC, DuPont Tate and Lyle Bio Products LLC, to produce 1,3-propanediol (Bio-PDO™) using a proprietary fermentation and purification process. Bio-PDO™ is the key building block for DuPont™ Sorona® renewably sourced polymer. The joint venture also markets direct sale of Bio-PDO™ under the Zemea® propanediol and Susterra® propanediol brands as a key renewable ingredient in products ranging from industrial to personal care uses. DuPont Tate & Lyle Bio Products LLC is currently expanding capacity to support the production of Bio-PDO™, which is scheduled for completion in 2011. In 2010, the Applied BioSciences business announced the formation, pending European Union approvals, of Actamax™ Surgical Materials LLC, a joint venture with Royal DSM N.V. Actamax™ will bring to market next-generation biomedical materials. Nonaligned businesses include activities and costs associated with Benlate® fungicide and other discontinued businesses. In the aggregate, sales in Other for 2010, 2009 and 2008 represent less than 1 percent of total segment sales. 2010 pre-tax loss of $205 million compared to a loss of $171 million in 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in litigation charges related to discontinued businesses. 34 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2009 pre-tax loss of $171 million compared to a loss of $181 million in 2008. The lower pre-tax loss for the year was mainly due to the net year over year impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities, and lower pre-tax loss for Applied BioSciences. Liquidity & Capital Resources Management believes the company's ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, debt maturities and other cash needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, equity and long-term debt markets and asset sales. The company's current strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings provide excellent access to the capital markets. In addition, cash generating actions have been implemented including spending and working capital reductions and restructuring to better align expenditures and costs. The company will continue to monitor the financial markets in order to respond to changing conditions. Pursuant to its cash discipline policy, the company seeks first to maintain a strong balance sheet and second, to return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2010, provide primary liquidity to support all short-term obligations. The company has access to approximately $2.6 billion in unused credit lines with several major financial institutions, as additional support to meet short-term liquidity needs. The company continually reviews its debt portfolio and occasionally may rebalance it to ensure adequate liquidity and an optimum debt maturity schedule. In 2010, the company issued $0.5 billion of 1.95% Senior Notes due January 15, 2016, $1.0 billion of 3.625% Senior Notes due January 15, 2021 and $0.5 billion of 4.90% Senior Notes due January 15, 2041. The company elected to use the net proceeds to redeem $0.5 billion of its 5.00% Senior Notes due January 15, 2013 and $0.8 billion of its 5.875% Senior Notes due January 15, 2014 and pay down commercial paper issued to fund the $0.5 billion voluntary contribution to its principal U.S. pension plan. The company expects to finance the acquisition of Danisco with about $3.0 billion in existing cash and the remainder in new debt. The completion of the transaction is expected in the second quarter 2011 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals and the tender of more than 90 percent of Danisco shares in the tender offer. In connection with this transaction, the company entered into a $4 billion bridge loan facility and a $2 billion bridge loan facility. The latter requires the company have cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at least equal to $2 billion on hand at all times and readily available for use to purchase Danisco's shares. The bridge loan facilities terminate when the company completes the financing for the acquisition. During 2010, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service revised the company's credit outlook to ""Stable"" from ""Negative"". After the announcement of the potential acquisition of Danisco, Moody's Investors Service placed all of the company's credit ratings under review for possible downgrade. Standard & Poor's has responded to the acquisition announcement by placing the company on credit watch with negative implications. Fitch Ratings announced it will take no immediate action with regard to the company's ratings. 35 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital market and cost of capital. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings are as follows: Long term Short term Outlook Standard & Poor's A A-1 Watch negative Moody's Investors Service A2 P-1 Under review for possible downgrade Fitch Ratings A F1 Negative (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by operating activities $ 4,559 $ 4,741 $ 3,129 The company's cash provided by operating activities was $4.6 billion in 2010, a $0.2 billion decrease compared to 2009. Higher earnings were offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities, mainly due to higher sales and inventory; the stronger dollar, which was hedged with forward exchange contracts reflected in investing activities; and the voluntary contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan. The company's cash provided by operating activities was $4.7 billion in 2009, a $1.6 billion increase from the $3.1 billion generated in 2008. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the weaker dollar, which was hedged by forward exchange contracts in investing activities. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash used for investing activities $ (2,439 ) $ (4,298 ) $ (1,610 ) In 2010, cash used for investing activities totaled $2.4 billion compared to $4.3 billion used in 2009. The $1.9 billion decrease was mainly due to changes in investments in short-term financial instruments and a net increase in proceeds from forward exchange contract settlements, partially offset by an increase in payments for businesses and higher expenditures for the purchases of property, plant and equipment. In 2009, cash used for investing activities totaled $4.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion used in 2008. The $2.7 billion increase was mainly due to the increase in investments in short-term financial instruments and the change in forward exchange contract settlements, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures. Purchases of property, plant and equipment totaled $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $2.0 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Spending in 2010 reflects the company's continued investment in capacity expansion to support areas of growth. The company expects 2011 purchases of plant, property and equipment to be $1.8 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion over 2010, driven by continued growth investments aligned with the company's global trends. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash (used for) provided by financing activities $ (1,829 ) $ (97 ) $ 878 The $1.7 billion increase in cash used for financing activities in 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings in 2010 as compared to an increase in borrowings in 2009. This was partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of cash used to repurchase common stock. 36 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The $1.0 billion decrease in cash provided for financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to changes in net borrowings. Net borrowings increased $1.4 billion in 2009 as compared to $2.1 billion in 2008. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by operating activities $ 4,559 $ 4,741 $ 3,129 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (1,508 ) (1,308 ) (1,978 ) Free cash flow $ 3,051 $ 3,433 $ 1,151 Free cash flow is a measurement not recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, the company's free cash flow definition may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. The company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, and therefore indicates operating cash flow available for payment of dividends, other investing activities, and other financing activities. Free cash flow is useful to investors and management to evaluate the company's cash flow and financial performance, and is an integral financial measure used in the company's financial planning process. 2010 free cash flow of $3.1 billion exceeded the company's target of greater than $1.7 billion primarily due to higher earnings and working capital productivity. Total debt at December 31, 2010 was $10.3 billion, a $0.7 billion decrease from December 31, 2009. The decrease in debt reflects the company's positive cash flow generated from general business activities. Total debt at December 31, 2009 was $11.0 billion, a $1.4 billion increase from December 31, 2008. The proceeds from the increased borrowings were primarily invested in short-term financial instruments. Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.5 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Dividends per share of common stock were $1.64 in 2010, 2009 and 2008. The common dividend declared in the first quarter 2011 was the company's 426th consecutive dividend since the company's first dividend in the fourth quarter 1904. The company's Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share buyback plan in June 2001. During 2010, the company purchased and retired 5.4 million shares at a total cost of $250 million under this plan. During 2009 and 2008, there were no purchases of stock under this plan. As of December 31, 2010, the company has purchased 25.9 million shares at a total cost of $1.2 billion. Management has not established a timeline for the buyback of the remaining shares of stock under this plan. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $6.8 billion at December 31, 2010, $6.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2008. The $0.7 billion increase from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to the company's positive cash flow generated from general business activities. The $2.4 increase from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to cash proceeds from increased borrowings and cash generated from general business activities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee Contracts Indemnifications In connection with acquisitions and divestitures, the company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with acquisitions and divestitures and related business activities prior to the completion of the transaction. The term of these indemnifications, which typically pertain to environmental, tax and product liabilities, is generally indefinite. In addition, the company indemnifies its duly elected or appointed directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, against liabilities incurred as a result of their activities for the 37 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued company, such as adverse judgments relating to litigation matters. If the indemnified party were to incur a liability or have a liability increase as a result of a successful claim, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party. The maximum amount of potential future payments is generally unlimited. The carrying amounts recorded for all indemnifications as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $100 million. Although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed amounts accrued, due to the nature of indemnified items, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist. In connection with the 2004 sale of the majority of the net assets of Textiles and Interiors, the company indemnified the purchasers, subsidiaries of Koch Industries, Inc. (INVISTA), against certain liabilities primarily related to taxes, legal and environmental matters and other representations and warranties under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. The estimated fair value of the indemnity obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement was $70 million and was included in the indemnifications balance of $100 million at December 31, 2010. Under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the company's total indemnification obligation for the majority of the representations and warranties cannot exceed $1.4 billion. The other indemnities are not subject to this limit. In March 2008, INVISTA filed suit in the Southern District of New York alleging that certain representations and warranties in the Purchase and Sale Agreement were breached and, therefore, that DuPont is obligated to indemnify it. DuPont disagrees with the extent and value of INVISTA's claims. DuPont has not changed its estimate of its total indemnification obligation under the Purchase and Sale Agreement as a result of the lawsuit. Obligations for Equity Affiliates and Others The company has directly guaranteed various debt obligations under agreements with third parties related to equity affiliates, customers, suppliers and other affiliated companies. At December 31, 2010, the company had directly guaranteed $544 million of such obligations, and $16 million relating to guarantees of obligations for divested subsidiaries. This represents the maximum potential amount of future (undiscounted) payments that the company could be required to make under the guarantees. The company would be required to perform on these guarantees in the event of default by the guaranteed party. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, a liability of $109 million and $146 million, respectively, was recorded for these obligations, representing the amount of payment/performance risk which the company deems probable. This liability is principally related to obligations of the company's polyester films joint venture which are guaranteed by the company. Existing guarantees for customers and suppliers arose as part of contractual agreements. Existing guarantees for equity affiliates and other affiliated companies arose for liquidity needs in normal operations. In certain cases, the company has recourse to assets held as collateral as well as personal guarantees from customers and suppliers. The company has guaranteed certain obligations and liabilities related to a divested subsidiary, Conoco, which has indemnified the company for any liabilities the company may incur pursuant to these guarantees. No material loss is anticipated by reason of such agreements and guarantees. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the company had no liabilities recorded for these obligations. Additional information with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees. 38 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Contractual Obligations Information related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In (Dollars in millions) Total at December 31, 2010 2011 2012 – 2013 2014 – 2015 2016 and beyond Long-term debt obligations1 $ 10,137 $ 4 $ 1,647 $ 2,106 $ 6,380 Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity 3,858 431 803 623 2,001 Capital leases1 5 1 - 1 3 Operating leases 982 227 357 219 179 Purchase obligations2 Information technology infrastructure & services 246 114 116 16 - Raw material obligations 282 125 106 40 11 Utility obligations 241 99 67 22 53 INVISTA-related obligations3 1,537 124 284 329 800 Human resource services 72 36 36 - - Other4 23 18 5 - - Total purchase obligations 2,401 516 614 407 864 Other liabilities1,5 Workers' compensation 83 14 36 15 18 Asset retirement obligations 59 2 3 19 35 Environmental remediation 407 90 154 83 80 Legal settlements 87 85 2 - - License agreement6 413 90 174 149 - Other7 147 34 24 25 64 Total other long-term liabilities 1,196 315 393 291 197 Total contractual obligations8 $ 18,579 $ 1,494 $ 3,814 $ 3,647 $ 9,624 1Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement. 3Primarily represents raw material supply obligations. 4Primarily represents obligations associated with distribution, health care/benefit administration, research and development and other professional and consulting contracts. 5Pension and other long-term employee benefit obligations have been excluded from the table as they are discussed below within Long-Term Employee Benefits. 6Represents remaining expected payments under a license agreement between Pioneer and Monsanto. 7Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other long-term employee benefits. 8Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the estimate of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations. 39 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Long-Term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability and life insurance protection for employees (other long-term employee benefits). Approximately 80 percent of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide other long-term employee benefit obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits. In 2006, the company announced major changes to the pension and defined contribution benefits that cover the majority of its U.S. employees. Such employees hired in the U.S. after December 31, 2006 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans. Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Unless required by law, the company does not make contributions that are in excess of tax deductible limits. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company made a voluntary contribution of $500 million in 2010 to its principal U.S. pension plan. No contributions are required or currently anticipated to be made to the principal U.S. pension plan in 2011. Contributions beyond 2011 are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. Funding for each pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $782 million to its pension plans in 2010 and anticipates that it will make approximately $305 million in contributions in 2011 to pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan. The company's other long-term employee benefits are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $321 million, $323 million and $326 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This amount is expected to be about $320 million in 2011. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles. 40 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as other long-term employee benefits. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income over each of the last 3 years was affected by pre-tax charges and credits related to long-term employee benefits. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Defined benefit plan charges (benefits) $ 557 $ 155 $ (362 ) Defined contribution plan charges 254 245 250 1 Other long-term employee benefit plan charges 219 220 181 Net amount $ 1,030 $ 620 $ 69 1Includes an accrual of $16 million for company match and contribution based on compensation paid in 2009 for 2008 service. The above (benefits) charges for pension and other long-term employee benefits are determined as of the beginning of each year. The increases in pension expense in 2010 and 2009 primarily related to decreases in the market-related value of the assets in the principal U.S. pension plan. See ""Long-Term Employee Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 22 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan. The company's key assumptions used in calculating its pension and other long-term employee benefits are the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increases and the discount rate (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For 2011, long-term employee benefits expense is expected to increase by about $60 million, primarily due to lower discount rates. Other Employee-Related Benefits In October 2009, the company announced revisions to its vacation benefits policy covering all U.S. employees. Effective December 31, 2010, entitled vacation for the following year will no longer vest at the end of each preceding year. In addition, vacation will be earned monthly and accrued on the first day of each calendar month during the year beginning in 2011. These revisions to the company's vacation benefits policy provided a one-time benefit of $148 million in 2010. Environmental Matters The company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. Related to these activities, the company incurred environmental operating costs of $501 million, $483 million and $525 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 41 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Remediation Expenditures RCRA, which extensively regulates the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, requires that permitted facilities undertake an assessment of environmental contamination. If conditions warrant, companies may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, the costs of the RCRA corrective action program are typically borne solely by the company. The company anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required over the next two decades. Annual expenditures for the near term, however, are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. The company's expenditures associated with RCRA and similar remediation activities were $52 million, $49 million and $51 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. From time to time, the company receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that the company is a PRP under CERCLA or similar state statutes. CERCLA is often referred to as the Superfund and requires companies to undertake certain investigative and research activities at sites where it conducts or once conducted operations or where company generated waste has been disposed. The company has also, on occasion, been engaged in cost recovery litigation initiated by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not company owned, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company's past operations. As of December 31, 2010, the company has been notified of potential liability under CERCLA or state laws at about 405 sites around the U.S., with active remediation under way at approximately 160 of these sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 170 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at 10 new sites during 2010 compared with three and five similar notices in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The company's expenditures associated with CERCLA and similar state remediation activities were approximately $21 million, $18 million and $17 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For nearly all Superfund sites, the company's potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to the company versus that attributable to all other PRPs at any given site is typically relatively low. Other PRPs at sites, where the company is a party, typically have the financial strength to meet their obligations and, where they do not, or where PRPs cannot be located or have declared bankruptcy, the company's own share of liability has not materially increased. There are relatively few sites where the company is a major participant and the cost to the company of remediation at those sites and at all CERCLA sites in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Total payments for previously accrued remediation activities under RCRA, CERCLA and similar state and global laws were $82 million, $72 million and $81 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Remediation Accruals At December 31, 2010, the Consolidated Balance Sheets included an accrued liability of $407 million related to activities under RCRA, CERCLA and similar state and global laws compared to $396 million at December 31, 2009. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, particularly those related to RCRA, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may range up to two to three times the amount accrued as of December 31, 2010. Of the $407 million accrued liability, approximately nine percent was reserved for non-U.S. facilities. Approximately 68 percent of the reserve balance was attributable to RCRA and similar remediation liabilities, while about 23 percent was attributable to CERCLA liabilities. Increases to remediation accruals were $93 million, $89 million and $103 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that a material loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site or location is reasonably possible. 42 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Changes in the remediation accruals balance at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized below: (Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 379 Remediation Payments (72 ) Increase in Accrual 89 Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 396 Remediation Payments (82 ) Increase in Accrual 93 Balance at December 31, 2010 $ 407 Pre-Tax Environmental Expenses Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized below: At December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Environmental Operating Costs $ 501 $ 483 $ 525 Increase in Remediation Accruals 93 89 103 $ 594 $ 572 $ 628 About 75 percent of total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to current operations in 2010 resulted from operations in the U.S. Total pre-tax environmental expenses charged to operations in 2010 increased $22 million versus 2009 due primarily to increased environmental research activities. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year over year changes, if any, in environmental expenses charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Environmental Capital Expenditures In 2010, the company spent approximately $75 million on environmental capital projects either required by law or necessary to meet the company's internal environmental goals. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $100 million in 2011. In the U.S., significant capital expenditures are expected to be required over the next decade for treatment, storage and disposal facilities for solid and hazardous waste and for compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). Until all CAA regulatory requirements are established and known, considerable uncertainty will remain regarding future estimates for capital expenditures. Total CAA capital costs over the next two years are currently estimated to range from $40 million to $70 million. Climate Change The company believes that climate change is an important global issue that will present risks and opportunities to business and society at large. Since the early 1990s when the company began taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the company has achieved major global reductions in emissions. Voluntary emissions reductions implemented by the company and other companies are valuable but alone will not be sufficient to effectively address a problem of this scale. The company is actively engaged in the effort to develop constructive public policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage lower carbon forms of energy. The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in February 2005 and, while not ratified by the U.S., has spurred policy action by many other countries and regions around the world, including the European Union. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of a post-2012 international policy framework to guide international action to address climate change when the Kyoto 43 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Protocol expires in 2012. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect the company's energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from fossil fuels. Such efforts are also anticipated to provide the business community with greater certainty for the regulatory future, help guide investment decisions, and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, technologies, and services. At the national and regional level, there are existing efforts to address climate change. Several of the company's facilities in the European Union are regulated under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. In other countries, including the U.S., policy debate continues. The current unsettled policy environment in the U.S. adds an element of uncertainty to business decisions particularly those relating to long-term capital investments. If in the absence of federal legislation, states were to implement programs mandating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, the company, its suppliers and customers could be competitively disadvantaged by the added administrative costs and burden of complying with a variety of state-specific requirements. A 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling directed EPA to determine whether carbon dioxide endangers human health and, if so, to take steps to regulate it under the CAA. In December 2009, EPA made a determination that carbon dioxide emissions endanger human health and the environment requiring EPA to pursue regulation of carbon dioxide emissions under the CAA. In 2010, EPA launched a phased in scheme to regulate GHG emissions under CAA regulations known as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) rules. The PSD rules require that Best Available Control Technology (BACT) be installed on major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. BACT controls for GHG emissions can require very large capital investments. EPA has not provided final guidance regarding BACT requirements. In addition, EPA in 2010 put in place operating permit requirements for major new or modified sources of GHG emissions. EPA will not require permits for smaller sources until 2016 or later. Both Congressional and litigation efforts are underway to delay or remove EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions and to enforce GHG reporting and permitting regulations. This type of GHG emissions regulation by EPA, in the absence of or in addition to federal legislation, could result in more costly, less efficient facility-by-facility controls versus a federal, market-based cap and trade program. Differences in regional or national legislation could present challenges in a global marketplace highlighting the need for coordinated global policy action. In the fourth quarter 2009, EPA issued the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule which requires reporting of GHG emissions in the United States beginning in 2010. The rule requires suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial greenhouse gases, manufacturers of vehicles and engines, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more per year of GHG emissions to submit annual reports to EPA. The company has approximately 25 sites that have a stake in one or more of the covered gases, including several at which emissions monitoring equipment must be installed. Costs incurred in 2010 to comply with the rule were not material to the company. Based on the current state of rulemaking related to this rule, management does not expect future costs to comply with the rule will be material to the company's operations and consolidated financial position. The company assesses the potential risks that climate change could present, and looks for opportunities to make its overall portfolio less energy and emissions intensive. The company weighs energy use when investments or divestitures are considered. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings in light of the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy. Registration The goal of the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is to prevent unreasonable risks of injury to health or the environment associated with the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of chemical substances. Under TSCA, the EPA has established reporting, record-keeping, testing and control-related requirements for new and existing chemicals. In September 2009, EPA announced its comprehensive approach to enhance the Agency's current chemicals management program under TSCA, including development of action plans. The Agency's actions on chemicals may include initiating regulatory action to label, restrict, or ban a chemical, or to require the 44 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued submission of additional data needed to determine the risk a chemical may pose. Also in 2009, EPA announced its ""Essential Principle for Reform of Chemicals Management Legislation."" The company is monitoring these developments under TSCA. In December 2006, the European Union adopted a new regulatory framework concerning the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals. This regulatory framework known as REACH entered into force on June 1, 2007. One of its main objectives is the protection of human health and the environment. REACH requires manufacturers and importers to gather information on the properties of their substances that meet certain volume or toxicological criteria and register the information in a central database to be maintained by the European Chemicals Agency. The Regulation also contains a mechanism for the progressive substitution of the most dangerous chemicals when suitable alternatives have been identified. Complete registrations containing extensive data on the characteristics of the chemical will be required in three phases, depending on production usage or tonnage imported per year, and the toxicological criteria of the chemical. The first registrations for substances that were preregistered in 2008 were required in 2010; subsequent registrations are due in 2013 and 2018. New substances that will be manufactured or imported need to be registered prior to being placed on the market (also known as non-phase-in substances). The company successfully completed the 2010 registrations and is working on the non-phase-in registrations. By June 1, 2011, companies must notify the European Chemicals Agency of products containing above 0.1 percent of substances of very high concern on the candidate list for authorization. There are now 46 such substances and the notice process may create pressure for substitution away from these substances. By June 1, 2013, the Commission will review whether substances with endocrine disruptive properties should be authorized if safer alternatives exist. Management does not expect that the costs to comply with REACH will be material to its operations and consolidated financial position. Facility Security DuPont recognizes that the security and safety of its operations are critical to its employees, neighbors and, indeed, to the future of the company. As such, the company has merged chemical site security into its safety core value where it serves as an integral part of its long standing safety culture. Physical security measures have been combined with process safety measures (including the use of inherently safer technology), administrative procedures and emergency response preparedness into an integrated security plan. The company has conducted vulnerability assessments at operating facilities in the U.S. and high priority sites worldwide and identified and implemented appropriate measures to protect these facilities from physical and cyber attacks. DuPont is partnering with carriers, including railroad, shipping and trucking companies, to secure chemicals in transit. In April 2007, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an interim final rule (Rule) that establishes risk-based performance standards for the security of U.S. chemical facilities. Covered chemical facilities are required to prepare Security Vulnerability Assessments that identify facility security vulnerabilities and to develop and implement Site Security Plans that include measures satisfying the identified risk-based performance standards. The Rule contains associated provisions addressing inspections and audits, recordkeeping, and the protection of information that constitutes Chemical-terrorism Vulnerability Information. DHS can seek compliance through the issuance of Orders, including Orders Assessing Civil Penalty and Orders for the Cessation of Operations. In June 2008, DHS notified those facilities that were preliminarily determined to be covered by the Rule's security requirements. DuPont facilities that were preliminarily determined to be covered conducted and submitted security vulnerability assessments to DHS. Based on its review of these assessments, DHS made final determinations as to which facilities were covered and the risk-base tier into which each falls. These facilities are submitting site security plans to DHS. Once DHS has reviewed and provided preliminary approval of the plans, it will meet with facilities before providing final approval. DuPont has already devoted substantial effort and resources in assessing security vulnerabilities and taking steps to reinforce security at its chemical manufacturing facilities. Until each facility develops and receives DHS approval for its site security plan, specific requirements cannot be determined and considerable uncertainty exists regarding estimates for future capital expenditures. However, based on guidance issued by DHS regarding its risk-based performance standards, it is expected that new security measures will need to be implemented 45 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued at the regulated facilities and that total capital costs to implement such measures over the next 5 years will be about $50 million. PFOA DuPont manufactures fluoropolymer resins and dispersions as well as fluorotelomers, marketing many of them under the Teflon® and Zonyl® brands. All of these products are part of the Performance Chemicals segment. Fluoropolymer resins and dispersions are high-performance materials with many end uses including architectural fabrics, telecommunications and electronic wiring insulation, automotive fuel systems, computer chip processing equipment, weather-resistant/breathable apparel and non-stick cookware. Fluorotelomers are used to make soil, stain and grease repellants for paper, apparel, upholstery and carpets as well as firefighting foams and coatings. A form of PFOA (collectively, perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt) is used as a processing agent to manufacture fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. For over 50 years, DuPont purchased its PFOA needs from a third party, but beginning in the fall of 2002, it began producing PFOA to support the manufacture of fluoropolymer resins and dispersions. PFOA is not used in the manufacture of fluorotelomers; however, it is an unintended by-product present at trace levels in some fluorotelomer-based products. DuPont Performance Elastomers, LLC (DPE) uses PFOA in the manufacture of raw materials to manufacture Kalrez® perfluoroelastomer parts. PFOA is also used in the manufacture of some fluoroelastomers marketed by DPE under the Viton® trademark. The wholly owned subsidiary is a part of the Performance Materials segment. PFOA is bio-persistent and has been detected at very low levels in the blood of the general population. As a result, EPA initiated a process to enhance its understanding of the sources of PFOA in the environment and the pathways through which human exposure to PFOA is occurring. In 2005, EPA issued a draft risk assessment on PFOA stating that the cancer data for PFOA may be best described as ""suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential"" under EPA's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. At EPA's request, the Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed and commented on the scientific soundness of this assessment. In its May 2006 report, the SAB set forth the view, based on laboratory studies in rats, that the human carcinogenic potential of PFOA is more consistent with the Guidelines' descriptor of ""likely to be carcinogenic."" However, the report stated that additional data should be considered before EPA finalizes its risk assessment of PFOA. EPA has acknowledged that it will consider additional data, including new research and testing, and has indicated that another SAB review will be sought after EPA makes its risk assessment. DuPont disputes the cancer classification recommended in the SAB report. Although EPA has stated that there remains considerable scientific uncertainty regarding potential risks associated with PFOA, it also stated that it does not believe that there is any reason for consumers to stop using any products because of concerns about PFOA. DuPont respects EPA's position raising questions about exposure routes and the potential toxicity of PFOA and DuPont and other companies have outlined plans to continue research, emission reduction and product stewardship activities to help address EPA's questions. In January 2006, DuPont pledged its commitment to EPA's 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program. The EPA program asks participants (1) to commit to achieve, no later than 2010, a 95 percent reduction in both facility emissions and product content levels of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals and (2) to commit to working toward the elimination of PFOA, PFOA precursors and related higher homologue chemicals from emissions and products by no later than 2015. In October 2010, (for the year 2009), DuPont reported to EPA that it had achieved about a 99 percent reduction of PFOA emissions in U.S. manufacturing facilities. The company achieved about a 98 percent reduction in global manufacturing emissions, exceeding EPA's 2010 objective. In February 2007, DuPont announced its commitment to no longer make, use or buy PFOA by 2015, or sooner if possible. To achieve this goal, DuPont developed PFOA replacement technology and is converting customers to fluoropolymer resins and dispersions manufactured using the replacement technology. In addition since 2008, DuPont has been introducing its next generation fluorotelomers products and converting customers to their use. In the fourth quarter 2009, EPA announced the start of a comprehensive approach to enhancing EPA's current chemicals management program under TSCA. As part of this enhancement, EPA released four Existing Chemical 46 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Action Plans (the Plans) in December 2009 of which one covers long-chain perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) including PFOA. The Plans outline the risks that the use of the specified chemicals may present and the specific steps that EPA will take to address concerns. EPA indicated that it intends to propose regulatory actions in 2012 to address the potential risks from PFCs, but the specific steps noted in the PFCs Plan are generally consistent with the requirements of the 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. In January 2009, EPA issued a national Provisional Health Advisory for PFOA of 0.4 parts per billion (ppb) in drinking water. In February 2007, NJDEP identified a preliminary drinking-water guidance level for PFOA of 0.04 ppb as part of the first phase of an ongoing process to establish a state drinking-water standard. During the first quarter 2009, NJDEP began the process to establish a permanent Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for PFOA in drinking water. The process is estimated to take 1 to 2 years. While NJDEP will continue sampling and evaluation of data from all sources, it has not recommended a change in consumption patterns. Based on extensive health and toxicological studies, DuPont believes that PFOA exposure does not pose a health risk to the general public. Human studies have evaluated many health endpoints across a wide range of exposed populations. While some associations have been reported, no human health effects are known to be caused by PFOA. A considerable number of human health studies are ongoing and results will be available over the next several years. There have not been any regulatory or government actions that prohibit the production or use of PFOA. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be in the future. Products currently manufactured by the company representing approximately $1 billion of 2010 revenues could be affected by any such regulation or prohibition. DuPont has established reserves in connection with certain PFOA environmental and litigation matters (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Financial Instruments Derivatives and Other Hedging Instruments In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to hedge its exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. Derivative instruments utilized include forwards, options, futures and swaps. The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions and major commodity exchanges. The company hedges certain foreign currency-denominated revenues, monetary assets and liabilities, certain business-specific foreign currency exposures and certain energy and agricultural feedstock purchases. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments, accounts receivable and derivatives. As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service DuPont and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or small group of customers. As of December 31, 2010, no one individual customer balance represented more than 5 percent of the company's total outstanding receivables balance. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global businesses. 47 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, continued The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by industry and region. Foreign Currency Risk The company's objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency rate changes. Accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar value of its existing foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, commitments, and cash flows. The company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The primary business objective of this hedging program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes, net of related tax effects, are minimized. The company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company's exposure to certain foreign currency-denominated revenues so that gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar value of the related foreign currency-denominated revenues. The objective of the hedge program is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The following table summarizes the impacts of this program on the company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, and includes the company's pro rata share of its equity affiliates' exchange gains and losses and corresponding gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Pre-tax exchange loss $ (13 ) $ (205 ) $ (255 ) Tax (expense) benefit (71 ) 91 83 After-tax loss $ (84 ) $ (114 ) $ (172 ) From time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the USD amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts are also used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements. Interest Rate Risk The company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of the total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed or floating rate interest payments to effectively convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt based on USD LIBOR. Interest rate swaps allow the company to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. Commodity Price Risk The company enters into over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on certain raw material purchases. A portion of certain energy feedstock purchases are hedged to reduce price volatility using fixed price swaps and options. The company contracts with independent growers to produce finished seed inventory. Under these contracts, growers are compensated with bushel equivalents that are marketed to the company for the market price of grain during the 48 Table of Contents Part II ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, continued contract period. Derivative instruments having a high correlation to the underlying commodity are used to hedge the commodity price risk involved in compensating growers. The company utilizes derivatives to manage the price volatility of soybean meal. These derivative instruments have a high correlation to the underlying commodity exposure and are deemed effective in offsetting soybean meal feedstock price risk. Additional details on these and other financial instruments are set forth in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Sensitivity Analysis The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the market prices or rates that existed at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The sensitivity for interest rate swaps is based on a one percent change in the market interest rate. Foreign currency and energy derivative sensitivities are based on a 10 percent change in market rates.

Where, in any forward-looking statement or other estimate, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of Corteva’s management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. Corteva disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable law. A detailed discussion of some of the significant risks and uncertainties which may cause results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).31Part IIITEM 7.

Predecessor / Successor ReportingFor purposes of DowDuPont's financial statement presentation, Historical Dow was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger and Historical DuPont's assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value as of the close of the Merger in the financial statements of DowDuPont. In connection with the Merger and the related accounting determination, Historical DuPont elected to apply push-down accounting and reflect in its financial statements, the fair value of its assets and liabilities. For purposes of Corteva’s financial statement presentation, periods following the close of the Merger are labeled “Successor” and reflect DowDuPont’s basis in the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Corteva/EID. All periods prior to the closing of the Merger reflect the historical accounting basis in EID 's assets and liabilities and are labeled “Predecessor.” The Consolidated Financial Statements and Footnotes include a black line division between the columns titled ""Predecessor"" and ""Successor"" to signify that the amounts shown for the periods prior to and following the Merger are not comparable. In addition, the company elected to make certain changes in presentation to harmonize its accounting and reporting with that of DowDuPont in the Successor periods. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these changes.32Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results In addition to the Analysis of Operations discussion based on the GAAP as reported results, the following includes a supplemental Analysis of Operations discussion reflecting unaudited pro forma financial information, prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. This unaudited pro forma financial information, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 assumes the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended December 31, 2017 gives effect to the above noted transactions in addition to the common control business combination with DAS, as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For additional information, see the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information in this section.33Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Overview The following is a summary of results from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019:•The company reported net sales of $13,846 million, down 3 percent versus the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting a 3 percent decline in currency.•Cost of goods sold (""COGS"") totaled $8,575 million, down from $9,948 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by lower volumes as a result of weather-related planting delays in North America as well as lower amortization of inventory step-up. All inventory step-up has been amortized.•Restructuring and asset related charges - net were $222 million, a decrease from $694 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.•Integration and separation costs were $744 million, down from $992 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting post-Merger integration and Business Separation activities.•Loss from continuing operations after income taxes was $(270) million, as compared to a loss of $(6,775) million for the year ended December 31, 2018.•The company realized cost synergies of approximately $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, on track to deliver $1.2 billion through 2021.•Pro forma operating EBITDA was $1,987 million, down from $2,072 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to page 58 for further discussion of the company's Non-GAAP financial measures.In addition to the financial highlights above, the following events occurred during or subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2019:•The company launched a new pure play agriculture company with the new Corteva brand, new values, and a new purpose.•The company returned approximately $220 million to shareholders since the Separation through its previously announced share repurchase program and common stock dividends.•During the fourth quarter of 2019, the company decided to accelerate the ramp-up of its Enlist E3™ soybeans, as well as its Enlist One® and Enlist Duo® herbicides, in the U.S. and Canada. Refer to Prepaid Royalties within the Critical Accounting Estimates section on page 70 for additional information.•The company agreed to sell Chlorpyrifos assets in India; Bensulfuron-Methyl assets in Asia Pacific (excluding China); Quinoxyfen business assets; and a selection of U.S. herbicide brands during the fourth quarter. These actions are aligned with the company’s commitment to driving an active portfolio management approach focused on margin expansion and shareholder value creation.Priorities Corteva is committed to making an impact for its customers, while focusing on five priorities for shareholder value creation: (1) instilling a strong culture, (2) driving disciplined capital allocation, (3) developing innovative solutions, (4) attaining best-in-class cost structure and (5) delivering above market growth. The company believes the following key pillars will enable it to create significant value for its customers while delivering strong financial returns to its shareholders: •Developing and launching new offerings that address market needs by continuing to leverage its robust pipeline to introduce new proprietary seed traits and crop protection formulations that anticipate and meet evolving customer needs. •Utilizing its multi-channel and multi-brand capabilities to drive profitable growth by strategically aligning its brands and capabilities across different sales channels and creating a comprehensive multi-channel, multi-brand strategy. 34Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued •Continuing to develop and maintain close connections with customers by working closely with farmers throughout the entire growing season to ensure all their seed and crop protection needs are anticipated and satisfied. •Focusing on operational excellence by integrating its operations and continuing to drive operating efficiencies, enabling a streamlined, efficient and focused organization while working to achieve a best-in-class cost structure and creating a strong culture based on productivity. •Furthering its commitment to sustainable and responsible agriculture by focusing on integrating sustainability criteria early in the product discovery and development phases as well as promoting the development of responsible solutions focused on reducing the environmental impact of agriculture over time. 35Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of Operations Debt Redemptions/RepaymentsOn March 22, 2019, EID issued notices of redemption in full of all of its outstanding notes (the “Make Whole Notes”) listed in the table below:(in millions)Amount4.625% Notes due 2020$4743.625% Notes due 20212964.250% Notes due 20211632.800% Notes due 20233816.500% Debentures due 2028575.600% Senior Notes due 2036424.900% Notes due 2041484.150% Notes due 204369Total$1,530The Make Whole Notes were redeemed on April 22, 2019 at the make-whole redemption prices set forth in the respective Make Whole Notes. On and after the date of redemption, the Make Whole Notes were no longer deemed outstanding, interest on the Make Whole Notes ceased to accrue and all rights of the holders of the Make Whole Notes were terminated.In March 2016, EID entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (as amended, from time to time, the ""Term Loan Facility"") under which EID could make up to seven term loan borrowings and amounts repaid or prepaid were not available for subsequent borrowings. On May 2, 2019, EID terminated its Term Loan Facility and repaid the aggregate outstanding principal amount of $3 billion plus accrued and unpaid interest through and including May 1, 2019.In connection with the repayment of the Make Whole Notes and the Term Loan Facility, Corteva paid a total of $4.6 billion in the second quarter 2019, which included breakage fees and accrued and unpaid interest on the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility. The repayment of the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility was funded with cash from operations and a contribution from DowDuPont.On May 7, 2019, DowDuPont publicly announced the record date in connection with the Corteva Distribution. In connection with such announcement, EID was required to redeem $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.200% Notes due 2020 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (collectively, the Special Mandatory Redemption, or “SMR Notes”) setting forth the date of redemption of the SMR Notes. On May 17, 2019 EID redeemed and paid a total of $2.0 billion, which included accrued and unpaid interest on the SMR Notes. EID funded the payment with a contribution from DowDuPont. Following the redemption, the SMR Notes are no longer outstanding and no longer bear interest, and all rights of the holders of the SMR Notes have terminated.EID recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $13 million related to the difference between the redemption price and the par value of the Make Whole Notes, the Term Loan Facility, and the SMR Notes, partially offset by the write-off of unamortized step-up related to the fair value step-up of EID’s debt.36Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Impact From Previously Enacted TariffsIn 2018, certain countries where the company’s products are manufactured, distributed or sold previously enacted tariffs on certain products. The tariffs contributed to an expected shift to soybeans from corn in Latin America and pressured North American farmer margins. These expectations were reflected in the revised long-term cash flow projections for the company's agriculture reporting unit in 2018, as discussed in Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January, 2020 the United States and China signed ""phase one"" of a trade agreement (""China Trade Agreement"") and the United States (""U.S."") and Mexico ratified the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (""USMCA""). The China Trade Agreement commits China to purchase at least $40 billion worth of U.S. farm goods annually and for China to reduce non-tariff barriers to agriculture products such as poultry and feed additives, as well as approval of biotechnology products. Additionally, the China Trade Agreement includes stronger intellectual property protections and the elimination of any pressure for foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms as a condition of market access. While the USMCA will replace the North America Free Trade Agreement, it is not a one-for-one replacement. It is designed to modernize trade rules in North America, ensure open markets, protect innovations for a majority of U.S. goods, and enhance sanitary/phytosanitary standards. The company expects the impacts of these agreements to overall be positive for demand for U.S. agriculture products.Tax ReformOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“The Act”) was enacted. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax (“transition tax”) on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, creates new provisions related to foreign sourced earnings, eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a territorial system. As of December 31, 2018, the company had completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act. As a result of The Act, the company remeasured its U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent. The company recorded a cumulative benefit of $2,847 million ($2,813 million benefit in the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $34 million benefit during 2018) to provision for (benefit from) income taxes on continuing operations in the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations with respect to the remeasurement of the company's deferred tax balances. Additionally, the company recorded a cumulative charge of $928 million ($746 million charge in the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $182 million charge during 2018) to provision for (benefit from) income taxes on continuing operations with respect to the one-time transition tax. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, The Act introduced new provisions for U.S. taxation of certain global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). The Company has made the policy election to record any liability associated with GILTI in the period in which it is incurred. Additional details related to The Act can be found in Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.DowDuPont Agriculture Division Restructuring Program During the fourth quarter of 2018 and in connection with the ongoing integration activities, DowDuPont approved restructuring actions to simplify and optimize certain organizational structures in preparation for the Business Separations. The company recorded a pre-tax charge of $84 million, recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations comprised of $78 million of severance and related benefit costs and $6 million related to asset related charges. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company recorded a net pre-tax benefit of $14 million, recognized in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations comprised of $17 million of severance and related benefit credits and $3 million related to asset related charges. The company's actions related to this program are complete.DowDuPont Cost Synergy ProgramIn September and November 2017, DowDuPont and EID approved post-merger restructuring actions under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the “Synergy Program”), adopted at the time by the DowDuPont Board of Directors. The Synergy Program was designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the Business Separations. The company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $845 million inception-to-date under the Synergy Program, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $319 million, contract termination costs of $193 million, and asset-related charges of $333 million. Actions associated with the Synergy Program, including employee separations, are substantially complete.Future cash payments related to this program are anticipated to be approximately $69 million, related to the payment of severance and related benefits and contract termination costs. The company anticipates including cumulative savings associated with these actions within its cost synergy commitment of $1.2 billion through 2021. Additional details related to this plan can be found in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on page 44 of this report and Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.37Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued FMC TransactionsOn March 31, 2017, EID and FMC Corporation (""FMC"") entered into a definitive agreement (the ""FMC Transaction Agreement""). Under the FMC Transaction Agreement, and effective upon the closing of the transaction on November 1, 2017, FMC acquired the crop protection business and R&D assets that EID was required to divest in order to obtain European Commission approval of the Merger Transaction, (the ""Divested Ag Business"") and EID agreed to acquire certain assets relating to FMC’s Health and Nutrition segment, excluding its Omega-3 products (the ""H&N Business"") (collectively, the ""FMC Transactions""). The sale of the Divested Ag Business meets the criteria for discontinued operations and as such, earnings are included within (loss) income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.On November 1, 2017, EID completed the FMC Transactions through the disposition of the Divested Ag Business and the acquisition of the H&N Business. The fair value, as determined by the company, of the H&N Business was $1,970 million. The FMC Transactions included a cash consideration payment to EID of approximately $1,200 million, which reflects the difference in value between the Divested Ag Business and the H&N Business, as well as favorable contracts with FMC of $495 million. The carrying value of the Divested Ag Business approximated the fair value of the consideration received, thus no resulting gain or loss was recognized on the sale. The H&N Business was transferred to DowDuPont as part of the EID Specialty Products Entities. Refer to Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Separation of Performance Chemicals On July 1, 2015, EID completed the separation of its Performance Chemicals segment through the spin-off of all of the issued and outstanding stock of The Chemours Company (""Chemours""). In connection with the separation, EID and Chemours entered into a Separation Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement as well as certain ancillary agreements. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""), the results of operations of its former Performance Chemicals segment are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are included within (loss) income from discontinued operations after income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. Additional details regarding the separation and other related agreements can be found in Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Settlement of PFOA MDLAs previously reported, approximately 3,550 lawsuits were consolidated in multi-district litigation (“MDL”); these lawsuits alleged personal injury from exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and its salts, including the ammonium salt (""PFOA""), in drinking water as a result of the historical manufacture or use of PFOA. The plant operating units involved in the allegations are owned and operated by Chemours. The MDL was settled in early 2017 for $670.7 million in cash, with Chemours and EID (without indemnification from Chemours) each paying half.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2019 versus 2018Net sales were $13,846 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $14,287 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a 3 percent decline in currency. Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily driven by the Brazilian Real and the Euro. Volume was flat as strong demand for new product and gains in corn in EMEA were offset by significant weather-related planting delays in North America, resulting in lost spring applications of crop protection products and a reduction in planted area for soybeans. Pricing gains from new product launches and favorable mix in Latin America were offset by competitive pricing pressure, increases in replant, and increased grower incentive program discounts in North America. 2018 versus 2017 Net sales were $14,287 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3,790 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $6,894 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of DAS for the full year in 2018 versus only four months in 2017 ($3,432 million increase). Pro forma net sales were $14,287 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to pro forma net sales of $14,241 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a 2 percent increase in local price, partially offset by a 2 percent decline in currency. The increase in local price was driven by a favorable mix in North America as well as increases in crop protection pricing in Latin America to offset currency pressure. Volume was flat as gains in crop protection due to new product launches, including VESSARYATM in Latin America, ENLISTTM products in North America and Latin America, and PYRAXALTTM in Asia Pacific, were offset by lower planted area in North America and Latin America and lower demand for nitrogen stabilizers in North America.

The decrease was primarily driven by lower amortization of remaining inventory step up compared to the prior year ($272 million in 2019 compared to $1,554 million in 2018). The remaining COGS decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes as a result of weather-related planting delays in North America, cost synergies and a currency benefit, partially offset by higher input costs for both seed and crop protection. COGS as a percentage of net sales was 62 percent and 70 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amortization of inventory step-up was 2 percent and 11 percent of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On a pro forma basis, COGS was $8,386 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $8,449 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes as a result of weather-related planting delays in North America, cost synergies and a currency benefit, partially offset by higher input costs for both seed and crop protection. Pro forma COGS as a percentage of pro forma net sales was 61 percent and 59 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was due to higher input costs for both seed and crop protection, partially offset by cost synergies.40Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2018 versus 2017COGS was $9,948 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2,915 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $3,409 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of DAS for the full year in 2018 versus only four months in 2017 ($2,383 million increase), the amortization of the inventory step-up of $1,554 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 (compared to $425 million period September 1 through December 31, 2017), increased expenses due to the elimination of the other operating charges financial statement line item subsequent to the Merger, and higher depreciation related to the fair value step up of property, plant and equipment. COGS as a percentage of net sales was 70 percent, 77 percent, and 49 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. The amortization of the inventory step-up was 11 percent of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, respectively. The elimination of the other operating charges financial statement line item would have increased COGS as a percentage of net sales by 3 percent for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. The remaining COGS change as a percentage of net sales between the Predecessor and Successor periods of 2017 and 2018 was primarily due to higher raw material costs, partially offset by synergies. Pro forma COGS for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $8,449 million compared to $8,338 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The increase was primarily driven by amortization of germplasm assets, which changed from an indefinite lived intangible asset to definite lived with a useful life of 25 years in fourth quarter of 2019. Beginning in 2020, the company expects annual amortization expense to increase by approximately $250 million. The remaining increase in amortization expense is primarily due to the reclassification of amounts from indefinite-lived in-process research and development (""IPR&D"") to developed technology as a result of the company's launch of its Qrome® corn hybrids following the receipt of regulatory approval from China. See Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information for above items. 2018 versus 2017Intangible asset amortization was $391 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $97 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017.

The change was primarily driven by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,102 million and adjustments of certain unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken on items from prior years from previously divested businesses. 2018 versus 2017(Loss) income from discontinued operations after tax was $1,748 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, $(568) million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and $1,403 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. The amounts are primarily driven by the divestitures of EID ECP, the EID Specialty Products Entities, the Divested Ag Business, and Performance Chemicals. Refer to Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.EID Analysis of OperationsAs discussed in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements, EID is a subsidiary of Corteva, Inc. and continues to be a reporting company, subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The below relates to EID only and is presented to provide an Analysis of Operations, only for the differences between EID and Corteva, Inc.Interest Expense2019 versus 2018 EID’s interest expense was $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $337 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by the items noted on page 47, under the header “Interest Expense - 2019 versus 2018”, partially offset by interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 49Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Provision for Income Taxes2019For the year ended December 31, 2019, EID had an effective tax rate of 16.8 percent on pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $(422) million, driven by the items noted on page 48, under the header “Provision for Income Taxes - 2019” and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Corporate Outlook Global demand for agriculture products continues to be strong, but growth is slow. Slower growth in China and other key emerging markets is impacting the outlook for demand for commodity grains and oilseeds. Additionally, the recent U.S. - China Phase 1 trade agreement and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement are expected to have a positive impact on demand for U.S. agriculture products. It is expected that corn and soybean area and production will be higher in 2020 and the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) estimates that farm prices will increase modestly. The company expects a 4 - 5 percent increase in net sales, driven by a return to more normalized conditions in North America and continued penetration of new product sales. Additionally, the company expects year over year currency impacts to be minimal. The company expects Operating EBITDA to increase approximately 12 percent and Operating Earnings Per Share to increase approximately 5 percent, driven by the above increase in sales, synergies and productivity actions. Refer to further discussion of Non-GAAP metrics on pages 58 - 60.Corteva is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty items outside of the company’s control, such as Significant Items, without unreasonable effort (refer to page 59 for Significant Items recorded in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017). However, the company expects non-operating benefits - net, to be slightly higher, as a result of an increase in long-term employee benefit credits, and expects an increase in amortization expense in 2020. Refer to Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to the company's discussion on Long-term Employee Benefits on page 72. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2020, the company expects to recognize non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a restructuring and asset related charge. For further discussion of accelerated prepaid royalty amortization refer to the Company's Critical Accounting Estimates for Prepaid Royalties on page 70.50Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial InformationThe supplemental unaudited pro forma statements of operations (the ""unaudited pro forma statements of operations"") for Corteva for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 give effect to the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 gives effect to the above noted transactions in addition to the common control business combination with DAS, as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2016, which the Company believes provides meaningful information to investors as a useful comparison of year over year results.For the periods presented below, Corteva’s results for all periods prior to the Business Realignment and Internal Reorganization consist of the combined results of operations for Historical EID and DAS, and Corteva’s results for all periods after the Business Realignment and Internal Reorganization represent the consolidated balances of the company. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations below were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, and events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., amortization of inventory step-up costs) are excluded. One-time transaction-related costs incurred prior to, or concurrent with, the closing of the Merger, the debt redemptions/repayments, and the Corteva Distribution are not included in the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations through March 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations do not reflect restructuring or integration activities or other costs following the separation and distribution transactions that may be incurred to achieve cost or growth synergies of Corteva. As no assurance can be made that these costs will be incurred or the growth synergies will be achieved, no adjustment has been made.The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what Corteva’s results of operations actually would have been had the above transactions been completed on January 1, 2016. In addition, the unaudited pro forma statements of operations do not purport to project the future operating results of the company. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations were based on and should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 51Part IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 3 - Recent Accounting Guidance, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. Segment Reviews The company operates in two reportable segments: seed and crop protection. The company’s seed segment is a global leader in developing and supplying advanced germplasm and traits that produce optimum yield for farms around the world. The segment offers trait technologies that improve resistance to weather, disease, insects and weeds, and trait technologies that enhance food and nutritional characteristics, and also provides digital solutions that assist farmer decision-making with a view to optimize product selection and, ultimately, maximize yield and profitability. The segment competes in a wide variety of agricultural markets. The crop protection segment serves the global agricultural input industry with products that protect against weeds, insects and other pests, and disease, and that improve overall crop health both above and below ground via nitrogen management and seed-applied technologies. The segment is a leader in global herbicides, insecticides, below-ground nitrogen stabilizers and pasture and range management herbicides.Summarized below are comments on individual segment net sales and segment operating EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. For all periods presented, segment operating EBITDA is calculated on a pro forma basis, as this is the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") assesses performance and allocates resources. Additionally, segment sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 are calculated on a pro forma basis. Pro forma adjustments used in the calculation of pro forma segment operating EBITDA were determined in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, these adjustments give effect to the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, in addition to the above, the adjustments give effect to the common control business combination with DAS, as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2016 (refer to supplemental unaudited pro forma financial statements on page 51). The company defines segment operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., income from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, corporate expenses, non-operating costs-net and foreign exchange gains (losses), excluding the impact of significant items (including goodwill impairment charges). Non-operating costs-net consists of non-operating pension and OPEB costs, tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy EID businesses and sites. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. See Note 25 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (charges) excluded from segment operating EBITDA. All references to prices are based on local price unless otherwise specified.A reconciliation of pro forma segment operating EBITDA to income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is included in Note 25 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously noted, the Predecessor period reflects the results of operations and assets and liabilities of Historical DuPont and excludes the DAS business. As a result, the company's segment results for the Predecessor and Successor periods of 2017 do not reflect the manner in which the company's CODM assesses performance and allocates resources, therefore the company determined that presenting segment results for each standalone period in 2017 would not be meaningful to the reader. Therefore, segment metrics are not presented for the Successor and Predecessor periods of 2017, and instead are presented for the full year of 2017 on a pro forma basis. Refer to page 60 for reconciliation of pro forma income from continuing operations after income taxes to pro forma segment operating EBITDA, for the year ended December 31, 2017.55Part IIITEM 7.

The decrease was primarily due to a 2 percent decline in currency and a 1 percent decline in volume. Local price was flat.Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to the Brazilian Real, Eastern European currencies, and the Euro. Volume gains in corn in EMEA were more than offset by significant weather-related planting delays in North America, leading to a reduction in planted area for soybeans, and multi-channel and multi-brand rationalization impacts in North America. Competitive pricing pressure in soybeans in the U.S. and increased soybean and corn replant in North America were offset by favorable mix and continued penetration of PowerCore Ultra® in Latin America. Seed pro forma operating EBITDA was $1,040 million in 2019, down 9 percent from $1,139 million in 2018. Competitive pricing pressure, the unfavorable impact of currency, increased commissions and input costs, and volume declines more than offset cost synergies and ongoing productivity.Seed net sales were $7,842 million in 2018, $1,520 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $5,865 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. Pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $8,056 million. The decrease in pro forma net sales was primarily due to a 3 percent decline in volume and a 1 percent decline in currency, partially offset by a 1 percent increase in local price. Volume declines represented lower planted area in North America and Latin America. Increases in local price and product mix were driven by continued penetration of new corn hybrids and A-Series soybeans. Seed pro forma operating EBITDA was $1,139 million in 2018, down 3 percent from $1,170 million in 2017. Cost synergies were more than offset by lower volume, higher raw material costs and royalty expense, and investments to support new product launches and digital platforms.56Part IIITEM 7.

The decrease was primarily due to a 3 percent decline in currency and a 1 percent decline in portfolio, partially offset by a 1 percent increase in volume. Local price was flat.Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to Brazilian Real and the Euro. Volume gains driven by new product launches - including EnlistTM and ArylexTM herbicides and IsoclastTM insecticide - were partially offset by the unfavorable weather in North America, which resulted in lost spring applications. Pricing gains from new products launches were offset by increased grower incentive program discounts in North America. The portfolio impact was driven by divestitures in North America and Asia Pacific.Crop Protection pro forma operating EBITDA was $1,066 million in 2019, down 1 percent from $1,074 million in 2018. Volume declines in North America, the unfavorable impact of currency, and higher input costs more than offset cost synergies, sales from new products, and ongoing productivity. Crop protection net sales were $6,445 million in 2018, $2,270 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 and $1,029 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017. Pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $6,185 million. The increase in pro forma net sales was primarily due to a 3 percent increase in volume and a 3 percent increase in local price, partially offset by a 2 percent decline in currency. Volume gains were driven by new product launches such as VessaryaTM fungicides, EnlistTM products, and IsoclastTM, Pyraxalt™ and Spinosyn™ insecticides and were partly offset by lower demand for nitrogen stabilizers in North America and currency pressures in Latin America. Increases in local prices were driven by continuing efforts to capture value in established brands across the crop protection portfolio globally. Crop Protection pro forma operating EBITDA was $1,074 million in 2018, up 15 percent from $936 million in 2017. Cost synergies and sales gains from new product launches were partially offset by growth investments, including for new product launches, higher raw material costs and the unfavorable impact of currency.57Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe company presents certain financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include pro forma operating EBITDA and pro forma operating earnings per share. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and a more useful comparison of year over year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the company's U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP are provided below. For all periods presented, these non-GAAP measures are being reconciled to a pro forma GAAP financial measure prepared and presented in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, which are reconciled to the GAAP reported figures. See Article 11 Pro Forma Combined Statements of Operations on page 51.Pro Forma Operating EBITDA is defined as earnings (i.e., income from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating benefits, net and foreign exchange gains (losses), excluding the impact of significant items (including goodwill impairment charges). Non-operating benefits, net consists of non-operating pension and OPEB credits, tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy businesses and sites of Historical DuPont. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. Pro forma operating earnings per share is defined as ""Earnings per common share from continuing operations - diluted"" excluding the after-tax impact of significant items (including goodwill impairment charges), the after-tax impact of non-operating benefits, net, and the after-tax impact of amortization expense associated with intangible assets existing as of the Separation from DowDuPont. Although amortization of the Company's intangible assets is excluded from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in amortization of additional intangible assets.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued As discussed in Note 25 - Segment Information, the Predecessor period reflects the results of operations and assets and liabilities of Historical DuPont and excludes the DAS business. As a result, the company's segment results for the Predecessor and Successor periods of 2017 do not reflect the manner in which the company's chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources, therefore the company determined that presenting segment results for each standalone period in 2017 would not be meaningful to the reader. Below is a reconciliation of pro forma income from continuing operations after income taxes to pro forma segment operating EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The tax benefit impact of significant items for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a net tax charge of $35 million related to application of the U.S. Tax Reform’s foreign tax provisions, a net tax charge of $146 million related to U.S. state blended tax rate changes associated with the Business Separations, and a net tax benefit of $(102) million related to an internal legal entity restructuring associated with the Business Separations. Unless specifically addressed above, the income tax effect on significant items was calculated based upon the enacted tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.2. The tax only significant item (benefits) charges are primarily related to effects of U.S. and Swiss Tax Reform, the Internal Reorganizations and Business Separations, and the release of a tax valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset position of a Swiss legal entity.59Part IIITEM 7.

Total debt at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was $122 million and $7,938 million, respectively. The decrease in cash and debt balances was primarily due to debt redemption/repayment transactions. See further information under Note 17 - Short-term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned to EID are as follows: Long-termShort-termOutlookStandard & Poor's1A-A-2StableMoody’s Investors ServiceA3P-2StableFitch RatingsAF1Stable1.In addition, Standard & Poor’s has assigned to Corteva, Inc. a long-term issuer rating of A- with Stable outlook.60Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund its operations, including seasonal working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases and pension contributions. Corteva's strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings will provide access as needed to capital markets and commercial paper markets to fund seasonal working capital needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing and committed receivable repurchase facilities. The company has access to approximately $6.4 billion in committed and uncommitted unused credit lines at December 31, 2019. These unused credit lines provide support to meet the company’s short-term liquidity needs and for general corporate purposes which may include funding of pension contributions, severance payments, working capital, capital expenditures, and funding Corteva's expenses.In November 2018, EID entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 Revolving Credit Facilities”). The 2018 Revolving Credit Facilities became effective May 2019 in connection with the termination of the EID $4.5 billion Term Loan Facility and the $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility dated May 2014. Corteva, Inc. became a party to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facilities upon the Corteva Distribution. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facilities contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. The 2018 Revolving Credit Facilities also contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At December 31, 2019, the company was in compliance with these covenants.The company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations affecting manufacturing plants, mineral producing properties or research facilities located in the U.S. and the consolidated subsidiaries owning such plants, properties and facilities subject to certain limitations. The outstanding long-term debt also contains customary default provisions.The company has meaningful seasonal working capital needs based in part on providing financing to its customers. Working capital is funded through multiple methods including commercial paper, a receivable repurchase facility, factoring and cash from operations.In February 2019, in line with seasonal working capital requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase agreement of up to $1.3 billion (the ""2019 Repurchase Facility"") which expired in December 2019. Under the 2019 Repurchase Facility, the company sold a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables to participating institutions and simultaneously agreed to repurchase at a future date. In February 2020, the company entered into a new committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $1.3 billion (the ""2020 Repurchase Facility"") which expires in December 2020. See further discussion of the 2020 Repurchase Facility in Note 27 - Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The company has factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions primarily in Latin America to sell its trade receivables under both recourse and non-recourse agreements in exchange for cash proceeds in an effort to reduce its receivables risk. For arrangements that include an element of recourse, the company provides a guarantee of the trade receivables in the event of customer default. Refer to Note 12 - Accounts and Notes Receivable - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.The company also organizes agreements with third-party financial institutions who directly provide financing for select customers of its seed and crop protection products in each region. Terms of the third-party loans are less than a year and programs are renewed on an annual basis. In some cases, the company guarantees a portion of the extension of such credit to such customers. Refer to Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the company’s guarantees.Capacity ExpansionThe company's Board of Directors authorized an investment of approximately $145 million to increase Spinosyns fermentation capacity by 30% to address global market growth in insecticides that handle chewing insects in specialty and row crops. The additional capacity will be staged to come online over the next few years.61Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Debt Redemptions/RepaymentsIn the fourth quarter of 2018, the company offered to purchase for cash approximately $6.2 billion of outstanding debt securities from each registered holder of the applicable series of debt securities (the “Tender Offers”). The company retired $4.4 billion aggregate principal amount of such debt securities in connection with the Tender Offers, which expired on December 11, 2018. The retirement of these debt securities was funded with cash contributions from DowDuPont.On March 22, 2019, EID issued notices of redemption in full of all of its outstanding notes (the “Make Whole Notes”) listed in the table below:(in millions)Amount4.625% Notes due 2020$4743.625% Notes due 20212964.250% Notes due 20211632.800% Notes due 20233816.500% Debentures due 2028575.600% Senior Notes due 2036424.900% Notes due 2041484.150% Notes due 204369Total$1,530The Make Whole Notes were redeemed on April 22, 2019 at the make-whole redemption prices set forth in the respective Make Whole Notes. On and after the date of redemption, the Make Whole Notes were no longer deemed outstanding, interest on the Make Whole Notes ceased to accrue and all rights of the holders of the Make Whole Notes were terminated. For further information on the Make Whole Notes, see Note 17 - Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Recent Developments.In March 2016, the company entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (as amended, from time to time, the ""Term Loan Facility"") under which EID could make up to seven term loan borrowings and amounts repaid or prepaid were not available for subsequent borrowings. On May 2, 2019, EID terminated its Term Loan Facility and repaid the aggregate outstanding principal amount of $3 billion plus accrued and unpaid interest through and including May 1, 2019. For further information on the termination of the Term Loan Facility, see Note 17 - Short-Term Borrowings, Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Recent Developments.In connection with the repayment of the Make Whole Notes and the Term Loan Facility, EID paid a total of $4.6 billion in the second quarter 2019, which included breakage fees and accrued and unpaid interest on the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility. The repayment of the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility was funded with cash from operations and a contribution from DowDuPont. On May 7, 2019, DowDuPont publicly announced the record date in connection with the Corteva Distribution. In connection with such announcement, EID was required to redeem $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.200% Notes due 2020 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (collectively, the Special Mandatory Redemption or “SMR Notes”) setting forth the date of redemption of the SMR Notes. The date of redemption was May 17, 2019 and the company paid a total of $2.0 billion, which included accrued and unpaid interest on the SMR Notes. The company funded the payment with a contribution from DowDuPont. Following the redemption, the SMR Notes are no longer outstanding and no longer bear interest and all rights of the holders of the SMR Notes have terminated.The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of which $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2018, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. 62Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The Act required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries (see Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of The Act). Upon actual repatriation, such earnings could be subject to withholding taxes, foreign and / or U.S. state income taxes, and taxes resulting from the impact of foreign currency movements. The Act also introduced a 100 percent dividends received deduction regarding earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. At December 31, 2019, management believed that sufficient liquidity is available in the U.S. SuccessorPredecessor(Dollars in millions)For the Year Ended December 31, 2019For the Year Ended December 31, 2018For the Period September 1 through December 31, 2017For the Period January 1 through August 31, 2017Cash provided by (used for) operating activities$1,070$483$3,674$(3,949)Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1,070 million compared to $483 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower pension contributions in 2019, as a result of the company’s 2018 discretionary pension contribution, and a decrease in integration and separation costs, partially offset by the net impact of lower net income and working capital changes as a result of the Internal Reorganizations and Business Realignments in 2019.Cash provided by operating activities was $3,674 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, primarily driven by Corteva's seasonal cash flows and a tax refund related to voluntary pension contributions made in the Predecessor period, partially offset by transaction costs and the PFOA multi-district litigation settlement, which was primarily paid in September.Cash used for operating activities was $(3,949) million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, primarily driven by pension contributions of $3,024 million, Corteva's seasonal cash flows, transaction costs and tax payments, partially offset by earnings.

Cash provided by investing activities was $3,678 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, primarily driven by approximately $1,200 million of cash received for the FMC Transactions, approximately $1,100 million of cash received for the DAS Divested Ag Business (see Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and net proceeds from investments, partially offset by capital expenditures.Cash used for investing activities was $(2,382) million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, primarily driven by net purchases of investments, capital expenditures, payments for the acquisition of Granular and net payments from foreign currency contracts, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and businesses.Capital expenditures totaled $1,163 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, $1,501 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, $499 million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and $687 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017.

The change was due to repayments of commercial paper and long-term debt and transfers of cash to DowDuPont in connection with the Internal Reorganization and Business Realignments in 2019, partially offset by a net increase in contributions from Dow and DowDuPont, primarily for repayment of long-term debt, and a decrease in distributions to Dow and DowDuPont which were used to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s dividend payments, and in 2018 to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s share repurchases.Cash used for financing activities was $(3,607) million for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, primarily driven by repayments of commercial paper, distributions to Dow and DowDuPont and dividends paid to Historical DuPont shareholders, partially offset by borrowings under the Term Loan. Dividend payments to shareholders of Historical DuPont common stock included a third quarter 2017 dividend declared for common stockholders of record July 31, 2017 and paid in September 2017. Cash provided by financing activities was $5,632 million for the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, primarily driven by a debt offering in May of 2017 as well as borrowings from commercial paper, the Repurchase Facility, and the Term Loan Facility, partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders.In June 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a common stock dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on September 13, 2019, to shareholders of record on July 31, 2019. In October 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a commonstock dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on December 18, 2019, to shareholders of record on November 29, 2019.On June 26, 2019, the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date. The program is expected to be completed in three years. During 2019, the company purchased and retired 824,000 shares for a total cost of $25 million.

The change was due to repayments of commercial paper and long-term debt, transfers of cash to DowDuPont in connection with the Internal Reorganization and Business Realignments in 2019, and a net decrease in contributions from Dow and DuPont, primarily for repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by proceeds received from the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc., and a decrease in distributions to Dow and DowDuPont which were used to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s dividend payments, and in 2018 to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s share repurchases. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Pension Plans and Other Post Employment BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and OPEB plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive.Substantially all of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and OPEB are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S., the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. The company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For non-U.S. benefit plans, historically the company utilized prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. 65Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets. In connection with pension contributions of $2,900 million to its principal U.S. pension plan for the period of January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, an investment policy study was completed for the principal U.S. pension plan. The study resulted in new target asset allocations for the U.S. pension plan with resulting changes to the expected return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 8.00 percent for the Predecessor period to 6.25 percent for the Successor period in 2017.In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. Generally, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months, however, as a result of the Merger, for the Successor periods, the market-related value of assets was calculated by averaging market returns from September 1, 2017 through the respective year ends.The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)December 31, 2019December 31, 2018December 31, 2017Market-related value of assets$16.4$16.6$16.6Fair value of plan assets 16.615.716.7For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and OPEB plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/4 PercentagePointIncrease1/4 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$(35)$28Expected rate of return on plan assets40(40)Additional information with respect to pension and OPEB expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 72 and in Note 20 - Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.66Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Environmental MattersAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2019, the company had accrued obligations of $336 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $51 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (""PRPs"") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to $620 million above that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 3 - Recent Accounting Guidance, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Indemnification Assets The company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by DuPont, Dow, and Chemours. The term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of DuPont, Dow, and / or Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to indemnifications.Income Taxes The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.67Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.At December 31, 2019, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $633 million, inclusive of a valuation allowance of $457 million. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.Valuation of Assets and Impairment ConsiderationsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environment in which the company's segments operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.The company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. As a result of the Internal Reorganizations and Realignments, the company changed its reportable segments to seed and crop protection to reflect the manner in which the company's chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources. The change in reportable segments resulted in changes to the company's reporting units for goodwill impairment testing to align with the level at which discrete financial information is available for review by management. The company’s reporting units include seed, crop protection and digital. In connection with the change in reportable segments and reporting units, goodwill was reassigned from the former agriculture reporting unit to the seed, crop protection and digital reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach. 68Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued For purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.If additional quantitative testing is required, the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge, if any, is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The company determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the income approach or market approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and includes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on its most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts. The company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in the company’s reporting unit valuations ranged from 9.5% to 10.5%. Under the market approach, the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions for comparable companies.Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. The company’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the Merger, and as a result, any declines in projected cash flows or increases in discount rates could have a material, negative impact on the fair value of the company's reporting units and assets and therefore result in an impairment. As discussed above, in connection with the change in reportable segments and reporting units, the company performed a goodwill impairment analysis for the former agriculture reporting unit immediately prior to the realignment and the newly created reporting units immediately after the realignment. The impairment analysis was performed using a discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach), utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs or a market approach. The company’s significant estimates in this analysis include, but are not limited to, future cash flow projections, the weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate, and the tax rate. The company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and planned business strategy. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Based on the goodwill impairment analysis performed both immediately prior to and immediately subsequent to the realignment, the company concluded the fair value of the former agriculture reporting unit and the newly created reporting units exceeded their carrying value, and no goodwill impairment charge was necessary. In the third quarter of 2019, and in connection with strategic product and portfolio reviews, the company determined that the fair value of certain intangible assets classified as developed technology, other intangible assets and IPR&D within the seed segment that primarily relate to heritage DAS intangibles previously acquired from Cooperativa Central de Pesquisa Agrícola's (""Coodetec"") was less than the carrying value due to the company’s focus on advancing more competitive products and eliminating redundancy and complexity across the breeding programs. As a result, the company recorded a pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $54 million ($41 million after-tax). The key assumptions used in determining the fair value of these intangibles involve management judgment and estimates relating to future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual cash flows. Refer to Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Note 23 - Fair Value Measurements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.69Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In the fourth quarter of 2019, quantitative testing was performed on all of the company’s reporting units. Based on the results of the quantitative testing, the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. For the seed reporting unit, the excess fair value over carrying value is approximately 12%, and therefore carries a higher risk of impairment charges in future periods. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified product lines operate, and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, product mix, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors, circumstances and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company also performed an impairment test on indefinite-lived intangibles and determined that the fair value of certain IPR&D assets had declined as a result of the company’s decision to accelerate the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands over the next five years with minimal use of the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® traits thereafter for the remaining term of the non-exclusive license with the Monsanto Company. This resulted in the company concluding that the recoverability of certain IPR&D projects associated with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® were impaired, resulting in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $90 million ($69 million after-tax). Refer to Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Note 23 - Fair Value Measurements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.The company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for the seed reporting unit at December 31, 2019 is shown below (in millions):Reporting UnitGoodwillIndefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsSeed$5,417$1,881Prepaid RoyaltiesThe company’s seed segment currently has certain third-party biotechnology trait license agreements, which require up-front and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions. These payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license. The rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio, market dynamics, farmer preferences, growth rates and projected planted acres. Changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans, including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology, could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty. At December 31, 2019, the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was $440 million and $794 million, respectively. The majority of the balance of prepaid royalties relates to the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.’s (“Pioneer”) non-exclusive license in the United States and Canada for the Monsanto Company's Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® glyphosate tolerance trait and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans (“Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement”). The prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of up-front, fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in Pioneer’s soybean product mix. The company’s historical expectation has been that the technology licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the Pioneer® brand soybean through the term of the agreement. DAS and MS Technologies, L.L.C. jointly developed and own the Enlist E3TM herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2, 4-D choline in Enlist Duo® and Enlist One® herbicides, as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides. In connection with the validation of breeding plans and large-scale product development timelines, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company is accelerating the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands, including Pioneer® brands, over the next five years. During the ramp-up period, the company is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement (the “Transition Plan”). The rate of royalty expense is therefore expected to significantly increase through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty as fewer seeds containing the respective trait are expected to be utilized.70Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In connection with the departure from these traits in the company's product portfolio, beginning January 1, 2020 the company will present and disclose the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a component of restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense will represent the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement. The non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense estimated for 2020 is approximately $160 million, aggregating to approximately $500 million over the next five years. Further changes in factors and assumptions associated with usage of the trait platform licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement, including the Transition Plan, could further impact the rate of recognition of the prepaid royalty and statement of operations presentation of the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.Contractual ObligationsInformation related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In(Dollars in millions)Total atDecember 31, 201920202021-20222023-20242025 andbeyondOperating lease and finance lease obligations1$658$158$216$116$168Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity3724427Long-term debt11111—109Purchase obligations2 Information technology infrastructure & services311714——Raw material obligations1,868485880374129Other85511717—Total purchase obligations1,984553911391129Other liabilities1,3 Pension and other post employment benefits 6,6642985261,3004,540Workers' compensation709261421Environmental remediation3361271265033License agreements467315930215656Other522342544483Total other long-term liabilities7,9666351,0341,5644,733Total contractual obligations6$10,756$1,349$2,166$2,075$5,1661. Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2. Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement.3. The company's contractual obligations do not reflect an offset for recoveries associated with indemnifications by Chemours, Dow, and DuPont in accordance with the Chemours Separation Agreement and the Separation Agreement (related to the Corteva Distribution), respectively. Refer to Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail related to the indemnifications.4. Represents undiscounted remaining payments under Pioneer license agreements ($643 million on a discounted basis). 5. Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other post employment benefits and asset retirement obligations.6. Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.71Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Long-term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other post employment benefits or OPEB plans). Substantially all of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans on November 30, 2018. Therefore, as of November 30, 2018, active employees participating in the U.S. pension plans will not accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received. In addition to the changes to the U.S. pension plans, OPEB eligible employees who will be under the age of 50 as of November 30, 2018 will not receive post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company did not make contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2019. Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $39 million, $103 million, $34 million and $67 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2019, the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively.U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $82 million, $111 million, $35 million and $57 million to its unfunded plans for the year ended December 31, 2019, the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively.The company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $202 million, $216 million, $59 million and $166 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.In 2020, the company expects to contribute approximately $60 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, and about $240 million for its OPEB plans. The company is evaluating potential discretionary contributions in 2020 to the principal U.S. pension plan, that could reduce a portion of the underfunded benefit obligation. Any discretionary contributions depend on various factors including market conditions and tax deductible limits.72Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits: SuccessorPredecessor For the Year Ended December 31, 2019For the Year Ended December 31, 2018For the Period September 1 through December 31, 2017For the Period January 1 through August 31, 2017(Dollars in millions)Net periodic benefit (credit) cost - pension and OPEB$(163)$(186)$(71)$349Defined contributions1151174155Long-term employee benefit plan (credit) charges - continuing operations$(48)$(69)$(30)$404The above (credit) charges for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. Long-term employee credits were $(48) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $(69) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is due to decrease in expected return on plan assets.Activities for the period ended December 31, 2018 and for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 benefited from the absence of the amortization of net losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss. See ""Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 65 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.For 2020, long-term employee benefits credit from continuing operations is expected to increase by about $180 million. The increase is mainly due to lower interest cost.Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below: SuccessorPredecessor(Dollars in millions)For the Year Ended December 31, 2019For the Year Ended December 31, 2018For the Period September 1 through December 31, 2017For the Period January 1 through August 31, 2017Environmental operating costs$136$142$51$67Environmental remediation costs29481651 $165$190$67$118About 85 percent of total pre-tax environmental operating costs charged to income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental operating costs charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. 73Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. Remediation Accrual Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2017$457Remediation payments(55)Net increase in remediation accrual 148Net change, indemnification 2(52)Balance at December 31, 2018$398Remediation payments(49)Net increase in remediation accrual 129Net change, indemnification 2(42)Balance at December 31, 2019$3361.Excludes indemnified remediation obligations.2.Represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from EID's accrued remediation liabilities of obligations that have been fully transferred to Chemours and DuPont. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and the Corteva Separation Agreement, as discussed in Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, EID is indemnified by Chemours and DuPont for certain environmental matters.Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $620 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2019. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. The above noted $336 million accrued obligations includes the following: As of December 31, 2019(In millions)Indemnification AssetAccrual balance3Potential exposure above amount accrued3Environmental Remediation Stray Liabilities Chemours related obligations - subject to indemnity1,2$167$167$285Other discontinued or divested businesses obligations1—91221 Environmental remediation liabilities primarily related to DuPont - subject to indemnity from DuPont2353560 Environmental remediation liabilities not subject to indemnity—4354Total$202$336$6201. Represents liabilities that are subject the $200 million thresholds and sharing arrangements as discussed on page F-61, under Corteva Separation Agreement.2. The company has recorded an indemnification asset related to these accruals, including $30 million related to the Superfund sites.3. Accrual balance represents management’s best estimate of the costs of remediation and restoration, although it is reasonably possible that the potential exposure, as indicated, could range above the amounts accrued, as there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates.74Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued As of December 31, 2019, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (""Superfund"") or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 140 sites for which the company does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at 70 of the 500 sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 210 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at 2 new sites during 2018 compared with 3 notices in 2017. There were no new notices in 2019.Environmental Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were approximately $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $8 million in 2020.Climate ChangeThe company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities. The Board of Directors maintains oversight of these risks and opportunities. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues. The company completed a non-financial materiality assessment and identified short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities. The results of this assessment are integrated into the company’s businesses, strategy and financial planning. Continuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and market-based approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Extreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on customers’ ability to use its products, potentially reducing sales volumes, revenues and margins. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture and mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather. Corteva is working to shrink its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses. The company is seeking ways to reduce its impact and providing tools and incentives for customers to do the same. Corteva champions climate positive agriculture, utilizing carbon storage and other means to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits without sacrificing farmer productivity or ongoing profitability. The company is developing metrics and targets that will be used to assess and manage material and relevant climate-related risks and opportunities. The company is committed to engaging with multiple stakeholders and partners around the globe who have innovative and actionable ideas to help safeguard the health and well-being of the planet and its people. The company integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its overall risk management. By doing more to address climate change today, the company is fortifying its ability to grow food, grow progress and build a sustainable industry that will help humanity thrive for generations to come.75Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts may be used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks The company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the Brazilian Real, European Euro (""EUR""), Canadian dollar and Indian rupee. The company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar (""USD"") amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service Corteva and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global product lines.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by region.76Part II",2023-12-30 21:52:13.180917

This unaudited pro forma financial information, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 assumes the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For additional information, see the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information in this section.36Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Overview The following is a summary of results from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020:•The company reported net sales of $14,217 million, an increase of 3 percent versus the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting a 5 percent increase in volume and a 3 percent increase in local price, partially offset by a 5 percent decline in currency. Volume and price gains were driven by continued penetration of new products.•Cost of goods sold (""COGS"") totaled $8,507 million, down from $8,575 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by currency benefits, $272 million of amortization of inventory step-up included in the year ended December 31, 2019 and ongoing cost and productivity actions, partially offset by increased volumes and higher input costs.•Restructuring and asset related charges - net were $335 million, an increase from $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The year ended December 31, 2020 included $159 million of non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense related to Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits.•There were no integration and separation costs in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $744 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.•The benefit from income taxes on continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 includes a $(182) million tax benefit associated with the recognition of an elective cantonal component of the recent enactment of the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (""Swiss Tax Reform"") and a tax benefit of $(51) million related to a return to accrual adjustment associated with an elective change in accounting method for the 2019 tax year impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 's (“The Act”) foreign tax provisions.•Income from continuing operations after income taxes was $756 million, as compared to a loss of $(270) million for the year ended December 31, 2019.•Operating EBITDA was $2,087 million, up from $1,987 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by volume and price gains in both seed and crop protection, as well as ongoing execution on cost and productivity actions. The company realized cost and productivity savings of approximately $230 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which were mostly offset by higher input costs and investments to fund growth and advance the pipeline. Currency net of pricing was a $180 million headwind, inclusive of $150 million in pricing actions. Refer to page 59 for further discussion of the company's Non-GAAP financial measures.In addition to the financial highlights above, the following events occurred during or subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2020: •The company returned more than $660 million to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2020 under its previously announced share repurchase program and through common stock dividends.•On February 1, 2021, Corteva approved restructuring actions designed to right-size and optimize footprint and organizational structure according to the business needs in each region with the focus on driving continued cost improvement and productivity. Corteva expects to record total pre-tax restructuring and asset-related charges of approximately $130 million to $170 million, comprised of approximately $40 million to $50 million of severance and related benefit costs, $40 million to $60 million of asset related charges, $10 million to $15 million of asset retirement obligations and $40 million to $45 million of costs related to contract terminations. Future cash payments related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $90 million to $110 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits, asset retirement obligations, and costs related to contract terminations. The restructuring actions associated with this charge are expected to be substantially complete in 2021. 37Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Priorities The company believes the following priorities will enable it to create significant value for its customers while delivering strong financial returns to its shareholders: •Deliver organic sales growth by continuing to leverage its industry-leading innovation pipeline to introduce new proprietary seed traits and crop protection formulations that anticipate and meet evolving customer needs and utilizing its comprehensive multi-channel, multi-brand strategy to align its brands and capabilities across different sales channels. •Drive actions to expand margins in the company's reportable segments by integrating its operations and continuing to drive operating efficiencies, enabling a streamlined, efficient and focused organization while working to achieve a best-in-class cost structure and creating a strong culture based on productivity.•Accelerate the return of cash to shareholders by executing on its authorized share repurchase programs as the company repurchased $300 million under its share buyback plan since the Corteva Distribution and expects to repurchase the remaining $700 million in 2021. The timing, price and volume of purchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. 38Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of Operations COVID-19 PandemicOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. Since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, Corteva has taken steps to help protect the health and safety of its employees, customers, vendors, and stakeholders. Corteva has engaged crisis management teams at the country, regional and global level, and its Integrated Health Services Pandemic & Infectious Disease Planning Team has been monitoring the situation and developing guidelines and protocols that have been communicated to all of its employees globally.Overwhelmingly, countries and U.S. states have considered agriculture an “essential business”; therefore, Corteva is not subject to many of the restrictions imposed by the government, particularly on non-essential businesses, which, in certain cases, includes ordering businesses to close or limit operations or people to stay at home. While the company's business has experienced some localized operating disruptions, particularly around sourcing and logistics, these disruptions have been temporary and have not materially impacted the company's financial results. Additionally, the company has implemented mitigating strategies to limit the impact of supply chain disruptions, including leveraging the company’s ability to use a multi-sourcing strategy and source key raw materials from multiple suppliers and countries. Furthermore, the company implemented remote work arrangements for non-essential employees and restricted business travel effective mid-March 2020, and to date, these arrangements have not materially affected the company's ability to maintain its business operations, including the operation of financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting, and disclosure controls and procedures.The global health crisis caused by COVID-19 and the related government actions and stay at home orders have negatively impacted economic activity and increased political instability across the globe. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the company observed declining demand and price reductions in the oil and gas sector as business and consumer activity decelerated across the globe, which had impacted the price of corn. When COVID-19 is demonstrably contained, the company anticipates a rebound in economic activity, depending on the rate, pace, and effectiveness of the containment efforts deployed by various national, state, and local governments. Corteva will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering its business operations that it determines are in the best interests of its stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on the company's business, including the effects on its customers, employees, and prospects, or on its financial results for 2021 and beyond. With the increasing uncertainty in global markets, the company will continue to monitor various factors that could impact mid-term forecasted cash flows of the business, including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, expectations of future planted area (as influenced by consumer demand, ethanol markets and government policies and regulations), trade and purchasing of commodities globally and relative commodity prices.Execute to Win Productivity ProgramDuring the first quarter of 2020, Corteva approved restructuring actions designed to improve productivity through optimizing certain operational and organizational structures primarily related to the Execute to Win Productivity Program. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $176 million, comprised of $113 million of asset related charges, and $63 million of severance and related benefit costs. The Company does not anticipate any additional material charges from the Execute to Win Program as actions associated with this charge are substantially complete. Future cash payments related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $77 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits and asset retirement obligations. The company expects $130 million of savings to be achieved on a run rate basis by 2023. See Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.Share Buyback PlanOn June 26, 2019, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date. The company repurchased $300 million under its share buyback plan since the Corteva Distribution and expects to repurchase the remaining $700 million in 2021. The timing, price and volume of purchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the company purchased and retired 8,503,000 shares for a total cost of $275 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the company purchased and retired 824,000 shares in the open market for a total cost of $25 million.39Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Impact From Previously Enacted TariffsIn 2018, certain countries where the company’s products are manufactured, distributed or sold previously enacted tariffs on certain products. The tariffs contributed to an expected shift to soybeans from corn in Latin America and pressured North American farmer margins. These expectations were reflected in the revised long-term cash flow projections for the company's agriculture reporting unit in 2018, as discussed in Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2020 the United States and China signed ""phase one"" of a trade agreement (""China Trade Agreement"") and the United States (""U.S.""), Mexico and Canada ratified the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (""USMCA""). On July 2, 2020, the USMCA went into effect. The China Trade Agreement commits China to purchase at least $40 billion worth of U.S. farm goods annually and for China to reduce non-tariff barriers to agriculture products such as poultry and feed additives, as well as approval of biotechnology products. Additionally, the China Trade Agreement includes stronger intellectual property protections and the elimination of any pressure for foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms as a condition of market access. While the USMCA will replace the North America Free Trade Agreement, it is not a one-for-one replacement. It is designed to modernize trade rules in North America, ensure open markets, protect innovations for a majority of U.S. goods, and enhance sanitary/phytosanitary standards. The company expects the impacts of these agreements to overall be positive for demand for U.S. agriculture products.Tax ReformOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“The Act”) was enacted. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax (“transition tax”) on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, created new provisions related to foreign sourced earnings, eliminated the domestic manufacturing deduction and moved to a territorial system. As of December 31, 2018, the company had completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act. As a result of The Act, the company remeasured its U.S. federal deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent. The company recorded a cumulative benefit of $(2,847) million (which includes a $(34) million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018) to provision for (benefit from) income taxes on continuing operations in the company's Consolidated Statement of Operations with respect to the remeasurement of the company's deferred tax balances. Additionally, the company recorded a cumulative charge of $928 million (which includes a $182 million charge for the year ended December 31, 2018) to provision for (benefit from) income taxes on continuing operations with respect to the one-time transition tax. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, The Act introduced new provisions for U.S. taxation of certain global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). The Company has made the policy election to record any liability associated with GILTI in the period in which it is incurred. Additional details related to The Act can be found in Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.DowDuPont Agriculture Division Restructuring Program During the fourth quarter of 2018 and in connection with the ongoing integration activities, DowDuPont approved restructuring actions to simplify and optimize certain organizational structures in preparation for the Business Separations. From inception-to-date, the company recorded total net pre-tax restructuring charges of $70 million, comprised of $61 million of severance and related benefit costs and $9 million of asset-related charges. The actions related to this program were complete in 2019. See Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.DowDuPont Cost Synergy ProgramIn September and November 2017, DowDuPont and EID approved post-merger restructuring actions under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the “Synergy Program”), adopted at the time by the DowDuPont Board of Directors. The Synergy Program was designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the Business Separations. The company recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $845 million from inception-to-date under the Synergy Program, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $317 million, contract termination costs of $193 million, and asset-related charges of $335 million. Actions associated with the Synergy Program, including employee separations, are substantially complete.The company anticipates including cumulative savings associated with these actions within its cost synergy commitment of $1.2 billion through 2021. See Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.40Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Net SalesFor the Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 202020192018Net Sales$14,217 $13,846 $14,287 2020 versus 2019Net sales were $14,217 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $13,846 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Volume increased 5 percent versus the year-ago period, primarily driven by sales of new and differentiated products globally and across both segments. Local price grew 3 percent on a full-year basis, with higher prices in all regions, led by Latin America partly to offset currency. Currency represented a headwind of 5 percent, led by the impact of the Brazilian Real. 2019 versus 2018Net sales were $13,846 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $14,287 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a 3 percent decline in currency. Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily driven by the Brazilian Real and the Euro. Volume was flat as strong demand for new product and gains in corn in EMEA were offset by significant weather-related planting delays in North America, resulting in lost spring applications of crop protection products and a reduction in planted area for soybeans. Pricing gains from new product launches and favorable mix in Latin America were offset by competitive pricing pressure, increases in replant, and increased grower incentive program discounts in North America.

The decrease was primarily driven by currency benefits, lack of inventory step-up in 2020 as compared to $272 million recognized in 2019, and ongoing cost and productivity actions. The decrease was partially offset by increased volumes, higher input costs in both seed and crop protection and higher royalties in seed. Amortization of inventory step-up was 2 percent of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.COGS was $8,507 million (60 percent of net sales) on an as reported basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8,386 million (61 percent of net sales) on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by increased volumes, higher input costs in both seed and crop protection and higher royalties in seed, partially offset by the above noted currency benefits and ongoing cost and productivity actions. 2019 versus 2018COGS was $8,575 million (62 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $9,948 million (70 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower amortization of remaining inventory step up compared to the prior year ($272 million in 2019 compared to $1,554 million in 2018). The amortization of inventory step-up was 2 percent and 11 percent of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The remaining COGS decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes as a result of weather-related planting delays in North America, cost synergies and a currency benefit, partially offset by higher input costs for both seed and crop protection. On a pro forma basis, COGS was $8,386 million (61 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $8,449 million (59 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes as a result of weather-related planting delays in North America, cost synergies and a currency benefit, partially offset by higher input costs for both seed and crop protection. The increase was due to higher input costs for both seed and crop protection, partially offset by cost synergies.42Part IIITEM 7.

Pro forma SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3,068 million (22 percent of net sales) compared to $3,042 million (21 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the factors described above. 43Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Amortization of IntangiblesFor the Year Ended December 31,(In millions) 202020192018Amortization of Intangibles$682 $475 $391 2020 versus 2019Intangible asset amortization was $682 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $475 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the full year impact of germplasm assets, which changed from an indefinite lived intangible asset to a definite lived with a useful life of 25 years in the fourth quarter of 2019. The remaining increase in amortization expense is primarily due to amortization of the trade name asset that was changed from an indefinite lived intangible asset to definite lived in the fourth quarter of 2020. Beginning in 2021, the company expects annual amortization expense to increase by approximately $55 million, as a result of the change in useful life for trade name asset. See Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information for above items. 2019 versus 2018Intangible asset amortization was $475 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $391 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by amortization of germplasm assets, which changed from an indefinite lived intangible asset to definite lived with a useful life of 25 years in fourth quarter of 2019. The remaining increase in amortization expense is primarily due to the reclassification of amounts from indefinite-lived in-process research and development (""IPR&D"") to developed technology as a result of the company's launch of its Qrome® corn hybrids following the receipt of regulatory approval from China. See Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information for above items.

The $92 million net charge associated with the Synergy Program was comprised of $69 million of contract termination charges and $30 million of asset related charges, partially offset by a $7 million benefit on the reduction of severance and related benefit costs. The $14 million net benefit associated with the DowDuPont Agriculture Division Restructuring Program included a $17 million benefit on the reduction of severance and related benefit costs, partially offset by $3 million of asset related charges.Asset ImpairmentFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the company recognized a $144 million pre-tax ($110 million after-tax) non-cash impairment charge in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the company's Consolidated Statements of Operations related to certain IPR&D assets within the seed segment.

These costs primarily have consisted of financial advisory, information technology, legal, accounting, consulting, and other professional advisory fees associated with the preparation and execution of activities related to the Business Separations and the integration of EID’s Pioneer and Crop Protection businesses with DAS. Pro forma integration and separation costs were $632 million and $571 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in financial advisory, information technology, legal, accounting, consulting, and other professional advisory fees associated with the preparation and execution of activities related to the Business Separations and the integration of EID’s Pioneer and Crop Protection businesses with DAS. Goodwill Impairment ChargeFor the Year Ended December 31,(In millions) 202020192018Goodwill Impairment Charge$— $— $4,503 The company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $4,503 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to a goodwill impairment test for its agriculture reporting unit.

The increase in non-operating pension and other employment benefit credits was offset by higher net exchange loss as well as net losses on sales of businesses and other assets for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net gains in 2019 and a change in miscellaneous income. Other income - net for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $(53) million loss on the expected sale of the La Porte site (see below for gains and losses on divestitures for the year ended December 31, 2019). See Note 9 - Supplementary Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.2019 versus 2018Other income - net was income of $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and income of $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in non-operating pension and other post employment credits and interest income, partially offset by a change in miscellaneous income and lower net exchange losses. Additionally, other income - net for the year ended December 31, 2019 included gains on divestitures in the crop protection segment of approximately $70 million partially offset by a loss on a divestiture in the seed segment of $(24) million. The company routinely uses forward exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The objective of this program is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies in order to minimize, on an after-tax basis, the effects of exchange rate changes. The net pre-tax exchange gains and losses are recorded in other income - net and the related tax impact is recorded in provision for (benefit from) income taxes on continuing operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 9 - Supplementary Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The loss for 2019 related to the difference between the redemption price and the par value of the Make Whole Notes, the Term Loan Facility, and the Special Mandatory Redemption (""SMR"") Notes, partially offset by the write-off of unamortized step-up related to the fair value step-up of EID’s debt. The loss for 2018 was primarily related to the difference between the redemption price and the aggregate amount of the Tender Notes purchased in the Tender Offer, mostly offset by the write-off of unamortized step-up related to the fair value step-up of EID’s debt.

The change was primarily driven by lower average debt balances as a result of the redemption/repayment transactions in the second quarter of 2019 related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (refer to Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and lower average interest rates.2019 versus 2018 Interest expense was $136 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $337 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was primarily driven by lower average long-term debt balances during 2019 due to debt redemption/repayment transactions. Pro forma interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $91 million compared to $76 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

EID Analysis of OperationsAs discussed in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements, EID is a subsidiary of Corteva, Inc. and continues to be a reporting company, subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The below relates to EID only and is presented to provide an Analysis of Operations, only for the differences between EID and Corteva, Inc.Interest Expense2020 versus 2019 EID’s interest expense was $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, the decrease was driven by the items noted on page 47, under the header ""Interest Expense - 2020 versus 2019,"" and by lower interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 2019 versus 2018 EID’s interest expense was $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $337 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by the items noted on page 47 under the header “Interest Expense - 2019 versus 2018,” partially offset by interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc.

See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Corporate Outlook Global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong with some production challenges in key global producing regions, reducing global stocks of corn and soybeans. The company anticipates a modest increase in the U.S. corn and soybean area, with the increase heavily biased towards soybeans.The company expects approximately 2 percent increase in net sales, driven by new product sales, partially offset by currency and portfolio headwinds. The company expects Operating EBITDA to increase approximately 15 - 20 percent and Operating Earnings Per Share to increase approximately 23 - 30 percent, driven by new product sales and ongoing cost savings and productivity actions, 49Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued partially offset by expected increased input costs due to rising commodity prices and expected unfavorable yields in Europe. Refer to further discussion of Non-GAAP metrics on pages 59 - 61.The above outlook does not contemplate any operational disruptions, significant changes in customers' demand or ability to pay, or further acceleration of currency impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Corteva is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty items outside of the company’s control, such as Significant Items, without unreasonable effort (refer to page 60 for Significant Items recorded in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018). In February 2021 the company approved a restructuring program, in which it expects to record total pre-tax restructuring and asset-related charges of approximately $130 million to $170 million (for further discussion refer to page 37), with actions expected to be substantially completed in 2021; and, in 2021, the company expects non-operating benefits - net, to be approximately $930 million higher, as a result of amendments to the OPEB plans and a decrease in the discount rate, partly offset by a change in expected return on plan assets, and expects an increase in amortization expense. Refer to Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to the company's discussion on Long-term Employee Benefits on page 74. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2020, the company recognizes non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a restructuring and asset related charge. For further discussion of accelerated prepaid royalty amortization refer to the Company's Critical Accounting Estimates for Prepaid Royalties on page 71.50Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial InformationThe supplemental unaudited pro forma statements of operations (the ""unaudited pro forma statements of operations"") for Corteva for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 give effect to the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For the periods presented below, Corteva’s results for all periods prior to the Business Realignment and Internal Reorganization consist of the combined results of operations for Historical EID and DAS, and Corteva’s results for all periods after the Business Realignment and Internal Reorganization represent the consolidated balances of the company. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations below were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X that was in effect prior to recent amendments, and events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., amortization of inventory step-up costs) are excluded. One-time transaction-related costs incurred prior to, or concurrent with, the closing of the Merger, the debt redemptions/repayments, and the Corteva Distribution are not included in the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations through March 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations do not reflect restructuring or integration activities or other costs, that were not already reflected in GAAP results, following the separation and distribution transactions that may be incurred to achieve cost or growth synergies of Corteva. As no assurance can be made that these costs will be incurred or the growth synergies will be achieved, no adjustment has been made.The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what Corteva’s results of operations actually would have been had the above transactions been completed on January 1, 2016. In addition, the unaudited pro forma statements of operations do not purport to project the future operating results of the company.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 3 - Recent Accounting Guidance, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. Segment Reviews The company operates in two reportable segments: seed and crop protection. The company’s seed segment is a global leader in developing and supplying advanced germplasm and traits that produce optimum yield for farms around the world. The segment offers trait technologies that improve resistance to weather, disease, insects and weeds, and trait technologies that enhance food and nutritional characteristics, and also provides digital solutions that assist farmer decision-making with a view to optimize product selection and, ultimately, maximize yield and profitability. The segment competes in a wide variety of agricultural markets. The crop protection segment serves the global agricultural input industry with products that protect against weeds, insects and other pests, and disease, and that improve overall crop health both above and below ground via nitrogen management and seed-applied technologies. The segment is a leader in global herbicides, insecticides, nitrogen stabilizers and pasture and range management herbicides.Summarized below are comments on individual segment net sales and segment operating EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, segment operating EBITDA is calculated on a pro forma basis, as this is the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") assesses performance and allocates resources. Pro forma adjustments used in the calculation of pro forma segment operating EBITDA were determined in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X that was in effect prior to recent amendments. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, these adjustments give effect to the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016 (refer to supplemental unaudited pro forma financial statements on page 51). The company defines segment operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., income from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, corporate expenses, non-operating costs-net and foreign exchange gains (losses), excluding the impact of significant items (including goodwill impairment charges). Non-operating costs-net consists of non-operating pension and OPEB costs, tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy EID businesses and sites. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. See Note 25 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to significant pre-tax (charges) benefits excluded from segment operating EBITDA. All references to prices are based on local price unless otherwise specified.A reconciliation of segment operating EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations after income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is included in Note 25 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 54Part IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued SeedSeed net sales were $7,756 million in 2020, up 2 percent from $7,590 million in 2019. The increase was driven by a 5 percent increase in volume and 1 percent increase in local price, partially offset by a 4 percent unfavorable impact from currency. Volume growth was driven by the recovery of soybean planted area in North America and strong summer and Safrinha sales in Brazil. Global corn price grew 2 percent year over year, primarily driven by continued penetration from products such as Qrome® and PowerCore ULTRATM. North America soybean price increased 2 percent versus the year-ago period due to superior product performance and strong execution. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real. Seed operating EBITDA was $1,208 million in 2020, up 16 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $1,040 million in 2019. Favorable mix, volume gains and ongoing cost and productivity actions more than offset the unfavorable impact of currency, higher input costs and higher royalties.Seed net sales were $7,590 million in 2019, down from $7,842 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 2 percent decline in currency and a 1 percent decline in volume. Local price was flat. Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to the Brazilian Real, Eastern European currencies, and the Euro. Volume gains in corn in EMEA were more than offset by significant weather-related planting delays in North America, leading to a reduction in planted area for soybeans, and multi-channel and multi-brand rationalization impacts in North America. Competitive pricing pressure in soybeans in the U.S. and increased soybean and corn replant in North America were offset by favorable mix and continued penetration of PowerCore Ultra® in Latin America.Seed pro forma operating EBITDA was $1,040 million in 2019, down 9 percent from $1,139 million in 2018. Competitive pricing pressure, the unfavorable impact of currency, increased commissions and input costs, and volume declines more than offset cost synergies and ongoing productivity.56Part IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Crop Protection Crop protection net sales were $6,461 million in 2020, up from $6,256 million in 2019. Sales gains were driven by a 7 percent increase in volume and a 4 percent increase in local price, which was partially offset by a 7 percent impact from currency and a 1 percent impact from portfolio. The increase in volume was driven by continued penetration of new products globally, with combined sales of $1 billion in 2020, up $265 million compared to the prior-year period, led by EnlistTM, ArylexTM, and RinskorTM herbicides and IsoclastTM insecticide. Local price growth was driven by increases in Latin America to offset currency, coupled with favorable mix globally from new product launches. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real. The Company has recognized approximately $150 million in pricing to offset the weakening Brazilian Real for the full year. The portfolio impact was driven by divestitures in Asia Pacific and North America.Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $1,004 million in 2020, down from pro forma segment operating EBITDA of $1,066 million in 2019. Favorable mix, ongoing cost and productivity actions, together with volume gains, were more than offset by the negative impact of currency, increased investment to fund growth and higher input costs. Currency net of pricing was a $70 million headwind, inclusive of $150 million in pricing actions.Crop protection net sales were $6,256 million in 2019, down from $6,445 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 3 percent decline in currency and a 1 percent decline in portfolio, partially offset by a 1 percent increase in volume. Local price was flat.Unfavorable currency impacts were primarily due to Brazilian Real and the Euro. Volume gains driven by new product launches - including EnlistTM and ArylexTM herbicides and IsoclastTM insecticide - were partially offset by the unfavorable weather in North America, which resulted in lost spring applications. Pricing gains from new products launches were offset by increased grower incentive program discounts in North America. The portfolio impact was driven by divestitures in North America and Asia Pacific.Crop Protection pro forma operating EBITDA was $1,066 million in 2019, down 1 percent from $1,074 million in 2018. Volume declines in North America, the unfavorable impact of currency, and higher input costs more than offset cost synergies, sales from new products, and ongoing productivity.58Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe company presents certain financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include Operating EBITDA and operating earnings per share. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and a more useful comparison of year over year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the company's U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP are provided below. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, information is on a pro forma basis and these non-GAAP measures are being reconciled to a pro forma GAAP financial measure prepared and presented in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X that was in effect prior to recent amendments, which are reconciled to the GAAP reported figures. See Article 11 Pro Forma Combined Statements of Operations on page 52.Operating EBITDA is defined as earnings (i.e., income from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating (benefits) costs - net and foreign exchange gains (losses), net, excluding the impact of significant items (including goodwill impairment charges). Non-operating (benefits) costs - net consists of non-operating pension and OPEB credits, tax indemnification adjustments and environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy businesses and sites of Historical DuPont. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. Operating earnings per share is defined as ""Earnings per common share from continuing operations - diluted"" excluding the after-tax impact of significant items (including goodwill impairment charges), the after-tax impact of non-operating (benefits) costs - net, and the after-tax impact of amortization expense associated with intangible assets existing as of the Separation from DowDuPont. Although amortization of the company's intangible assets is excluded from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in amortization of additional intangible assets.Reconciliation of Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations after Income Taxes to Operating EBITDAYear Ended December 31, 202020192018(In millions)As ReportedPro FormaPro FormaIncome from continuing operations after income taxes $756 $26 $(4,937)(Benefit from) provision for income taxes on continuing operations(81)1 395 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 675 27 (4,542)Depreciation and amortization1,177 1,000 909 Interest income(56)(59)(86)Interest expense45 91 76 Exchange losses - net174 66 77 Non-operating benefits - net(316)(129)(211)Goodwill impairment charge— — 4,503 Significant items charge388 991 1,346 Operating EBITDA (Non-GAAP)$2,087 $1,987 $2,072 59Part IIITEM 7.

Unless specifically addressed above, the income tax effect on significant items was calculated based upon the enacted tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying non-GAAP adjustment.2.The tax only significant item benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects the impacts of the recognition of an elective cantonal component of the recent enactment of the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (""Swiss Tax Reform"") ($(182) million benefit) and a benefit due to an elective change in accounting method that alters the 2019 impact of the business separation on The Act's foreign tax provisions ($(29) million benefit), partially offset by a state tax valuation allowance in the U.S. based on a change in judgment about the realizability of a deferred tax asset ($19 million charge). The tax only significant item benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects the impacts of Swiss Tax Reform ($(38) million benefit) and the release of a tax valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset position of a Swiss legal entity ($(34) million benefit). The tax only significant item charge for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform ($361 million charge), a tax valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax asset position of a Brazilian legal entity ($75 million charge), as well as the Internal Reorganizations and Business Separations ($25 million charge), partially offset by impacts of the company's discretionary pension contribution ($(114) million benefit).Reconciliation of Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Corteva and Earnings (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock from Continuing Operations - Diluted to Operating Earnings and Operating Earnings Per ShareYear Ended December 31,202020192018(In millions)As ReportedPro FormaPro FormaIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Corteva$736 $13 $(4,966)Less: Non-operating benefits - net, after tax237 100 165 Less: Amortization of intangibles (existing as of Separation), after tax(518)(376)(313)Less: Goodwill impairment charge, after tax— — (4,503)Less: Significant items charge, after tax(110)(784)(1,454)Operating Earnings (Non-GAAP)$1,127 $1,073 $1,139 60Part IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund its operations, including seasonal working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases and pension contributions. Corteva's strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings will provide access as needed to capital markets and commercial paper markets to fund seasonal working capital needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing and committed receivable repurchase facilities. Corteva considers the borrowing costs and lending terms when selecting the source to fund its operations and working capital needs.The company had access to approximately $6.4 billion in committed and uncommitted unused credit lines at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. These facilities provide support to meet the company’s short-term liquidity needs and for general corporate purposes which may include funding of discretionary and non-discretionary contributions to certain benefit plans, severance payments, repayment and refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases and redemptions of securities and funding Corteva's costs and expenses. On January 22, 2021, Chemours, DuPont, Corteva and EID entered into a binding memorandum of understanding containing a settlement to resolve legal disputes originating from the Delaware Litigation and Pending Arbitration, and to establish a cost sharing arrangement and escrow account to be used to support and manage potential future legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) liabilities arising out of pre-July 1, 2015 conduct (the “MOU”). The MOU replaces the 2017 amendment to the Chemours Separation Agreement (refer to Footnote 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details). According to the terms of the cost sharing arrangement within the MOU, Corteva and DuPont together, on one hand, and Chemours, on the other hand, agreed to a 50-50 split of certain qualified expenses related to PFAS liabilities incurred over a term not to exceed twenty years or $4 billion of qualified spend and escrow account contributions in the aggregate. DuPont’s and Corteva’s 50% share under the MOU will be limited to $2 billion, including qualified expenses and escrow contributions (see below for discussion of escrow contributions). These expenses and escrow account contributions will be subject to the existing Letter Agreement, under which DuPont and Corteva will each bear 50% of the first $300 million (up to $150 million each), and thereafter DuPont bears 71% and Corteva bears the remaining 29%. In order to support and manage any potential future PFAS liabilities, the parties have also agreed to establish an escrow account. The MOU provides that (1) no later than each of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022, Chemours shall deposit $100 million into an escrow account and DuPont and Corteva shall together deposit $100 million in the aggregate into an escrow account and (2) no later than September 30 of each subsequent year through and including 2028, Chemours shall deposit $50 million into an escrow account and DuPont and Corteva shall together deposit $50 million in the aggregate into an escrow account. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the MOU, each party may be permitted to defer funding in any year (excluding 2021). Over this period, Chemours will deposit a total of $500 million in the account and DuPont and Corteva will deposit an additional $500 million pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement. Additionally, if on December 31, 2028, the balance of the escrow account (including interest) is less than $700 million, Chemours will make 50% of the deposits and DuPont and Corteva together will make 50% of the deposits necessary to restore the balance of the escrow account to $700 million. Such payments will be made in a series of consecutive annual equal installments commencing on September 30, 2029 pursuant to the escrow account replenishment terms as set forth in the MOU (refer to Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the MOU and Letter Agreement).In November 2018, EID entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 Revolving Credit Facilities”). The 2018 Revolving Credit Facilities became effective May 2019 in connection with the termination of the EID $4.5 billion Term Loan Facility and the $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility dated May 2014. Corteva, Inc. became a party to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facilities upon the Corteva Distribution. In March 2020, the company drew down $500 million under the three year revolving credit facility to finance its short term liquidity needs as a result of the volatility and increased borrowing costs of commercial paper resulting from the unstable market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and repaid that borrowing in full in June 2020. The Revolving Credit Facilities contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. The Revolving Credit Facilities also contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At December 31, 2020 the company was in compliance with these covenants.62Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In May 2020, EID issued $500 million of 1.70 percent Senior Notes due 2025 and $500 million of 2.30 percent Senior Notes due 2030 (the May 2020 Debt Offering). The proceeds of this offering are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include discretionary contributions to the company’s U.S. principal pension plan and repayment of other indebtedness.The company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations affecting manufacturing plants, mineral producing properties or research facilities located in the U.S. and the consolidated subsidiaries owning such plants, properties and facilities subject to certain limitations. The outstanding long-term debt also contains customary default provisions.The company has meaningful seasonal working capital needs based in part on providing financing to its customers. Working capital is funded through multiple methods including commercial paper, a receivable repurchase facility, factoring and cash from operations.In February 2020, in line with seasonal working capital requirements, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase agreement of up to $1.3 billion (the ""2020 Repurchase Facility"") which expired in December 2020. Under the 2020 Repurchase Facility, the company sold a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables to participating institutions and simultaneously agreed to repurchase at a future date. In February 2021, the company entered into a new committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $1 billion (the ""2021 Repurchase Facility"") which expires in December 2021. See further discussion of the 2021 Repurchase Facility in Note 27 - Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The company has factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions primarily in Latin America to sell its trade receivables under both recourse and non-recourse agreements in exchange for cash proceeds in an effort to reduce its receivables risk. For arrangements that include an element of recourse, the company provides a guarantee of the trade receivables in the event of customer default. Refer to Note 12 - Accounts and Notes Receivable - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.The company also organizes agreements with third-party financial institutions who directly provide financing for select customers of its seed and crop protection products in each region. Terms of the third-party loans are less than a year and programs are renewed on an annual basis. In some cases, the company guarantees a portion of the extension of such credit to such customers. Refer to Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the company’s guarantees.Capacity ExpansionDuring 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a capital investment of approximately $145 million to increase Spinosyns fermentation capacity by 30% to address global market growth in insecticides that handle chewing insects in specialty and row crops. The additional capacity was staged to come online over the subsequent next few years.Debt Redemptions/RepaymentsIn the fourth quarter of 2018, EID offered to purchase for cash approximately $6.2 billion of outstanding debt securities from each registered holder of the applicable series of debt securities (the “Tender Offers”). EID retired $4.4 billion aggregate principal amount of such debt securities in connection with the Tender Offers, which expired on December 11, 2018. The retirement of these debt securities was funded with cash contributions from DowDuPont.63Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued On March 22, 2019, EID issued notices of redemption in full of all of its outstanding notes (the “Make Whole Notes”) listed in the table below:(in millions)Amount4.625% Notes due 2020$474 3.625% Notes due 20212964.250% Notes due 20211632.800% Notes due 20233816.500% Debentures due 2028575.600% Senior Notes due 2036424.900% Notes due 2041484.150% Notes due 204369Total$1,530 The Make Whole Notes were redeemed on April 22, 2019 at the make-whole redemption prices set forth in the respective Make Whole Notes. On and after the date of redemption, the Make Whole Notes were no longer deemed outstanding, interest on the Make Whole Notes ceased to accrue and all rights of the holders of the Make Whole Notes were terminated. For further information on the Make Whole Notes, see Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2016, EID entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (as amended, from time to time, the ""Term Loan Facility"") under which EID could make up to seven term loan borrowings and amounts repaid or prepaid were not available for subsequent borrowings. On May 2, 2019, EID terminated its Term Loan Facility and repaid the aggregate outstanding principal amount of $3 billion plus accrued and unpaid interest through and including May 1, 2019. For further information on the termination of the Term Loan Facility, see Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In connection with the repayment of the Make Whole Notes and the Term Loan Facility, EID paid a total of $4.6 billion in the second quarter 2019, which included breakage fees and accrued and unpaid interest on the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility. The repayment of the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility was funded with cash from operations and a contribution from DowDuPont. On May 7, 2019, DowDuPont publicly announced the record date in connection with the Corteva Distribution. In connection with such announcement, EID was required to redeem $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.200% Notes due 2020 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (collectively, the Special Mandatory Redemption or “SMR Notes”) setting forth the date of redemption of the SMR Notes. The date of redemption was May 17, 2019 and EID paid a total of $2.0 billion, which included accrued and unpaid interest on the SMR Notes. The company funded the payment with a contribution from DowDuPont. Following the redemption, the SMR Notes are no longer outstanding and no longer bear interest and all rights of the holders of the SMR Notes have terminated.The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of which $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2019, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. The Act required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries (see Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of The Act). As a result of The Act's introduction of a 100 percent dividends received deduction regarding earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. Upon actual repatriation, such earnings could be subject to withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes, and taxes resulting from the impact of foreign currency movements. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. At December 31, 2020, management believed that it will have sufficient liquidity sources to fund operating needs in the U.S. with 64Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued global operating cash flows, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities, and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets. For the Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions)202020192018Cash provided by operating activities$2,064 $1,070 $483 Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,064 million compared to $1,070 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by an increase in net income, including a decrease in integration and separation costs, and improvement in working capital, partially offset by the absence of the net impact of cash earnings from EID ECP and EID Specialty Products entities, as a result of the Internal Reorganizations and Business Realignments in 2019.Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1,070 million compared to $483 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by lower pension contributions in 2019, as a result of the company’s 2018 discretionary pension contribution, and a decrease in integration and separation costs, partially offset by the net impact of lower net income and working capital changes as a result of the Internal Reorganizations and Business Realignments in 2019.For the Year Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions)202020192018Cash used for investing activities$(674)$(904)$(505)Cash used for investing activities was $(674) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $(904) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was due primarily due to lower capital expenditures driven by the Internal Reorganizations and Business Realignments in 2019, partially offset by higher net purchases of investments and lower proceeds from sales of property, businesses, and consolidated companies. Cash used for investing activities was $(904) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $(505) million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures as a result of the Internal Reorganizations and Business Realignments in 2019 and an increase in proceeds from sales of property, businesses and consolidated companies. Capital expenditures totaled $475 million, $1,163 million, and $1,501 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes capital expenditures of $497 million and $988 million, respectively, related to the EID Specialty Products and EID ECP (i.e., ethylene copolymers business, excluding its ethylene acrylic elastomers business) Entities. The company expects 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million.For the Year Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions)202020192018Cash provided by (used for) financing activities$303 $(2,929)$(2,624)Cash provided by (used for) financing activities was $303 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $(2,929) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily due to lower payments on long-term debt, due to the 2019 debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (using a portion of the contributions from DowDuPont), lower net payment on borrowings (less than 90 days), the May 2020 Debt Offering, and the absence of distributions to DowDuPont (which in 2019 were used primarily to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s dividend payments). This was partially offset by dividends to Corteva stockholders, repurchases of Corteva common stock and payments 65Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019 there was a transfer of cash to DowDuPont as part of the Internal Reorganizations.Cash used for financing activities was $(2,929) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $(2,624) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was due to repayments of commercial paper and long-term debt and transfers of cash to DowDuPont in connection with the Internal Reorganization and Business Realignments in 2019, partially offset by a net increase in contributions from Dow and DowDuPont, primarily for repayment of long-term debt, and a decrease in distributions to Dow and DowDuPont which were used to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s dividend payments, and in 2018 to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s share repurchases.During 2020, the company's Board of Directors authorized and paid four quarterly dividends on its common stock of $0.13 per share each.On June 26, 2019, the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date. The company repurchased $300 million under its share buyback plan since the Corteva Distribution and expects to repurchase the remaining $700 million in 2021. During 2019, the company purchased and retired 824,000 shares for a total cost of $25 million. During 2020, the company purchased and retired 8,503,000 shares for a total cost of $275 million. See Note 19 - Stockholders' Equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the share buyback plan.EID Liquidity DiscussionAs discussed in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements, EID is a subsidiary of Corteva, Inc. and continues to be a reporting company, subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Cash used for financing activitiesEID’s cash provided by (used for) financing activities was $381 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $(2,855) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was due to lower payments on long-term debt due to the 2019 debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID's existing debt liabilities (using a portion of the contributions from DowDuPont and proceeds from related party debt), lower net payment on borrowings (less than 90 days), the May 2020 Debt Offering, and the absence of distributions to DowDuPont (which in 2019 were used primarily to fund a portion of DowDuPont's dividend payments). This activity was partially offset by lower proceeds from related party debt and higher payments on related party debt, and payments for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. In addition, during 2019 there was a transfer of cash to DowDuPont as part of the Internal Reorganizations. EID’s cash used for financing activities was $(2,855) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $(2,624) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was due to repayments of commercial paper and long-term debt, transfers of cash to DowDuPont in connection with the Internal Reorganization and Business Realignments in 2019, and a net decrease in contributions from Dow and DuPont, primarily for repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by proceeds received from the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc., and a decrease in distributions to Dow and DowDuPont which were used to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s dividend payments, and in 2018 to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s share repurchases. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Pension Plans and Other Post Employment BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and OPEB plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive.Substantially all of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and OPEB are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S., the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. The company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For non-U.S. benefit plans, historically the company utilized prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. 67Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining the 2020 net periodic pension cost in the U.S., 6.25 percent of long-term expected return on plan assets assumption was used. After re-evaluating the current strategic asset allocation and recent market conditions, the company lowered the long-term expected return on plan assets assumption to 5.75 percent to be used in determining 2021 net periodic pension cost in the U.S. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets. In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months, however, as a result of the Merger, the market-related value of assets was calculated by averaging market returns from September 1, 2017 through the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)December 31, 2020December 31, 2019December 31, 2018Market-related value of assets$16.3 $16.4 $16.6 Fair value of plan assets 17.5 16.6 15.7 For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets. The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and OPEB plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/4 PercentagePointIncrease1/4 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$(12)$14 Expected rate of return on plan assets40 (40)Additional information with respect to pension and OPEB expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 73 and in Note 20 - Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.68Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Environmental MattersAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2020, the company had accrued obligations of $329 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $52 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (""PRPs"") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to $620 million above that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 3 - Recent Accounting Guidance, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Indemnification Assets The company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by DuPont, Dow, and Chemours. The term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of DuPont, Dow, and / or Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to indemnifications.Income Taxes The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and 69Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.At December 31, 2020, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $429 million, inclusive of a valuation allowance of $453 million. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.Valuation of Assets and Impairment ConsiderationsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environment in which the company's segments operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.The company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. The company’s reporting units include seed, crop protection and digital. For purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment 70Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.If additional quantitative testing is required, the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge, if any, is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The company determines fair values for each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach), utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs, or the market approach.Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The company’s significant assumptions in these analyses include future cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the tax rate. The company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and planned business strategy and includes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on its most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts. The company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzes published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in the company’s valuations ranged from 9.5% to 15.5%. Under the market approach, the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions for comparable companies.Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Based on the goodwill impairment analyses performed in the fourth quarter 2020, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 20 percent, and no goodwill impairment charge was necessary.Prepaid RoyaltiesThe company’s seed segment currently has certain third-party biotechnology trait license agreements, which require up-front and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions. These payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license. The rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio, market dynamics, farmer preferences, growth rates and projected planted acres. Changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans, including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology, could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty. At December 31, 2020, the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was $426 million and $459 million, respectively. The majority of the balance of prepaid royalties relates to the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.’s (“Pioneer”) non-exclusive license in the United States and Canada for the Monsanto Company's Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® glyphosate tolerance trait and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans (“Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement”). The prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of up-front, fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in Pioneer’s soybean product mix. The company’s historical expectation has been that the technology licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the Pioneer® brand soybean through the term of the agreement. DAS and MS Technologies, L.L.C. jointly developed and own the Enlist E3TM herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2, 4-D choline in Enlist Duo® and Enlist One® herbicides, as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides. In connection with the validation of breeding plans and large-scale product development timelines, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company accelerated the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands, including Pioneer® brands, over the subsequent five years. During the ramp-up period, the company is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement (the “Transition Plan”). The rate of royalty expense is therefore expected to significantly increase through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty as fewer seeds containing the respective trait are expected to be utilized.71Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In connection with the departure from these traits in the company's product portfolio, beginning January 1, 2020 the company presents and discloses the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a component of restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense represents the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the company recognized $159 million in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations from non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense. The expected non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense estimated for 2021 is approximately $184 million, aggregating to approximately $360 million over the next four years. Further changes in factors and assumptions associated with usage of the trait platform licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement, including the Transition Plan, could further impact the rate of recognition of the prepaid royalty and statement of operations presentation of the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense. 72Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not had to make significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.Contractual ObligationsInformation related to the company's significant contractual obligations is summarized in the following table: Payments Due In(Dollars in millions)Total atDecember 31, 202020212022-20232024-20252026 andbeyondOperating lease and finance lease obligations1$603 $153 $199 $114 $137 Expected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity158 20 40 40 58 Long-term debt11,110 1 — 500 609 Purchase obligations2 Information technology infrastructure & services52 32 20 — — Raw material obligations1,486 480 629 317 60 Other136 112 14 10 — Total purchase obligations1,674 624 663 327 60 Other liabilities1,3 Pension and other post employment benefits 5,434 264 584 920 3,666 Workers' compensation66 11 28 12 15 Environmental remediation329 100 80 73 76 License agreements4481 169 245 45 22 Other5287 113 54 31 89 Total other long-term liabilities6,597 657 991 1,081 3,868 Total contractual obligations6,7$10,142 $1,455 $1,893 $2,062 $4,732 1.Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2.Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement.3.The company's contractual obligations do not reflect an offset for recoveries associated with indemnifications by Chemours, Dow, and DuPont in accordance with the Chemours Separation Agreement and the Separation Agreement (related to the Corteva Distribution), respectively. Refer to Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail related to the indemnifications.4.Represents undiscounted remaining payments under Pioneer license agreements ($464 million on a discounted basis). 5.Primarily represents employee-related benefits other than pensions and other post employment benefits and asset retirement obligations.6.Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. 7.The timing and amount of escrow funding requirements under the MOU cannot be estimated, as a result of the cost sharing arrangement with DuPont, and have been excluded from the table. See Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Long-term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other post employment benefits or OPEB plans). Substantially all of the company's worldwide benefit 73Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans on November 30, 2018. Therefore, as of November 30, 2018, active employees participating in the U.S. pension plans will not accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received. In addition to the changes to the U.S. pension plans, OPEB eligible employees who will be under the age of 50 as of November 30, 2018 will not receive post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.In December 2020, the company amended its retiree medical, dental and life insurance plans. Effective January 1, 2022, the company will no longer provide retiree dental and life insurance benefits. In addition, Corteva’s portion of the cost of non-Medicare retiree medical coverage will no longer be adjusted for cost increases, resulting in Corteva’s cost to be capped at the level in effect as of December 31, 2021. As a result of these changes, the company recorded a $(939) million decrease in OPEB benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 with a corresponding prior service benefit within other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020.Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company did not make contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2020. Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $9 million, $39 million, and $103 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $53 million, $82 million and $111 million to its unfunded plans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $207 million, $202 million, and $216 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles. In 2021, the company expects to contribute approximately $47 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan. The company expects to contribute approximately $217 million to its OPEB plans in 2021, and expects the amount to decrease to approximately $140 million in 2022 as a result of the OPEB plan amendment. The company is evaluating potential discretionary contributions in 2021 to the principal U.S. pension plan, that could reduce a portion of the underfunded benefit obligation. Any discretionary contributions depend on various factors including market conditions and tax deductible limits. 74Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:For the Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions)202020192018Net periodic benefit (credit) cost - pension and OPEB$(340)$(163)$(186)Defined contributions127 115 117 Long-term employee benefit plan (credit) charges - continuing operations$(213)$(48)$(69)The above (credit) charges for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. Long-term employee credits were $(213) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $(48) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change is due to lower discount rates. See ""Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 67 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.For 2021, long-term employee benefits credit is expected to increase by about $930 million. The increase is mainly due to amendments to the OPEB plans and a decrease in the discount rates, partly offset by a change in expected return on plan assets from 6.25 percent to 5.75 percent.Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below: For the Year Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions)202020192018Environmental operating costs$138 $136 $142 Environmental remediation costs163 29 48 $201 $165 $190 1.Environmental remediation costs include costs that are subject to the $200 million thresholds and sharing arrangements as discussed in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Corteva Separation Agreement.About 85 percent of total pre-tax environmental operating costs charged to income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental operating costs charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. 75Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Remediation Accrual Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2018$398 Remediation payments(49)Net increase in remediation accrual 129 Net change, indemnification 2(42)Balance at December 31, 2019$336 Remediation payments(57)Net increase in remediation accrual 163 Net change, indemnification 2(13)Balance at December 31, 2020$329 1.Excludes indemnified remediation obligations.2.Represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from EID's accrued remediation liabilities of obligations that have been fully transferred to Chemours and DuPont. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and subsequent MOU, and the Corteva Separation Agreement, as discussed in Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, EID is indemnified by Chemours and DuPont for certain environmental matters.Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $620 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2020. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. The above noted $329 million accrued obligations includes the following:As of December 31, 2020(In millions)Indemnification AssetAccrual balance3,4Potential exposure above amount accrued3Environmental Remediation Stray LiabilitiesChemours related obligations - subject to indemnity1,2$153 $154 $282 Other discontinued or divested businesses obligations1— 74 222 Environmental remediation liabilities primarily related to DuPont - subject to indemnity from DuPont237 36 61 Environmental remediation liabilities not subject to indemnity— 65 55 Total$190 $329 $620 1.Represents liabilities that are subject to the $200 million thresholds and sharing arrangements as discussed on page F-51, under Corteva Separation Agreement.2.The company has recorded an indemnification asset related to these accruals, including $30 million related to the Superfund sites.3.Accrual balance represents management’s best estimate of the costs of remediation and restoration, although it is reasonably possible that the potential exposure, as indicated, could range above the amounts accrued, as there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates.4.Accrual balance excludes indemnification liabilities of $39 million to Chemours, related to the cost sharing arrangement under the MOU (see page F-27).As of December 31, 2020, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (""Superfund"") or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 130 sites for which the company does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at 70 of the 500 sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 210 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose 76Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at 2 new sites during 2018. There were no new notices in 2019 or 2020.Environmental Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were approximately $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $11 million in 2021.Climate ChangeThe company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities. The Board of Directors maintains oversight of these risks and opportunities. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues. Across its business, individuals who are responsible for climate-related initiatives may have annual performance goals tied to the delivery of projects related to these initiatives. Continuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and market-based approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Extreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on customers’ ability to use the company's products, potentially reducing sales volumes, revenues and margins. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture and mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather. The company integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its overall risk management.The company completed a non-financial materiality assessment and identified short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities. The results of this assessment are integrated into the company's businesses, strategy and financial planning and are presented in the 14 ten-year sustainability goals that were set in 2020. For each goal, the company established key performance indicators and criteria to achieve the goals, which are provided on the company's website at: https://www.corteva.com/sustainability.html. The information contained on the company’s website is not part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the company’s other SEC filings.As demonstrated by the goals, Corteva is working to shrink its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses while enabling a more resilient agriculture value chain. Corteva will establish a climate strategy, including appropriate Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas reduction targets, by June 2021. The company is seeking ways to reduce its impact and providing tools and incentives for customers to do the same. Corteva champions climate positive agriculture, utilizing carbon storage and other means to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits without sacrificing farmer productivity or ongoing profitability. The company is committed to engaging with multiple stakeholders and partners around the globe who have innovative and actionable ideas to help safeguard the health and well-being of the planet and its people. By doing more to address climate change today, the company is fortifying its ability to grow food, grow progress and build a sustainable industry that will help humanity thrive for generations to come.77Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts may be used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks The company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the Brazilian Real, Swiss franc, European Euro (""EUR""), and Canadian dollar. The company uses foreign exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company's exposure to certain forecasted transactions, investment in foreign subsidiaries, as well as the translation of foreign currency-denominated earnings and uses commodity contracts to offset risks associated with foreign currency devaluation in certain countries. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar (""USD"") amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Certain foreign entities of the company held USD denominated marketable securities, mainly U.S. government securities, at December 31, 2020. The USD/EUR was the primary foreign exchange exposure for these nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities. These marketable securities were classified as available-for-sale and as such, fluctuations in foreign exchange were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) within the Consolidated Statements of Equity. These fluctuations are subsequently reclassified from AOCL to earnings in the period in which the marketable securities are sold.The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates.

These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service Corteva and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global product lines.78Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by region.79Part II",2023-12-30 21:51:38.793920

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of Operations Global Economic ConditionsOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared the novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) a pandemic. The global health crisis caused by COVID-19 and the related government actions and stay at home orders have negatively impacted economic activity and increased political instability across the globe. Since the crisis began, Corteva has engaged its global Integrated Health Services Pandemic & Infectious Disease Team to take actions and implement guidelines and protocols in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 becomes more contained, a rebound in economic activity has occurred, although varying regionally depending on government policies and regulations and the rate, pace, and effectiveness of the containment efforts deployed by various national, state, and local governments, vaccination rates, and the ability of COVD-19 variants to overcome containment efforts, available vaccines, and medical treatments. These varying levels of recovery have created a misalignment of supply and demand for labor, transportation and logistic services, energy, raw materials and other inputs, which have been exasperated in certain regions by one-time events, including extreme weather events. Corteva will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering its business operations that it determines are in the best interests of its stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. These alterations or modifications may impact the company's business, including the effects on its customers, employees, and prospects, or on its financial results through at least 2022. With the ongoing volatility in global markets, the company will continue to monitor various factors that could impact earnings and cash flows of the business, including, but not limited to the inflation of, or unavailability of raw material inputs and transportation and logistics services, currency fluctuations, expectations of future planted area (as influenced by consumer demand, ethanol markets and government policies and regulations), trade and purchasing of commodities globally and relative commodity prices.2021 Restructuring ActionsDuring the first quarter of 2021, Corteva approved restructuring actions designed to right-size and optimize footprint and organizational structure according to the business needs in each region with the focus on driving continued cost improvement and productivity. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the company recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $167 million, comprised of $74 million of severance and related benefit costs, $45 million of asset related charges, $6 million of asset retirement obligations and $42 million of costs related to contract terminations (contract terminations includes early lease terminations). The company does not anticipate any additional material charges from the 2021 Restructuring Activities as actions associated with this charge are substantially complete. Future cash payments related to this charge are anticipated to be approximately $70 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits, asset retirement obligations, and costs related to contract terminations.The 2021 Restructuring Actions are expected to contribute to the company’s ongoing cost and productivity improvement effortsthrough achieving an estimated $70 million of savings on a run rate basis by 2023. See Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.Share Buyback PlanOn August 5, 2021, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (""2021 Share Buyback Plan"").

The increase was primarily driven by increased volumes in both seed and crop protection, higher input costs, freight and logistics, which are primarily market-driven, and unfavorable currency, partially offset by ongoing cost and productivity actions. The market driven trends are expected to continue as global supply chains and logistics remain constrained across industries.2020 versus 2019COGS was $8,507 million (60 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8,575 million (62 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by currency benefits, lack of inventory step-up in 2020 as compared to $272 million recognized in 2019, and ongoing cost and productivity actions. The decrease was partially offset by increased volumes, higher input costs in both seed and crop protection and higher royalties in seed. Amortization of inventory step-up was 2 percent of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.COGS was $8,507 million (60 percent of net sales) on an as reported basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8,386 million (61 percent of net sales) on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The change was primarily driven by the items noted on page 42, under the header “Interest Expense – 2021 versus 2020,” and by lower interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 2020 versus 2019 EID’s interest expense was $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $242 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily driven by the items noted on page 42, under the header ""Interest Expense - 2020 versus 2019,"" and by lower interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes2021For the year ended December 31, 2021, EID had an effective tax rate of 22.2 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2,296 million, driven by the items noted on page 42, under the header “Provision for Income Taxes - 2021” and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.2020For the year ended December 31, 2020, EID had an effective tax rate of (18.3) percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $575 million, driven by the items noted on page 42, under the header “Provision for Income Taxes - 2020” and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 2019For the year ended December 31, 2019, EID had an effective tax rate of 16.8 percent on pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $(422) million, driven by the items noted on page 43, under the header ""Provision for Income Taxes - 2019"" and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on a related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Corporate Outlook - 2022Global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong with an expected record demand for grain and oilseeds. The company anticipates total U.S. corn and soybean planted area to be flat, with a modest shift towards soybeans.The company expects net sales to be in the range of $16.7 billion and $17.0 billion, driven by new product sales and continued focus on the company’s price for value strategy, partially offset by currency headwinds. The company expects Operating EBITDA to be in the range of $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion with new product sales, pricing and ongoing cost savings actions offsetting the expected increased input costs. Operating Earnings Per Share is expected to be in the range of $2.30 and $2.50 per share. Refer to further discussion of Non-GAAP metrics on pages 52 - 54.The above outlook does not contemplate any extreme weather events, operational disruptions, significant changes in customers' demand or ability to pay, or further acceleration of currency and inflation impacts resulting from global economic conditions. Corteva is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty items outside of the company’s control, such as Significant Items, without unreasonable effort (refer to page 53 for Significant Items recorded in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019). However, the company expects non-operating benefits to be approximately $1 billion lower, as a result of the 2020 OPEB Plan Amendments, an increase in the discount rates, and a change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Refer to the company's discussion on Long-term Employee Benefits on page 65. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2020, the company recognizes non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a restructuring and asset related charge. For further discussion of accelerated prepaid royalty amortization refer to the Company's Critical Accounting Estimates for Prepaid Royalties on page 63.44Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial InformationThe supplemental unaudited pro forma statements of operations (the ""unaudited pro forma statements of operations"") for Corteva for the year ended December 31, 2019 gives effect to the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016. For the periods presented below, Corteva’s results for all periods prior to the Business Realignment and Internal Reorganization consist of the combined results of operations for Historical EID and DAS, and Corteva’s results for all periods after the Business Realignment and Internal Reorganization represent the consolidated balances of the company. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations below were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X that was in effect prior to recent amendments, and events that are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results (e.g., amortization of inventory step-up costs) are excluded. One-time transaction-related costs incurred prior to, or concurrent with, the closing of the Merger, the debt redemptions/repayments, and the Corteva Distribution are not included in the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations through March 31, 2019. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations do not reflect restructuring or integration activities or other costs, that were not already reflected in GAAP results, following the separation and distribution transactions that may be incurred to achieve cost or growth synergies of Corteva. As no assurance can be made that these costs will be incurred or the growth synergies will be achieved, no adjustment has been made.The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what Corteva’s results of operations actually would have been had the above transactions been completed on January 1, 2016. In addition, the unaudited pro forma statements of operations do not purport to project the future operating results of the company. The unaudited pro forma statements of operations were based on and should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 45Part IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 3 - Recent Accounting Guidance, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. Segment Reviews The company operates in two reportable segments: seed and crop protection. The company’s seed segment is a global leader in developing and supplying advanced germplasm and traits that produce optimum yield for farms around the world. The segment offers trait technologies that improve resistance to weather, disease, insects and herbicides used to control weeds, and trait technologies that enhance food and nutritional characteristics, and also provides digital solutions that assist farmer decision-making with a view to optimize product selection and, ultimately, help maximize yield and profitability. The segment competes in a wide variety of agricultural markets. The crop protection segment serves the global agricultural input industry with products that protect against weeds, insects and other pests, and disease, and that improve overall crop health both above and below ground via nitrogen management and seed-applied technologies. The segment is a leader in global herbicides, insecticides, nitrogen stabilizers and pasture and range management herbicides.Summarized below are comments on individual segment net sales and segment operating EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, segment operating EBITDA is calculated on a pro forma basis, as this is the manner in which the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") assesses performance and allocates resources. Pro forma adjustments used in the calculation of pro forma segment operating EBITDA were determined in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X that was in effect prior to recent amendments. For the year ended December 31, 2019, these adjustments give effect to the Merger, the debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (as discussed in Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and the separation and distribution to DowDuPont stockholders of all the outstanding shares of Corteva common stock as if they had been consummated on January 1, 2016 (refer to supplemental unaudited pro forma financial statements on page 45). The company defines segment operating EBITDA as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, corporate expenses, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB benefit (costs), tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy EID businesses and sites, and the 2021 officer indemnification payment. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. See Note 25 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (costs) excluded from segment operating EBITDA. All references to prices are based on local price unless otherwise specified.A reconciliation of segment operating EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations after income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is included in Note 25 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 47Part IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued SeedSeed net sales were $8,402 million in 2021, up 8 percent from $7,756 million in 2020. The increase was driven by a 4 percent increase in price and a 4 percent increase in volume. Local price gains were driven by strong adoption of new Seed technology, including price execution in Latin America and EMEA, with corn price up 5 percent globally. These gains were partially offset by competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans, where price was down 2 percent. The increase in volume was driven by strong demand for corn in Brazil, coupled with higher soybean and corn sales in North America.Seed operating EBITDA was $1,512 million in 2021, up 25 percent from $1,208 million in 2020. Continued price execution, volume gains, ongoing cost and productivity actions, lower royalties, and lower bad debt expense more than offset higher input costs, higher freight and warehousing costs, and higher variable compensation costs. Seed net sales were $7,756 million in 2020, up 2 percent from $7,590 million in 2019. The increase was driven by a 5 percent increase in volume and 1 percent increase in price, partially offset by a 4 percent unfavorable impact from currency. Volume growth was driven by the recovery of soybean planted area in North America and strong summer and Safrinha sales in Brazil. Global corn price grew 2 percent year over year, primarily driven by continued penetration from products such as Qrome® and PowerCore ULTRATM. North America soybean price increased 2 percent versus the year-ago period due to superior product performance and strong execution. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real. Seed operating EBITDA was $1,208 million in 2020, up 16 percent from pro forma operating EBITDA of $1,040 million in 2019. Favorable mix, volume gains and ongoing cost and productivity actions more than offset the unfavorable impact of currency, higher input costs and higher royalties.49Part IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Crop Protection Crop protection net sales were $7,253 million in 2021, up 12 percent from $6,461 million in 2020. The increase was due to a 6 percent increase in volume, a 5 percent increase in price and a 2 percent favorable impact from currency, partially offset by a 1 percent unfavorable portfolio impact. Volume gains were led by continued penetration of new products globally, with combined sales of over $1.4 billion in 2021, up nearly $450 million compared to the prior-year period, led by EnlistTM and ArylexTM herbicides and IsoclastTM insecticide. These volume gains were partially offset by an approximate $275 million impact from the company's decision to phase out select low-margin products. The increase in price was primarily driven by gains in North America and Latin America, including pricing for higher raw material and logistical costs. Favorable currency impacts were primarily from the Euro. The portfolio impact was driven by a divestiture in Asia Pacific.Crop protection operating EBITDA was $1,202 million in 2021, up 20 percent from $1,004 million from 2020. Pricing execution, continued penetration of new products, ongoing cost and productivity actions, and a favorable impact from currency more than offset higher input costs, including raw material and logistical costs, and higher variable compensation costs. Crop protection net sales were $6,461 million in 2020, up from $6,256 million in 2019. Sales gains were driven by a 7 percent increase in volume and a 4 percent increase in price, which was partially offset by a 7 percent impact from currency and a 1 percent impact from portfolio. The increase in volume was driven by continued penetration of new products globally, with combined sales of $1 billion in 2020, up $265 million compared to the prior-year period, led by EnlistTM, ArylexTM, and RinskorTM herbicides and IsoclastTM insecticide. Local price growth was driven by increases in Latin America to offset currency, coupled with favorable mix globally from new product launches. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Brazilian Real. The Company has recognized approximately $150 million in pricing to offset the weakening Brazilian Real for the full year. The portfolio impact was driven by divestitures in Asia Pacific and North America.Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $1,004 million in 2020, down from pro forma segment operating EBITDA of $1,066 million in 2019. Favorable mix, ongoing cost and productivity actions, together with volume gains, were more than offset by the negative impact of currency, increased investment to fund growth and higher input costs. Currency net of pricing was a $70 million headwind, inclusive of $150 million in pricing actions. 51Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe company presents certain financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include Operating EBITDA and operating earnings (loss) per share. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and a more useful comparison of year over year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the company's U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP are provided below. For the year ended December 31, 2019, information is on a pro forma basis and these non-GAAP measures are being reconciled to a pro forma GAAP financial measure prepared and presented in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X that was in effect prior to recent amendments, which are reconciled to the GAAP reported figures. See Article 11 Pro Forma Combined Statements of Operations on page 46.Operating EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Effective January 1, 2021, on a prospective basis, the company excludes from segment operating EBITDA net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB benefits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy EID businesses and sites, and the 2021 officer indemnification payment. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. Operating earnings (loss) per share is defined as ""earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations - diluted"" excluding the after-tax impact of significant items, the after-tax impact of non-operating benefits (costs), the after-tax impact of amortization expense associated with intangible assets existing as of the Separation from DowDuPont, and the after-tax impact of net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Although amortization of the company's intangible assets is excluded from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in amortization of additional intangible assets. Net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting represents the non-cash net gain (loss) from changes in fair value of certain undesignated foreign currency derivative contracts. Upon settlement, which is within the same calendar year of execution of the contract, the realized gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the non-qualified foreign currency derivative contracts will be reported in the relevant non-GAAP financial measures, allowing quarterly results to reflect the economic effects of the foreign currency derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.52Part IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company's credit ratings impact its access to the debt capital markets and cost of capital. The company remains committed to a strong financial position and strong investment-grade rating. The company's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned to EID are as follows: Long-termShort-termOutlookStandard & Poor's1A-A-2StableMoody’s Investors ServiceA3P-2StableFitch Ratings1AF1Stable1.In addition, Corteva, Inc. has been assigned a long-term issuer credit rating of A- with Stable outlook by Standard & Poor's and an Issuer Default Rating of A with Stable outlook by Fitch Ratings. The company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund its operations, including seasonal working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases and pension obligations. Corteva's strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings will provide access as needed to capital markets and commercial paper markets to fund seasonal working capital needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing and committed receivable repurchase facilities. Corteva considers the borrowing costs and lending terms when selecting the source to fund its operations and working capital needs.The company had access to approximately $6.4 billion in committed and uncommitted unused credit lines at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These facilities provide support to meet the company’s short-term liquidity needs and for general corporate purposes which may include funding of discretionary and non-discretionary contributions to certain benefit plans, severance payments, repayment and refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases and redemptions of securities and funding Corteva's costs and expenses. On January 22, 2021, Chemours, DuPont, Corteva and EID entered into a binding memorandum of understanding containing a settlement to resolve legal disputes originating from the Delaware Litigation and Pending Arbitration, and to establish a cost sharing arrangement and escrow account to be used to support and manage potential future legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) liabilities arising out of pre-July 1, 2015 conduct (the “MOU”). The MOU replaces the 2017 amendment to the Chemours Separation Agreement. According to the terms of the cost sharing arrangement within the MOU, Corteva and DuPont together, on one hand, and Chemours, on the other hand, agreed to a 50-50 split of certain qualified expenses related to PFAS liabilities incurred over a term not to exceed twenty years or $4 billion of qualified spend and escrow account contributions in the aggregate. DuPont’s and Corteva’s 50% share under the MOU will be limited to $2 billion, including qualified expenses and escrow contributions (see below for discussion of escrow contributions). These expenses and escrow account contributions will be subject to the existing Letter Agreement, under which DuPont and Corteva will each bear 50% of the first $300 million (up to $150 million each), and thereafter DuPont bears 71% and Corteva bears the remaining 29%. In order to support and manage any potential future PFAS liabilities, the parties have also agreed to establish an escrow account. The MOU provides that (1) no later than each of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2022, Chemours shall deposit $100 million into an escrow account and DuPont and Corteva shall together deposit $100 million in the aggregate into an escrow account and (2) no later than September 30 of each subsequent year through and including 2028, Chemours shall deposit $50 million into an escrow account and DuPont and Corteva shall together deposit $50 million in the aggregate into an escrow account. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the MOU, each party may be permitted to defer funding in any year (excluding 2021). Over this period, Chemours will deposit a total of $500 million in the account and DuPont and Corteva will deposit an additional $500 million pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement. Additionally, if on December 31, 2028, the balance of the escrow account (including interest) is less than $700 million, Chemours will make 50% of the deposits and DuPont and Corteva together will make 50% of the deposits necessary to restore the balance of the escrow account to $700 million. Such payments will be made in a series of consecutive annual equal installments commencing on September 30, 2029 pursuant to the escrow account replenishment terms as set forth in the MOU. During 2021, the company contributed is initial deposit into the MOU Escrow Account, which is classified as noncurrent restricted cash equivalents and is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the MOU and Letter Agreement.55Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued In November 2018, EID entered into a $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion three-year revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facilities”). The 2018 Revolving Credit Facilities became effective May 2019. Corteva, Inc. became a party at the time of the Corteva Distribution. In May 2021, the company entered into an amendment that extended the maturity date of the 3-year revolving credit facility from May 2022 to May 2023. Other than the change in maturity date, there were no material modifications to the terms of the credit facility. The Revolving Credit Facilities may serve as a substitute to the company's commercial paper program, and can be used, from time to time, for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, the funding of seasonal working capital needs. The Revolving Credit Facilities contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. The Revolving Credit Facilities also contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At December 31, 2021 the company was in compliance with these covenants.In March 2020, the company drew down $500 million under the three-year revolving credit facility to finance its short term liquidity needs as a result of the volatility and increased borrowing costs of commercial paper resulting from the unstable market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and repaid that borrowing in full in June 2020. In May 2020, EID issued $500 million of 1.70 percent Senior Notes due 2025 and $500 million of 2.30 percent Senior Notes due 2030 (the May 2020 Debt Offering). The proceeds of this offering are intended to be used for general corporate purposes.The company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations affecting manufacturing plants, mineral producing properties or research facilities located in the U.S. and the consolidated subsidiaries owning such plants, properties and facilities subject to certain limitations. The outstanding long-term debt also contains customary default provisions.The company has meaningful seasonal working capital needs based in part on providing financing to its customers. Working capital is funded through multiple methods including cash, commercial paper, a receivable repurchase facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities, and factoring. In February 2021, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $1 billion (the ""2021 Repurchase Facility"") which expired in December 2021. Under the 2021 Repurchase Facility, Corteva sold a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables to participating institutions and simultaneously agreed to repurchase at a future date.In February 2022, the company entered into a new committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $500 million (the ""2022 Repurchase Facility"") which expires in December 2022. See further discussion of the 2022 Repurchase Facility in Note 26 - Subsequent Events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The company has factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell its trade receivables under both recourse and non-recourse agreements in exchange for cash proceeds in an effort to reduce its receivables risk. For arrangements that include an element of recourse, the company provides a guarantee of the trade receivables in the event of customer default. Refer to Note 12 - Accounts and Notes Receivable - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.The company also organizes agreements with third-party financial institutions who directly provide financing for select customers of its seed and crop protection products in each region. Terms of the third-party loans are less than a year and programs are renewed on an annual basis. In some cases, the company guarantees a portion of the extension of such credit to such customers. Refer to Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information on the company’s guarantees.Capacity ExpansionDuring 2021, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $113 million increase in the capital investment (approximately $260 million in total) for the previously announced expansion of Spinosyns fermentation capacity. The 30 percent increase in capacity is staged to come online over the next several years. Higher capital investment is primarily due to updated design requirements impacting materials, labor and engineering costs.56Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Debt Redemptions/RepaymentsOn March 22, 2019, EID issued notices of redemption in full of all of its outstanding notes (the “Make Whole Notes”) listed in the table below:(in millions)Amount4.625% Notes due 2020$474 3.625% Notes due 20212964.250% Notes due 20211632.800% Notes due 20233816.500% Debentures due 2028575.600% Senior Notes due 2036424.900% Notes due 2041484.150% Notes due 204369Total$1,530 The Make Whole Notes were redeemed on April 22, 2019 at the make-whole redemption prices set forth in the respective Make Whole Notes. On and after the date of redemption, the Make Whole Notes were no longer deemed outstanding, interest on the Make Whole Notes ceased to accrue and all rights of the holders of the Make Whole Notes were terminated. For further information on the Make Whole Notes, see Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In March 2016, EID entered into a credit agreement that provides for a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $4.5 billion (as amended, from time to time, the ""Term Loan Facility"") under which EID could make up to seven term loan borrowings and amounts repaid or prepaid were not available for subsequent borrowings. On May 2, 2019, EID terminated its Term Loan Facility and repaid the aggregate outstanding principal amount of $3 billion plus accrued and unpaid interest through and including May 1, 2019. For further information on the termination of the Term Loan Facility, see Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In connection with the repayment of the Make Whole Notes and the Term Loan Facility, EID paid a total of $4.6 billion in the second quarter 2019, which included breakage fees and accrued and unpaid interest on the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility. The repayment of the Make Whole Notes and Term Loan Facility was funded with cash from operations and a contribution from DowDuPont. On May 7, 2019, DowDuPont publicly announced the record date in connection with the Corteva Distribution. In connection with such announcement, EID was required to redeem $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.200% Notes due 2020 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (collectively, the Special Mandatory Redemption or “SMR Notes”) setting forth the date of redemption of the SMR Notes. The date of redemption was May 17, 2019 and EID paid a total of $2.0 billion, which included accrued and unpaid interest on the SMR Notes. The company funded the payment with a contribution from DowDuPont. Following the redemption, the SMR Notes are no longer outstanding and no longer bear interest and all rights of the holders of the SMR Notes have terminated.The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, of which $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. Upon actual repatriation, such earnings could be subject to withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes, and taxes resulting from the impact of foreign currency movements. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. At December 31, 2021, management believed that sufficient liquidity is available in the U.S. with global operating cash flows, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities, and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets.57Part IIITEM 7.

The increase in cash provided by (used for) operating activities was driven by an increase in net income, and improvement in working capital primarily driven by higher customer prepayments and higher accounts payable.Cash provided by (used for) operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,064 million compared to $1,070 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by (used for) operating activities was driven by an increase in net income, including a decrease in integration and separation costs, and improvement in working capital, partially offset by the absence of the net impact of cash earnings from EID ECP and EID Specialty Products entities, as a result of the Internal Reorganizations and Business Realignments in 2019.For the Year Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions)202120202019Cash provided by (used for) investing activities$(362)$(674)$(904)Cash provided by (used for) investing activities was $(362) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $(674) million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The change was primarily due to lower capital expenditures driven by the Internal Reorganizations and Business Realignments in 2019, partially offset by higher net purchases of investments and lower proceeds from sales of property, businesses, and consolidated companies. Capital expenditures totaled $573 million, $475 million, and $1,163 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes capital expenditures of $497 million, related to the EID Specialty Products and EID ECP (i.e., ethylene copolymers business, excluding its ethylene acrylic elastomers business) Entities. The company expects 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $645 million.For the Year Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions)202120202019Cash provided by (used for) financing activities$(1,266)$303 $(2,929)Cash provided by (used for) financing activities was $(1,266) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $303 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily due to lower borrowings and higher repurchases of Corteva common stock. Cash provided by (used for) financing activities was $303 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $(2,929) million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily due to lower payments on long-term debt, due to the 2019 debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID’s existing debt liabilities (using a portion of the contributions from DowDuPont), lower net payment on borrowings (less than 90 days), the May 2020 Debt Offering, and the absence of distributions to DowDuPont (which in 2019 were used primarily to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s dividend payments). This was partially offset by dividends to Corteva stockholders, repurchases of Corteva common stock and payments for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019 there was a transfer of cash to DowDuPont as part of the Internal Reorganizations.58Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued During 2021, the company's Board of Directors authorized and paid quarterly dividends on its common stock of $0.13, $0.13, $0.14, and $0.14 in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. On August 5, 2021, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (“2021 Share Buyback Plan”). In connection with the 2021 Share Buyback Plan, the company repurchased and retired 5,572,000 shares during the year ended December 31, 2021 in the open market for a total cost of $250 million.On June 26, 2019, the company's Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (""2019 Share BuyBack Plan""). The company completed the 2019 Share Buyback Plan during the third quarter of 2021. In connection with the 2019 Share Buyback Plan, the company repurchased and retired 15,378,000 shares, 8,503,000 shares, and 824,000 shares during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, in the open market for a total cost of $700 million, $275 million, and $25 million, respectively.

The change was due to lower payments on long-term debt due to the 2019 debt retirement transactions related to paying off or retiring portions of EID's existing debt liabilities (using a portion of the contributions from DowDuPont and proceeds from related party debt), lower net payment on borrowings (less than 90 days), the May 2020 Debt Offering, and the absence of distributions to DowDuPont (which in 2019 were used primarily to fund a portion of DowDuPont's dividend payments). This activity was partially offset by lower proceeds from related party debt and higher payments on related party debt, and payments for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests. In addition, during 2019 there was a transfer of cash to DowDuPont as part of the Internal Reorganizations. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 59Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Pension Plans and Other Post Employment BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and OPEB plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive.Substantially all of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and OPEB are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S., the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. The company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For non-U.S. benefit plans, historically the company utilized prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date. The weighted average discount rates used in developing the 2022 net periodic pension and OPEB costs are expected to be 2.82 percent and 2.59 percent, respectively. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining the 2021 net periodic pension cost in the U.S., 5.75 percent of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was used. After re-evaluating the current strategic asset allocation and recent market conditions, the company lowered the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption to 4.50 percent to be used in determining the 2022 net periodic pension cost in the U.S. Consistent with prior years, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets. In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months, however, as a result of the Merger, the market-related value of assets was calculated by averaging market returns from September 1, 2017 through the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)December 31, 2021December 31, 2020December 31, 2019Market-related value of assets$17.2 $16.3 $16.4 Fair value of plan assets 17.5 17.5 16.6 For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets. 60Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and OPEB plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021:Pre-tax Earnings Benefit (Charge)(Dollars in millions)1/4 PercentagePointIncrease1/4 PercentagePointDecreaseDiscount rate$(33)$36 Expected rate of return on plan assets42 (42)Additional information with respect to pension and OPEB expenses, liabilities and assumptions is discussed under ""Long-term Employee Benefits"" beginning on page 65 and in Note 20 - Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental MattersAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2021, the company had accrued obligations of $452 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $68 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (""PRPs"") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to $592 million above that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third-party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Indemnification Assets The company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by DuPont, Dow, and Chemours. The term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of DuPont, Dow, and / or Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the 61Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information related to indemnifications.Income Taxes The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.At December 31, 2021, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $782 million, inclusive of a valuation allowance of $366 million. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.Valuation of Assets and Impairment ConsiderationsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environment in which the company's segments operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.The company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. 62Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. The company’s reporting units include seed, crop protection and digital. For purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.If additional quantitative testing is required, the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge, if any, is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill associated with the reporting unit. The company determines fair values for each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach), utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs, or the market approach.Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The company’s significant assumptions in these analyses include future cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the tax rate. The company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and planned business strategy and includes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on its most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts. The company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzes published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in the company’s valuations ranged from 9.25 percent to 16.5 percent. Under the market approach, the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions for comparable companies.Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Based on the goodwill impairment analyses performed in the fourth quarter 2021, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 20 percent, and no goodwill impairment charge was necessary.Prepaid RoyaltiesThe company’s seed segment currently has certain third-party biotechnology trait license agreements, which require up-front and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions. These payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license. The rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio, market dynamics, farmer preferences, growth rates and projected planted acres. Changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans, including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology, could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty. At December 31, 2021, the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was $303 million and $256 million, respectively. The majority of the balance of prepaid royalties relates to the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.’s (“Pioneer”) non-exclusive license in the United States and Canada for the Monsanto Company's Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® glyphosate tolerance trait and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans (“Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement”). The prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of up-front, fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in Pioneer’s soybean product mix. The company’s historical expectation has been that the technology licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the Pioneer® brand soybean through the term of the agreement. DAS and MS Technologies, 63Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued L.L.C. jointly developed and own the Enlist E3TM herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2, 4-D choline in Enlist Duo® and Enlist One® herbicides, as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides. In connection with the validation of breeding plans and large-scale product development timelines, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company accelerated the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands, including Pioneer® brands, over the subsequent five years. During the ramp-up period, the company is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement (the “Transition Plan”). The rate of royalty expense is therefore expected to significantly increase through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty as fewer seeds containing the respective trait are expected to be utilized.In connection with the departure from these traits in the company's product portfolio, beginning January 1, 2020 the company presents and discloses the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a component of restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense represents the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the company recognized $125 million in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations from non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense. The expected non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense estimated for 2022 is approximately $102 million, aggregating to approximately $235 million over the next 3 years. Further changes in factors and assumptions associated with usage of the trait platform licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement, including the Transition Plan, could further impact the rate of recognition of the prepaid royalty and statement of operations presentation of the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not made significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of long-term debt, operating and finance lease obligations and environmental remediation obligations. Refer to further discussion on long-term debt and operating and finance lease obligations in Note 17 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities and Note 16 – Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. Refer to discussion on environmental remediation obligations on page 68 of this report.

Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.64Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Long-term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (""other post employment benefits"" or ""OPEB""). Substantially all of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans on November 30, 2018, resulting in the participants no longer accruing additional benefits. In addition to the changes to the U.S. pension plans, OPEB eligible employees who were under the age of 50 as of November 30, 2018 will not receive post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.In September 2021, the company transferred approximately $250 million of certain benefit obligations and related assets associated with the principal U.S. pension plan to an insurance company through the purchase of nonparticipating group annuity contracts. The company may consider additional annuity purchases in the future.In December 2020, the company amended its retiree medical, dental and life insurance plans resulting in the company no longer providing retiree dental and life insurance benefits effective January 1, 2022 and Corteva’s portion of the cost of non-Medicare retiree medical coverage no longer being adjusted for cost increases, which capped the Corteva cost at the level as of December 31, 2021 (""2020 OPEB Plan Amendments""). As a result of these changes, the company recorded a $(939) million decrease in OPEB benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 with a corresponding prior service benefit within other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2021, a substantial amount of the prior service benefit within other comprehensive income (loss) in 2020 was recognized in other income - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company did not make contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $8 million, $9 million, and $39 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $41 million, $53 million, and $82 million to its unfunded plans for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $198 million, $207 million, and $202 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net 65Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued impact of per capita health care cost, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.In 2022, the company expects to contribute approximately $60 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan and approximately $140 million to its OPEB plans. The company does not anticipate making contributions to its principal U.S. pension plan in 2022. The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:For the Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions)202120202019Net periodic benefit (credit) cost - pension and OPEB$(1,292)$(340)$(163)Defined contributions1125 127 115 Long-term employee benefit plan (credit) charges - continuing operations$(1,167)$(213)$(48)1.The year ended December 31, 2021 includes a charge of $33 million for the company contributions to be paid in 2022, which was included in accrued and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.The above (credit) charges for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. Long-term employee benefit plan credits were $(1,167) million and $(213) million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change is due to the 2020 OPEB Plan Amendments and lower discount rates. See ""Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 60 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.For 2022, long-term employee benefits credit is expected to decrease by about $1 billion. The decrease is mainly due to the 2020 OPEB Plan Amendments, an increase in the discount rates, and a change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets from 5.75 percent to 4.50 percent.Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below: For the Year Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions)202120202019Environmental operating costs$144 $138 $136 Environmental remediation costs146 63 29 $190 $201 $165 1.Environmental remediation costs include costs that are subject to the $200 million threshold and sharing arrangements as discussed in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under the header Corteva Separation Agreement.Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including 66Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. About 85 percent of total pre-tax environmental operating costs charged to income (loss) from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental operating costs charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. Remediation Accrual Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2019$336 Remediation payments(57)Net increase in remediation accrual 163 Net change, indemnification 2(13)Balance at December 31, 2020$329 Remediation payments(35)Net increase in remediation accrual 146 Net change, indemnification 2112 Balance at December 31, 2021$452 1.Excludes indemnified remediation obligations.2.Represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from EID's accrued remediation liabilities of obligations that have been fully transferred to Chemours and DuPont. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and subsequent MOU, and the Corteva Separation Agreement, as discussed in Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, EID is indemnified by Chemours and DuPont for certain environmental matters.Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $592 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2021. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. 67Part IIITEM 7.

Accrual balance includes $68 million for remediation of Superfund sites. Amounts do not include possible impacts from the remediation elements of the EPAs October 2021 PFAS Strategic Roadmap (as applicable) or possible revisions to Chemours’ Consent Order with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, as any possible impacts, to the extent such items would be reimbursable under the MOU, are not yet determinable.4.Represents liabilities that are subject to the $150 million threshold and sharing agreements as discussed in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under the header ""Chemours/ Performance Chemicals."" 5.Included accrued obligations of $133 million due in the next twelve months with the remainder being due subsequent to 2022.As of December 31, 2021, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (""Superfund"") or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 130 sites for which the company does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 70 of the 500 sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 210 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. There were no new notices in 2021 or 2020. Environmental Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were approximately $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $9 million in 2022.Climate Change The company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities. The Board of Directors maintains oversight of these risks and opportunities. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues. Across its business, individuals who are responsible for climate-related initiatives may have annual performance goals tied to the delivery of projects related to these initiatives. Continuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and market-based approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Extreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on our customers’ ability to use the company's products, potentially reducing sales volumes, revenues and margins. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for 68Part IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture and mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather. The company integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its overall risk management.The company completed a non-financial materiality assessment and identified short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities. The results of this assessment are integrated into the company's businesses, strategy and financial planning and are presented in the 14 ten-year sustainability goals that were set in 2020. For each goal, the company established key performance indicators and criteria to achieve the goals, which are provided on the company's website at: https://www.corteva.com/sustainability.html. The information contained on the company’s website is not part of, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the company’s other SEC filings.As demonstrated by the goals, Corteva is working to shrink its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses while enabling a more resilient agriculture value chain. Corteva has an established climate strategy, including appropriate Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas reduction targets. The company is seeking ways to reduce its impact and providing tools and incentives for customers to do the same. Corteva champions climate positive agriculture, utilizing carbon storage and other means to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits without sacrificing farmer productivity or ongoing profitability. The company is committed to engaging with multiple stakeholders and partners around the globe who have innovative and actionable ideas to help safeguard the health and well-being of the planet and its people. By doing more to address climate change today, the company is fortifying its ability to grow food, grow progress and build a sustainable industry that will help humanity thrive for generations to come.69Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts may be used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks The company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the Brazilian Real, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and European Euro (""EUR""). The company uses foreign exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company's exposure to certain forecasted transactions, investment in foreign subsidiaries, as well as the translation of foreign currency-denominated earnings and uses commodity contracts to offset risks associated with foreign currency devaluation in certain countries. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 22 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company will enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar (""USD"") amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. Certain foreign entities of the company held USD denominated marketable securities, mainly U.S. government securities, at December 31, 2020. The USD/EUR was the primary foreign exchange exposure for these nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities. These debt securities were classified as available-for-sale marketable securities and as such, fluctuations in foreign exchange were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the Consolidated Statements of Equity. These fluctuations were subsequently reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings during 2021, which was the period in which the marketable securities were sold. At December 31, 2021, the company no longer held these USD denominated marketable securities. The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates.

These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service Corteva and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global product lines.70Part IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, continuedThe company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Analysis of Operations Global Economic ConditionsEconomic activity continues to be impacted by ongoing factors driving volatility in global markets including the misalignment of supply and demand for labor, transportation and logistic services, energy, raw materials and other inputs, the inflation of (or unavailability of) raw material inputs and transportation and logistics services, currency fluctuations, military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and resulting economic sanctions, extreme weather and the evolution of the novel coronavirus disease (""COVID-19""). Corteva will continue to actively monitor global conditions and may take further actions altering its business operations that it determines are in the best interests of its stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. These alterations or modifications may impact the company's business, including the effects on its customers, employees, and prospects, or on its financial results for the foreseeable future. The ongoing factors driving volatility in global markets that could impact our business' earnings and cash flows include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed above, expectations of future planted area (as influenced by consumer demand, ethanol markets and government policies and regulations), trade and purchasing of commodities globally and relative commodity prices.In response to Russia’s military conflict with Ukraine, in April 2022 the company announced its decision to withdraw from Russia and stop production and business activities (""Russia Exit""). Prior to these decisions, Russia contributed approximately 2 percent of the company's annual net sales. Refer to the 2022 Restructuring Actions discussion below for additional information.2022 Restructuring ActionsIn connection with the company’s shift to a global business unit model, the company assessed its business priorities and operational structure to maximize the customer experience and deliver on growth and earnings potential. As a result of this assessment, the company has committed to restructuring actions that, combined with the impact of the company’s Russia Exit (collectively the “2022 Restructuring Actions”), is expected to result in total net pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $350 million to $420 million, comprised of $105 million to $120 million of severance and related benefit costs, $125 million to $150 million of asset related charges, $65 million to $80 million of costs related to contract terminations (including early lease terminations) and $55 million to $70 million of other charges.Cash payments related to these charges are anticipated to be $180 million to $210 million, of which approximately $90 million has been paid through December 31, 2022, and primarily relate to the payment of severance and related benefits, contract terminations and other charges. The restructuring actions associated with these charges are expected to be substantially complete in 2023.The total pre-tax restructuring and other charges included $48 million associated with the Russia Exit for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Russia Exit net pre-tax charges consisted of $6 million of severance and related benefit costs, $6 million of asset related charges, and $26 million of costs related to contract terminations (including early lease terminations). Other pre-tax charges associated with the Russia Exit were recorded to cost of goods sold and other income (expense) – net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, relating to inventory write-offs of $2 million and settlement costs of $8 million, respectively. Additional pre-tax charges up to $20 million associated with the Russia Exit are possible, primarily associated with the collectibility of government receivables. The company also recorded a pre-tax benefit of $3 million relating to the sale of seeds already under production in Russia when the decision to exit the country was made and that the company was contractually required to purchase, which consisted of $8 million of net sales and $5 million of cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statement of Operations (“Russian Seed Sale”). The 2022 Restructuring Actions are expected to contribute to the company’s ongoing cost and productivity improvement efforts through achieving an estimated $210 million to $220 million of savings on a run rate basis by 2025. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Share Buyback PlanOn September 13, 2022, Corteva, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program to purchase Corteva, Inc.'s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, without an expiration date (""2022 Share Buyback Plan"").

The increase was primarily driven by a 10 percent increase in price and a 5 percent increase in volume versus the prior year period, partially offset by a (3) percent unfavorable currency impact and (1) percent unfavorable portfolio impact. Price gains were driven by the continued execution on the company's price for value strategy with strong execution across all regions in response to cost inflation, and recovery of higher input costs. The increase in volume was driven by continued penetration of new products and gains in all regions, partially offset by reduced corn acres in North America and supply constraints in North America canola. The unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Turkish Lira and the Euro, partially offset by the Brazilian Real. The portfolio impact was driven by a divestiture in Asia Pacific.2021 versus 2020Net sales were $15,655 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $14,217 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Volume increased 5 percent versus the year-ago period with increases in all regions, led by Latin America. The volume increases were primarily driven by strong demand, the continued penetration of new and differentiated products and increased planted area. Price increased 4 percent versus prior year, driven by a continued focus on the company's price for value strategy and pricing for higher raw material and logistical costs.

The increase was primarily driven by increased volumes in crop protection, and higher input costs, freight and logistics, which are primarily market-driven. The increases are partially offset by ongoing cost and productivity actions and a favorable impact from currency. The market driven trends are expected to continue as global supply chains and logistics remain constrained across industries, with the potential for inflationary pressures easing in late 2023 on a year-over-year basis. 2021 versus 2020COGS was $9,220 million (59 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $8,507 million (60 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The decrease was primarily driven by favorable currency, lower functional spend and enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") costs, and the favorable impact relating to deferred compensation plans due to market declines, partially offset by an increase in commissions expense, selling expense, travel and consulting fees. 2021 versus 2020SG&A was $3,209 million (20 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $3,043 million (21 percent of net sales) for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The decrease was primarily driven by the expiration of the favorable supply contracts on November 1, 2022, at which point the contracts became fully amortized. See Note 12 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information for the above items. 2021 versus 2020Intangible asset amortization was $722 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $682 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The below relates to EIDP only and is presented to provide an Analysis of Operations, only for the differences between EIDP and Corteva, Inc.Interest Expense2022 versus 2021EIDP’s interest expense was $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change was primarily driven by the items noted on page 38, under the header “Interest Expense – 2022 versus 2021,” partially offset by lower interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EIDP and Corteva, Inc. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EIDP Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 39Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued 2021 versus 2020EIDP’s interest expense was $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily driven by the items noted on page 38, under the header “Interest Expense – 2021 versus 2020,” and by lower interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EIDP and Corteva, Inc. See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EIDP Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes2022For the year ended December 31, 2022, EIDP had an effective tax rate of 14.4 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1,381 million, driven by the items noted on page 38, under the header “Provision for Income Taxes - 2022 and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EIDP and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EIDP Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.2021For the year ended December 31, 2021, EIDP had an effective tax rate of 22.2 percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2,296 million, driven by the items noted on page 39, under the header “Provision for Income Taxes - 2021” and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EIDP and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EIDP Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.2020For the year ended December 31, 2020, EIDP had an effective tax rate of (18.3) percent on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $575 million, driven by the items noted on page 39, under the header “Provision for Income Taxes - 2020” and a tax benefit related to the interest expense incurred on the related party loan between EIDP and Corteva, Inc. See Note 3 - Income Taxes, to the EIDP Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Corporate Outlook - 2023The outlook for agriculture remains robust in 2023, with record demand for grain and oilseeds as ending stocks continue to be under pressure. Commodity prices are above historical averages, and farmer balance sheets and income levels remain healthy, leading farmers to prioritize technology to maximize return. The company expects an increase in U.S. planted area and continues to monitor dynamic weather conditions around the world.The company expects net sales to be in the range of $18.1 billion and $18.4 billion. Operating EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion. Operating Earnings Per Share is expected to be in the range of $2.70 and $2.90 per share, which reflects higher earnings and lower average share count, partially offset by forecasted higher effective tax rate and interest expense. Refer to further discussion of Non-GAAP metrics on pages 45 - 47.The above outlook does not contemplate any extreme weather events, operational disruptions, significant changes in customers' demand or ability to pay, further acceleration of currency and inflation impacts resulting from global economic conditions or the impact of the previously announced Biologicals acquisitions that are expected to close in the first half of 2023. Corteva is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty items outside of the company’s control, such as Significant Items, without unreasonable effort (refer to page 46 for Significant Items recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020). However, during 2022 the company committed to restructuring activities relating to the 2022 Restructuring Actions, which are expected to be completed in 2023. The total net pre-tax restructuring and other charges are not expected to be material to the company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 5 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. The company also expects non-operating charges associated with pension and OPEB costs to increase when compared to 2022, which is mainly due to an increase in discount rates and a decrease in asset returns due to lower pension plan assets. Refer to the company's discussion on Long-Term Employee Benefits on page 57. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2020, the company recognizes non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a restructuring and asset related charge. For further discussion of accelerated prepaid royalty amortization refer to the Company's Critical Accounting Estimates for Prepaid Royalties on page 55. 40Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 3 - Recent Accounting Guidance, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements. Segment Reviews The company operates in two reportable segments: seed and crop protection. The company’s seed segment is a global leader in developing and supplying advanced germplasm and traits that produce optimum yield for farms around the world. The segment offers trait technologies that improve resistance to weather, disease, insects and enhance food and nutritional characteristics, herbicides used to control weeds, and digital solutions that assist farmer decision-making with a view to optimize product selection and, ultimately, help maximize yield and profitability. The segment competes in a wide variety of agricultural markets. The crop protection segment serves the global agricultural input industry with products that protect against weeds, insects and other pests, and disease, and that improve overall crop health both above and below ground via nitrogen management and seed-applied technologies. The segment offers crop protection solutions and digital solutions that provide farmers the tools they need to improve productivity and profitability, and help keep fields free of weeds, insects and diseases. The segment is a leader in global herbicides, insecticides, nitrogen stabilizers and pasture and range management herbicides.Summarized below are comments on individual segment net sales and segment operating EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The company defines segment operating EBITDA as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, corporate expenses, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB credits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy EIDP businesses and sites, and the 2021 officer indemnification payment. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. See Note 22 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details related to significant pre-tax benefits (costs) excluded from segment operating EBITDA. All references to prices are based on local price unless otherwise specified.A reconciliation of segment operating EBITDA to income (loss) from continuing operations after income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is included in Note 22 - Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 41Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued SeedSeed net sales were $8,979 million in 2022, up 7 percent from $8,402 million in 2021. The sales increase was driven by a 9 percent increase in price, partially offset by a 2 percent unfavorable currency impact.The increase in price was driven by strong execution globally, led by North America and Latin America, with global corn and soybean prices up 9 percent and 11 percent, respectively. Volume gains in Latin America corn and North America soybeans were offset by reduced corn acres in North America and supply constraints in North America canola. Enlist E3TM soybean market penetration reached over 45 percent of total North American acres. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Turkish Lira and the Euro, partially offset by the Brazilian Real.Seed operating EBITDA was $1,656 million in 2022, up 10 percent from $1,512 million in 2021. Price execution and ongoing cost and productivity actions more than offset higher input and freight costs, the unfavorable impact of currency, lower volumes in North America, and increased investment in R&D. Segment operating EBITDA margin improved by approximately 45 basis points versus the prior-year period.Seed net sales were $8,402 million in 2021, up 8 percent from $7,756 million in 2020. The increase was driven by a 4 percent increase in price and a 4 percent increase in volume. Local price gains were driven by strong adoption of new Seed technology, including price execution in Latin America and EMEA, with corn price up 5 percent globally. These gains were partially offset by competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans, where price was down 2 percent. The increase in volume was driven by strong demand for corn in Brazil, coupled with higher soybean and corn sales in North America.Seed operating EBITDA was $1,512 million in 2021, up 25 percent from $1,208 million in 2020. Continued price execution, volume gains, ongoing cost and productivity actions, lower royalties, and lower bad debt expense more than offset higher input costs, higher freight and warehousing costs, and higher variable compensation costs.Crop ProtectionFor the Year Ended December 31, In millions202220212020Net sales$8,476 $7,253 $6,461 Segment operating EBITDA$1,684 $1,202 $1,004 Crop Protection2022 vs. 2021Percent Change Due To:Net Sales ChangePrice &Portfolio /In millions$%Product MixVolumeCurrencyOtherNorth America$584 23 %14 %10 %(1)%— %EMEA123 8 %7 %15 %(14)%— %Latin America562 26 %14 %10 %2 %— %Asia Pacific(46)(4)%5 %(1)%(5)%(3)%Total$1,223 17 %11 %9 %(3)%— %Crop Protection2022 vs. 2021Percent Change Due To:Net Sales ChangePrice &Portfolio /In millions$%Product MixVolumeCurrencyOtherHerbicides$776 20 %15 %8 %(3)%— %Insecticides101 6 %7 %3 %(4)%— %Fungicides140 11 %6 %10 %(3)%(2)%Other206 52 %7 %47 %(2)%— %Total$1,223 17 %11 %9 %(3)%— % 43Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7.

The increase was driven by an 11 percent increase in price and a 9 percent increase in volumes. These gains were partially offset by a 3 percent unfavorable currency impact.The increase in price, led by North America and Latin America, reflected pricing for higher raw material and logistical costs and the value of our differentiated technology. The increase in volume was driven by continued penetration of new products, including EnlistTM and ArylexTM herbicides and IsoclastTM insecticide, with new product sales up 33 percent compared to the same period last year. Unfavorable currency impacts were led by the Euro and the Turkish Lira, partially offset by the Brazilian Real. Segment Operating EBITDA was $1,684 million in 2022, up 40 percent from $1,202 million from 2021. Pricing and volume gains and productivity actions more than offset higher input costs, including raw material costs, and the unfavorable impact of currency. Segment operating EBITDA margin improved by approximately 330 basis points versus the prior-year period largely driven by pricing execution and new and differentiated technology.Crop protection net sales were $7,253 million in 2021, up 12 percent from $6,461 million in 2020. The increase was due to a 6 percent increase in volume, a 5 percent increase in price and a 2 percent favorable impact from currency, partially offset by a 1 percent unfavorable portfolio impact. Volume gains were led by continued penetration of new products globally, with combined sales of over $1.4 billion in 2021, up nearly $450 million compared to the prior-year period, led by EnlistTM and ArylexTM herbicides and IsoclastTM insecticide. These volume gains were partially offset by an approximate $275 million impact from the company's decision to phase out select low-margin products. The increase in price was primarily driven by gains in North America and Latin America, including pricing for higher raw material and logistical costs. Favorable currency impacts were primarily from the Euro. The portfolio impact was driven by a divestiture in Asia Pacific.Crop protection operating EBITDA was $1,202 million in 2021, up 20 percent from $1,004 million from 2020. Pricing execution, continued penetration of new products, ongoing cost and productivity actions, and a favorable impact from currency more than offset higher input costs, including raw material and logistical costs, and higher variable compensation costs. 44Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe company presents certain financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP and are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures include Operating EBITDA and operating earnings (loss) per share. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the company during the periods presented and provide more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and a more useful comparison of year over year results. These non-GAAP measures supplement the company's U.S. GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Furthermore, such non-GAAP measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP are provided below.Operating EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) (i.e., income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating benefits (costs), foreign exchange gains (losses), and net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, excluding the impact of significant items. Effective January 1, 2021, on a prospective basis, the company excludes from segment operating EBITDA net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and OPEB credits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy businesses and sites, and the 2021 officer indemnification payment. Tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, between Corteva and Dow and/or DuPont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. Operating earnings (loss) per share is defined as ""earnings (loss) per common share from continuing operations - diluted"" excluding the after-tax impact of significant items, the after-tax impact of non-operating benefits (costs), the after-tax impact of amortization expense associated with intangible assets existing as of the Separation from DowDuPont, and the after-tax impact of net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Although amortization of the company's intangible assets is excluded from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in amortization of additional intangible assets. Net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting represents the non-cash net gain (loss) from changes in fair value of certain undesignated foreign currency derivative contracts. Upon settlement, which is within the same calendar year of execution of the contract, the realized gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the non-qualified foreign currency derivative contracts will be reported in the relevant non-GAAP financial measures, allowing quarterly results to reflect the economic effects of the foreign currency derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility. 45Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7.

The tax only significant item benefit for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a net benefit for the impact of changes in valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax asset positions of two legal entities in Brazil of $(57) million and $44 million, as well as an adjustment related to the impacts of Swiss Tax Reform of $4 million. The tax only significant item benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects the impacts of the recognition of an elective cantonal component of the recent enactment of the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (""Swiss Tax Reform"") ($(182) million benefit) and a benefit due to an elective change in accounting method that alters the 2019 impact of the Separation on foreign tax provisions ($(29) million benefit), 46Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued The company believes its ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund its operations, including seasonal working capital, capital spending, dividend payments, share repurchases and pension obligations. Corteva's strong financial position, liquidity and credit ratings will provide access as needed to capital markets and commercial paper markets to fund seasonal working capital needs. The company's liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, commercial paper, syndicated credit lines, bilateral credit lines, long-term debt markets, bank financing and committed receivable repurchase facilities. Corteva considers the borrowing costs and lending terms when selecting the source to fund its operations and working capital needs.The company had access to approximately $6.0 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in committed and uncommitted unused credit lines, which includes the uncommitted revolving credit lines relating to the Foreign Currency Loans. These facilities provide support to meet the company’s short-term liquidity needs and for general corporate purposes, which may include funding of discretionary and non-discretionary contributions to certain benefit plans, severance payments, repayment and refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases and redemptions of securities, funding of acquisitions and funding Corteva's costs and expenses. In November 2018, EIDP entered into a $3 billion, 5-year revolving credit facility and a $3 billion, 3-year revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facilities”). The 2018 Revolving Credit Facilities became effective May 2019. Corteva, Inc. became a party at the time of the Corteva Distribution. In May 2021, the company entered into an amendment that extended the maturity date of the 3-year revolving credit facility from May 2022 to May 2023. Other than the change in maturity date, there were no material modifications to the terms of the credit facility. During May 2022, the Revolving Credit Facilities were refinanced for purposes of extending the maturity dates to 2027 and 2025 for the 5-year and 3-year revolving credit facilities, respectively, lowering the facility amount of the 3-year revolving credit facility to $2 billion and transitioning the interest rate to Adjusted Term SOFR, which is Term SOFR plus 0.10 percent, plus the applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facilities may serve as a substitute to the company's commercial paper program, and can be used, from time to time, for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, the funding of seasonal working capital needs. The Revolving Credit Facilities contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facilities contain a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At December 31, 2022, the company was in compliance with these covenants.In May 2020, EIDP issued $500 million of 1.70 percent Senior Notes due 2025 and $500 million of 2.30 percent Senior Notes due 2030 (the May 2020 Debt Offering). The proceeds of this offering are used for general corporate purposes.In May 2022, the company entered into a $500 million, 364-day revolving credit agreement (the “364-Day Revolving Credit Facility”) expiring in May 2023. Borrowings under the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility will have an interest rate equal to Adjusted Term SOFR, which is Term SOFR plus 0.10 percent, plus the applicable margin. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility includes a provision under which the company may convert any advances outstanding prior to the maturity date into term loans having a maturity date up to one year later. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility will be used for general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, the funding of seasonal working capital needs. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are typical for companies with similar credit ratings. Additionally, the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant requiring that the ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization for Corteva and its consolidated subsidiaries not exceed 0.60. At December 31, 2022, the company was in compliance with these covenants. In January 2023, the company amended and restated the 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility agreement to increase the facility amount to $1 billion and extend the expiration date from May 2023 to January 2024.The company enters into short-term and long-term foreign currency loans from time-to-time by accessing uncommitted revolving credit lines to fund working capital needs of foreign subsidiaries in the normal course of business (“Foreign Currency Loans”). Interest rates are variable and determined at the time of borrowing. Total unused bank credit lines on the Foreign Currency Loans at December 31, 2022 was approximately $75 million. The company’s long-term Foreign Currency Loans have varying maturities through 2024.The company's indenture covenants include customary limitations on liens, sale and leaseback transactions, and mergers and consolidations affecting manufacturing plants, mineral producing properties or research facilities located in the U.S. and the 48Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued consolidated subsidiaries owning such plants, properties and facilities subject to certain limitations. The outstanding long-term debt also contains customary default provisions.The company has meaningful seasonal working capital needs based in part on providing financing to its customers. Working capital is funded through multiple methods including cash, commercial paper, a receivable repurchase facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities, the 364-day Revolving Credit Facility, and factoring. In February 2022, the company entered into a committed receivable repurchase facility of up to $500 million (the ""2022 Repurchase Facility"") which expired in December 2022. Under the 2022 Repurchase Facility, Corteva sold a portfolio of available and eligible outstanding customer notes receivables to participating institutions and simultaneously agreed to repurchase at a future date.The company has factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell its trade receivables under both recourse and non-recourse agreements in exchange for cash proceeds in an effort to reduce its receivables risk. For arrangements that include an element of recourse, the company provides a guarantee of the trade receivables in the event of customer default. Refer to Note 9 - Accounts and Notes Receivable - Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.The company also organizes agreements with third-party financial institutions who directly provide financing for select customers of its seed and crop protection products in each region. Terms of the third-party loans are less than a year and programs are renewed on an annual basis. In some cases, the company guarantees a portion of the extension of such credit to such customers. Refer to Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information on the company’s guarantees.The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are $3.3 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, of which $2.0 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. Upon actual repatriation, such earnings could be subject to withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes, and taxes resulting from the impact of foreign currency movements. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. At December 31, 2022, management believed that sufficient liquidity is available in the U.S. with global operating cash flows, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities, and access to capital markets and commercial paper markets.Capacity ExpansionDuring 2022, the company's previously announced expansion of Spinosyns fermentation capacity was completed. Production began upon completion of the expansion and is on track to achieve the expected 30 percent increase in capacity over the next several years.

See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EIDP Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the related party loan between EIDP and Corteva, Inc.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Pension Plans and Other Post Employment BenefitsAccounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and OPEB plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted 51Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive.Substantially all of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and OPEB are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S., the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. The company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The company primarily utilizes prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date for non-U.S. benefit plans. The weighted average discount rates used in developing the 2023 net periodic pension and OPEB costs are expected to be 5.17 percent and 5.09 percent, respectively. Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. In determining the 2022 net periodic pension cost in the U.S., an assumption of 4.5 percent for expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was used. After re-evaluating the current strategic asset allocation and recent market conditions, the company kept the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at 4.5 percent to be used in determining the 2023 net periodic pension cost in the U.S. Consistent with prior years, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets.In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months.The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:(Dollars in billions)December 31, 2022December 31, 2021December 31, 2020Market-related value of assets$13.6 $17.2 $16.3 Fair value of plan assets 12.3 17.5 17.5 For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets.

At December 31, 2022, the company had accrued obligations of $512 million for probable 52Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $61 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (""PRPs"") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately $600 million above the accrued obligations amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see ""Environmental Matters"" section on page 58 and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ContingenciesThe company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third-party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Indemnification Assets The company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by DuPont, Dow, and Chemours. The term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk. Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of DuPont, Dow, and/or Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information related to indemnifications.Income Taxes The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made. 53Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material. See Note 7 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.At December 31, 2022, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $640 million, inclusive of a valuation allowance of $342 million. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 7 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.Valuation of Assets and Impairment ConsiderationsThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, EBITDA margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environment in which the company's segments operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.The company tests goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually (during the fourth quarter), or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative and / or quantitative testing procedures. The company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. The company’s reporting units included seed, crop protection and digital until its April 2022 implementation of a global business unit organization model (“BU Reorganization”), after which its reporting units are seed and crop protection. The BU Reorganization resulted in the company’s digital reporting unit being merged into the seed and crop protection reporting units with the goodwill relating to the former digital reporting unit being reassigned to the seed and crop protection reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the company level include GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw 54Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.If additional quantitative testing is required, the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge, if any, is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill associated with the reporting unit. The company determines fair values for each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach), utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs, or the market approach.Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The company’s significant assumptions in these analyses include future cash flow projections, weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate and the tax rate. The company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and assumed business strategy from a market participant perspective and includes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on such strategy. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts. The company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzes published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts. Under the market approach, the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions for comparable companies.As a result of the BU Reorganization, the company determined that a triggering event had occurred during the second quarter of 2022 that required an interim impairment assessment as of April 1, 2022. The interim impairment assessment was performed on the seed, crop protection, and the former digital reporting units immediately prior to the BU Reorganization and for the seed and crop protection reporting units immediately after the BU Reorganization resulting in no goodwill impairment charges. Qualitative interim impairment assessments were performed for the seed and crop protection reporting units as of April 1, 2022. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and therefore a quantitative test was not performed.A quantitative impairment assessment was performed for the former digital reporting unit as of April 1, 2022 using a combination of the discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach) and the market approach. The discount rate used in the company’s valuation was 19.0 percent. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Based on the quantitative annual goodwill impairment analyses performed in the fourth quarter 2022, which were performed using the income approach, the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 50.0 percent, and no goodwill impairment charge was necessary. The discount rate used in the company’s valuations was 11.0 percent.Prepaid RoyaltiesThe company’s seed segment currently has certain third-party biotechnology trait license agreements, which require up-front and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions. These payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license. The rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio, market dynamics, farmer preferences, growth rates and projected planted acres. Changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans, including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology, could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty. At December 31, 2022, the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was $224 million and $101 million, respectively. The majority of the balance of prepaid royalties relates to the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.’s (“Pioneer”) non-exclusive license in the United States and Canada for the Monsanto 55Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Company's Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® glyphosate tolerance trait and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans (“Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement”). The prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of up-front, fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in Pioneer’s soybean product mix. The company’s historical expectation was that the technology licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the Pioneer® brand soybean through the term of the agreement. DAS and MS Technologies, L.L.C. jointly developed and own the Enlist E3TM herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2, 4-D choline in Enlist Duo® and Enlist One® herbicides, as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides. In connection with the validation of breeding plans and large-scale product development timelines, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company committed to accelerate the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands, including Pioneer® brands, over the subsequent five years. During the ramp-up period, the company has begun to significantly reduce the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement (the “Transition Plan”). As of December 31, 2022, Enlist E3TM trait platform has grown to approximately 50 percent of our soybean portfolio. Royalty expense has therefore significantly increased through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty.In connection with the departure from these traits in the company's product portfolio, beginning January 1, 2020 the company presents and discloses the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a component of restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense represents the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the company recognized $109 million in restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations from non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense. The expected non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense estimated for 2023 is approximately $75 million, aggregating to approximately $130 million over the subsequent two years. Further changes in factors and assumptions associated with usage of the trait platform licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement, including the Transition Plan, could further impact the rate of recognition of the prepaid royalty and Consolidated Statement of Operations presentation of the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain Guarantee ContractsInformation with respect to the company's guarantees is included in Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the company has not made significant payments to satisfy guarantee obligations; however, the company believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these guarantees.MOU Escrow ContributionsOn January 22, 2021, Chemours, DuPont, Corteva and EIDP entered into a binding memorandum of understanding containing a settlement to resolve legal disputes originating from the Delaware Litigation and Pending Arbitration, and to establish a cost sharing arrangement for potential future legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) liabilities arising out of pre-July 1, 2015 conduct (the “MOU”). Under the terms of the MOU, Corteva’s estimated aggregate share of the potential $2 billion is approximately $600 million. In order to support and manage any potential future PFAS liabilities, the parties have also agreed to establish an escrow account (""MOU Escrow Account""). The MOU provides that contributions to the MOU Escrow Account will be made by Chemours, DuPont and Corteva, annually over an eight-year period through 2028. Over this period, Chemours will deposit a total of $500 million in the account and DuPont and Corteva, together, will deposit an additional $500 million pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement. Additionally, if on December 31, 2028, the balance of the MOU Escrow Account (including interest) is less than $700 million, Chemours will make 50% of the deposits and DuPont and Corteva, together, will make 50% of the deposits necessary to restore the balance of the escrow account to $700 million pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement.The company made its annual installment deposits due to the MOU Escrow Account through December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further details on the MOU and funding of the MOU Escrow Account. 56Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued Contractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist of long-term debt, operating and finance lease obligations and environmental remediation obligations. Refer to further Note 14 - Long-Term Debt and Available Credit Facilities, Note 13 – Leases, and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively, for further discussion.Information related to the company's other significant contractual obligations are summarized in the following table: Payments Due In(Dollars in millions)Total atDecember 31, 202220232024 andbeyondExpected cumulative cash requirements for interest payments through maturity$237 $52 $185 Purchase obligations12,023 789 1,234 License agreements2, 3168 123 45 Other liabilities2, 4275 26 249 Total 5$2,703 $990 $1,713 1.Represents enforceable and legally binding agreements in excess of $1 million to purchase goods or services that specify fixed or minimum quantities; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the agreement.2.Included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Represents undiscounted remaining payments under Pioneer license agreements (approximately $150 million on a discounted basis).4. Includes liabilities related to employee-related benefits other than pension and other post employment benefits, asset retirement obligations and other noncurrent liabilities.5. Due to uncertainty regarding the completion of tax audits and possible outcomes, the timing of certain payments of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 7 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Long-Term Employee Benefits The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (""other post employment benefits"" or ""OPEB""). Substantially all of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans. Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans, and on November 30, 2018, the company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans, resulting in the participants no longer accruing additional benefits. In addition to the changes to the U.S. pension plans, OPEB eligible employees who were under the age of 50 as of November 30, 2018 will not receive post employment medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post employment medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.In December 2020, the company amended its retiree medical, dental and life insurance plans resulting in the company no longer providing retiree dental and life insurance benefits effective January 1, 2022 and Corteva’s portion of the cost of non-Medicare retiree medical coverage no longer being adjusted for cost increases, which capped the Corteva cost at the level as of December 31, 2021 (""2020 OPEB Plan Amendments""). As a result of these changes, the company recorded a $939 million decrease in OPEB benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 with a corresponding prior service benefit within other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2021, a substantial amount of the prior service benefit within other 57Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued comprehensive income (loss) in 2020 was recognized in other income (expense) - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company did not make contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $6 million, $8 million, and $9 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $53 million, $41 million, and $53 million to its unfunded plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $122 million, $198 million, and $207 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of per capita health care cost, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.In 2023, the company expects to contribute approximately $50 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan and approximately $135 million to its OPEB plans. The company does not anticipate making contributions to its principal U.S. pension plan in 2023.The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:For the Year Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions)202220212020Net periodic benefit (credit) cost - pension and OPEB$(142)$(1,292)$(340)Defined contributions133 125 127 Long-term employee benefit plan (credit) charges - continuing operations$(9)$(1,167)$(213)The above (credit) charges for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. Long-term employee benefit plan credits were $(9) million and $(1,167) million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change is due to the 2020 OPEB Plan amendments. See ""Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits"" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 51 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.For 2023, long-term employee benefit costs are expected to increase by about $300 million. The change is mainly due to an increase in discount rates and a decrease in asset returns due to lower pension plan assets.Environmental MattersThe company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and 58Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below: For the Year Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions)202220212020Environmental operating costs$154 $144 $138 Environmental remediation costs184 46 63 $238 $190 $201 1.Environmental remediation costs include costs that are subject to the $200 million threshold and sharing arrangements as discussed in Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under the header Corteva Separation Agreement.Environmental Operating Costs As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials. About 85 percent of total pre-tax environmental operating costs charged to income (loss) from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental operating costs charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly. Remediation Accrual Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:(Dollars in millions) Balance at December 31, 2020$329 Remediation payments(35)Net increase in remediation accrual 146 Net change, indemnification 2112 Balance at December 31, 2021$452 Remediation payments(49)Net increase in remediation accrual 184 Net change, indemnification 225 Balance at December 31, 20223$512 1.Excludes indemnified remediation obligations.2.Represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from EIDP's accrued remediation liabilities of obligations that have been fully transferred to Chemours and DuPont. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and subsequent MOU, and the Corteva Separation Agreement, as discussed in Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, EIDP is indemnified by Chemours and DuPont for certain environmental matters.3.Includes accrued obligations of $137 million due in the next twelve months with the remainder being due subsequent to 2023.Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to approximately $600 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2022. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Refer to Note 15 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further details on the company’s accrued obligations at December 31, 2022. 59Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued As of December 31, 2022, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (""Superfund"") or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 120 sites for which the company does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 60 of the about 500 sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at about 210 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in ""de minimis buyouts"" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. There were no new notices in 2022 or 2021. Environmental Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were approximately $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $10 million in 2023.Climate Change The company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities, of which the Sustainability and Innovation Committee of the Board of Directors maintains oversight. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues. Across its business, individuals who are responsible for climate-related initiatives may have annual performance goals tied to the delivery of projects related to these initiatives. Continuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and market-based approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Extreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on our customers’ ability to use the company's products and seed supply, potentially reducing sales volumes, revenues and margins. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture and mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather. The company integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its enterprise risk management program.The company completed a non-financial materiality assessment and identified short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities. The results of this assessment are integrated into the company's businesses, strategy and financial planning. Corteva has an established climate strategy, including commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The company is seeking ways to reduce its impact and providing tools and incentives for customers to do the same. Corteva champions climate positive agriculture, utilizing carbon storage and other means to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits without sacrificing farmer productivity or ongoing profitability.While Corteva is working to reduce its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses it also invests in enabling innovation that can create a more resilient agriculture value chain. The company engages with multiple stakeholders and partners around the globe regarding our innovations and actionable ideas to help safeguard the health and well-being of the planet and its people. 60Table Of ContentsPart IIITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe company’s global operations are exposed to financial market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. The company has established a variety of programs including the use of derivative instruments and other financial instruments to manage the exposure to financial market risks as to minimize volatility of financial results. In the ordinary course of business, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and commodity price risks under established procedures and controls. For additional information on these derivatives and related exposures, see Note 19 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Decisions regarding whether or not to hedge a given commitment are made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the amount and duration of the exposure, market volatility and economic trends. Foreign currency exchange contracts may be used, from time to time, to manage near-term foreign currency cash requirements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks The company has significant international operations resulting in a large number of currency transactions that result from international sales, purchases, investments and borrowings. The primary currencies for which the company has an exchange rate exposure are the Brazilian Real, European Euro (""EUR""), Swiss franc, and Canadian dollar. The company uses foreign exchange contracts to offset its net exposures, by currency, related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of its operations. The company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts to offset a portion of the company's exposure to certain forecasted transactions, investment in foreign subsidiaries, as well as the translation of foreign currency-denominated earnings and uses commodity contracts to offset risks associated with foreign currency devaluation in certain countries. In addition to the contracts disclosed in Note 19 - Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, from time to time, the company may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to establish with certainty the U.S. dollar (""USD"") amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency. The following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The sensitivities for foreign currency contracts are based on a 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates. Fair Value(Liability)/AssetFair ValueSensitivity(Dollars in millions)2022202120222021Foreign currency contracts$25 $44 $(208)$(211)The potential gain/loss in value for each risk management portfolio described above would be offset in part by changes in the value of the underlying exposure.Concentration of Credit Risk The company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are generally highly rated and geographically dispersed and the company has a policy to limit the dollar amount of credit exposure with any one institution.As part of the company's financial risk management processes, it continuously evaluates the relative credit standing of all of the financial institutions that service Corteva and monitors actual exposures versus established limits. The company has not sustained credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions.The company's sales are not materially dependent on any single customer. Credit risk associated with its receivables balance is representative of the geographic, industry and customer diversity associated with the company's global product lines.The company also maintains strong credit controls in evaluating and granting customer credit. As a result, it may require that customers provide some type of financial guarantee in certain circumstances. Length of terms for customer credit varies by region. 61Table Of ContentsPart II",2023-12-30 21:51:30.983311
