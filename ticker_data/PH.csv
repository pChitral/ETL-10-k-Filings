76334,PH,PARKER HANNIFIN CORP,2016,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. All statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments are forward-looking statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the Company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the Company's ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.Among other factors which may affect future performance are:•changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments, disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs, and changes in product mix;•ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets;•uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions;•the ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures;•the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities;•ability to implement successfully the Company's capital allocation initiatives, including timing, price and execution of share repurchases;•increases in raw material costs that cannot be recovered in product pricing; •the Company's ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits;•threats associated with and efforts to combat terrorism and cyber-security risks;•uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals;•competitive market conditions and resulting effects on sales and pricing; and•global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability.The Company makes these statements as of the date of the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law.17Table of ContentsOverviewThe Company's order rates provide a near-term perspective of the Company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders. The Company believes the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the Company's future order rates are as follows:•Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activity specific to regions around the world with respect to most mobile and industrial markets;•Global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles for commercial aerospace markets and Department of Defense spending for military aerospace markets; and•Housing starts with respect to the North American residential air conditioning market and certain mobile construction markets. A PMI above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding. A PMI below 50 indicates the opposite. Recent PMI levels for some regions around the world were as follows: June 30, 2016 March 31, 2016 June 30, 2015United States53.2 51.8 53.5Eurozone countries52.8 51.6 52.5China48.6 49.7 49.4Brazil43.2 46.0 46.5 Global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles have both increased approximately six percent from their comparable 2015 level. The Company anticipates that U.S. Department of Defense spending with regards to appropriations, and operations and maintenance for the U.S. Government's fiscal year 2016 will increase by approximately one percent from the comparable fiscal 2015 level. Housing starts in June 2016 were approximately nine percent higher than housing starts in March 2016 but were two percent lower than housing starts in June 2015. The Company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash. The Company continues to generate substantial cash flows from operations, has controlled capital spending and has proactively managed working capital. The Company has been able to borrow needed funds at affordable interest rates and had a debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio of 39.9 percent at June 30, 2016 compared to 39.3 percent at March 31, 2016 and 36.6 percent at June 30, 2015. Net of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments, the debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 16.9 percent at June 30, 2016 compared to 18.6 percent at March 31, 2016 and 16.8 percent at June 30, 2015.The Company believes many opportunities for growth are available. The Company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation. The Company believes it can meet its strategic objectives by:•Serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the Company;•Successfully executing its Win Strategy initiatives relating to premier customer service, financial performance and profitable growth;•Maintaining its decentralized division and sales company structure;•Fostering an entrepreneurial culture;•Engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;18Table of Contents•Delivering products, systems and services that have demonstrable savings to customers and are priced by the value they deliver; •Acquiring strategic businesses; •Organizing around targeted regions, technologies and markets;•Driving efficiency by implementing lean enterprise principles; and •Creating a culture of empowerment through its values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.Acquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit, while at the same time maintaining the Company’s strong financial position. The Company will continue to assess its existing businesses and initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the Company. Future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the Company’s results of operations. The discussion below is structured to separately discuss the financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term ""year"" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year.Discussion of Consolidated Statement of Income The Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance over the last three years.(dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2014Net sales $11,361 $12,712 $13,216Gross profit margin 22.3% 24.0% 22.9%Selling, general and administrative expenses $1,359 $1,545 $1,634Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales 12.0% 12.2% 12.4%Goodwill and intangible asset impairment $— $— $189Interest expense 137 118 83Other (income), net (62) (43) (26)(Gain) loss on disposal of assets (11) 4 (409)Effective tax rate 27.6% 29.3% 33.1%Net income attributable to common shareholders $807 $1,012 $1,041Net sales in 2016 were 10.6 percent lower than 2015. Acquisitions made in the last 12 months contributed approximately $42 million in sales in 2016 and the effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2016 by approximately $403 million. Excluding the effect of acquisitions and currency rate changes, net sales in 2016 were 7.8 percent lower than 2015 primarily due to a decrease in volume in the both the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International operations.Net sales in 2015 were 3.8 percent lower than 2014. Acquisitions made in 2015 contributed approximately $14 million in sales in 2015 and the effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2015 by approximately $547 million. Excluding the effect of acquisitions and currency rate changes, net sales in 2015 were essentially unchanged from 2014 as an increase in volume experienced in the Diversified Industrial North American operations and the Aerospace Systems Segment was offset by lower volume experienced in the Diversified Industrial International operations. Gross profit margin decreased in 2016 primarily due to both lower sales volume, resulting in manufacturing inefficiencies, and higher business realignment charges in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by favorable product mix and lower engineering costs in the Aerospace Systems Segment. Gross profit margin increased in 2015 primarily due to lower business realignment charges in the Diversified Industrial International operations and lower product support costs in the Aerospace Systems Segment. Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (relating to cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions) included in cost of sales for 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $22.7 million, $(77.8) million and $5.4 million, respectively. Pension cost included in cost of sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $172.4 million, $169.8 million and $174.8 million, respectively. Included in cost of sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were business realignment charges of $76.2 million, $19.4 million and $63.6 million, respectively.19Table of ContentsSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 12.0 percent in 2016 and decreased 5.5 percent in 2015. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower research and development expenses, lower incentive compensation expense and lower stock compensation expense, partially offset by higher business realignment charges. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015 was primarily due to lower business realignment charges and stock compensation expense, partially offset by higher net expenses associated with the Company's deferred compensation programs. The decrease in stock compensation expense in 2016 is primarily due to fewer stock awards granted. The decrease in stock compensation expense in 2015 is primarily due to a lower fair value calculated for 2015 stock awards as well as fewer stock awards granted. Pension cost included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $74.4 million, $69.6 million and $64.2 million, respectively. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were business realignment charges of $21.1 million, $12.9 million and $38.9 million, respectively.Goodwill and intangible asset impairment related to the Worldwide Energy Products Division. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Interest expense in 2016 increased primarily due to higher weighted-average borrowings and higher weighted-average interest rates. Interest expense in 2015 increased primarily due to higher weighted-average interest rates. Other (income), net in 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes $25.6 million, $23.2 million and $11.1 million of income, respectively, related to the Company's equity interests in joint ventures. (Gain) loss on disposal of assets includes a gain of $11.5 million related to the sale of businesses in 2016 and a gain of $412.6 million related to the deconsolidation of a subsidiary in 2014.Effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by an increase of discrete tax benefits, an increase in the U.S. Research and Development credit, and an increase in the U.S. Foreign Tax Credit. These benefits were partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. The effective tax rate in 2015 was favorably impacted by the re-enactment of the U.S. Research and Development credit, an increase in the federal manufacturing deduction and the absence of discrete tax costs incurred in the prior year. These benefits were partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings.Discussion of Business Segment InformationThe Business Segment information presents sales, operating income and assets on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making. Diversified Industrial Segment (dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2014Sales North America$4,955 $5,716 $5,694International4,145 4,741 5,288Operating income North America790 956 946International448 584 572Operating income as a percent of sales North America15.9% 16.7% 16.6%International10.8% 12.3% 10.8%Backlog$1,455 $1,586 $1,861Assets8,729 8,735 9,471Return on average assets14.2% 16.9% 16.1%Sales in 2016 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations decreased 13.3 percent from 2015 compared to remaining relatively flat between 2014 and 2015. Acquisitions completed within the last 12 months contributed approximately $8 million in sales in 2016 and the effect of currency exchange rates decreased sales in 2016 by $60 million. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2016 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations decreased 12.4 percent from 2015 reflecting lower demand from distributors and end-users in most markets. The markets that 20Table of Contentsexperienced the largest decline in end-user demand were the oil and gas, construction equipment and farm and agriculture equipment markets. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2015 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 1.2 percent from 2014 reflecting higher demand from distributors as well as from end-users in the car and light truck, heavy-duty truck, refrigeration and air conditioning and construction equipment markets, partially offset by lower demand in the farm and agriculture equipment market. Sales in the Diversified Industrial International operations decreased 12.6 percent in 2016 after a decrease of 10.3 percent from 2014 to 2015. Acquisitions completed within the last 12 months contributed approximately $34 million in sales in 2016. The effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by $338 million, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2016 in the Diversified Industrial International operations decreased 6.1 percent from 2015, primarily due to lower volume in all regions, with approximately 55 percent of the decrease occurring in Europe and approximately 35 percent of the decrease occurring in the Asia Pacific region. Within these regions, the largest decrease in sales was experienced from distributors and end-users in the oil and gas, marine, engine and construction equipment markets. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2015 in the Diversified Industrial International operations decreased 1.3 percent from 2014 primarily due to higher volume in the Asia Pacific region being more than offset by lower volume in Europe, approximately two-thirds of which was due to the absence of sales from divested businesses, and in Latin America. The decrease in operating margins in 2016 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations was primarily due to the lower sales volume and higher business realignment charges, partially offset by lower operating expenses primarily resulting from the Company's Simplification initiative. The decrease in operating margins in 2016 in the Diversified Industrial International operations was primarily due to the lower sales volume, an unfavorable product mix and higher business realignment charges, partially offset by lower operating expenses primarily resulting from the Company's Simplification initiative and prior-year restructuring activities. The increase in operating margins in 2015 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations was primarily due to the higher sales volume, a favorable product mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by higher warehouse, shipping, and manufacturing support costs, research and development expenses and raw material costs. Diversified Industrial North American margins in 2015 were also adversely affected by a voluntary retirement expense of $12.7 million. The increase in operating margins in 2015 in the Diversified Industrial International operations was primarily due to lower fixed overhead costs and lower business realignment charges in the current-year, partially offset by higher raw material costs due to changes in currency exchange rates.The following business realignment charges are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income: (dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2014Diversified Industrial North America $31 $4 $2Diversified Industrial International 60 27 99The business realignment charges consist primarily of severance costs related to actions taken under the Company's Simplification initiative implemented by operating units throughout the world as well as plant closures. The majority of the Diversified Industrial International business realignment charges were incurred in Europe. In addition to the business realignment charges presented in the table above, the Company recognized $12 million of expense associated with enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a plant closure during 2016. The Company anticipates that cost savings realized from the work force reduction measures taken during 2016 will increase 2017 operating income by approximately 11 percent in the Diversified Industrial North American business and by approximately 13 percent in the Diversified Industrial International business. In 2017, the Company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment. Such actions are expected to result in approximately $48 million in business realignment charges in 2017. The Company anticipates Diversified Industrial North American sales for 2017 will range from a decrease of five percent to a decrease of one percent from the 2016 level and Diversified Industrial International sales for 2017 will increase between one percent and five percent from the 2016 level. Diversified Industrial North American operating margins in 2017 are expected to range from 16.7 percent to 17.1 percent and Diversified Industrial International margins are expected to range from 12.5 percent to 12.9 percent.The decrease in total Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2016 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders primarily in North America and Europe, with North America accounting for approximately 70 percent of the decrease and 21Table of ContentsEurope accounting for approximately 30 percent of the decrease. The decrease in total Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2015 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in all regions. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. The decrease in total Diversified Industrial Segment assets in 2016 was primarily due to the effect of currency rate fluctuations and a decrease in prepaid expenses, inventory, intangible assets, trade accounts receivable, net and plant and equipment, net, partially offset by an increase in marketable securities and other investments, cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and goodwill. The decrease in total Diversified Industrial Segment assets in 2015 was primarily due to the effect of currency rate fluctuations and a decrease in trade accounts receivable, net, non-trade and notes receivable and intangible assets, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents and other assets.Aerospace Systems Segment (dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2014Sales$2,260 $2,255 $2,235Operating income338 299 271Operating income as a percent of sales14.9% 13.3% 12.1%Backlog$1,762 $1,756 $1,994Assets1,431 1,376 1,359Return on average assets24.1% 21.9% 21.7%Sales in 2016 were higher than the 2015 level as higher volume in the military original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and commercial and military aftermarket businesses was partially offset by lower volume in the commercial OEM business. Sales in 2015 were higher than the 2014 level as higher volume in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses was partially offset by lower volume in the military OEM business.The higher margin in 2016 was primarily due to a favorable product mix, favorable contract settlements, lower engineering development expenses and lower operating costs. The higher margin in 2015 was primarily due to the higher sales volume and lower engineering and development costs partially offset by a voluntary retirement expense of $5.4 million. Margins in 2015 and 2014 were favorably impacted by the finalization of contract negotiations related to certain programs. The increase in backlog in 2016 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the military OEM and commercial and military aftermarket businesses, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the commercial OEM business. The decrease in backlog in 2015 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in all businesses of the Aerospace Systems Segment. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. For 2017, sales are expected to increase between one percent and three percent from the 2016 level and operating margins are expected to range from 15.1 percent to 15.5 percent. A higher concentration of commercial OEM volume in future product mix and higher than expected new product development costs could result in lower margins.The increase in assets in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in trade accounts receivable, net and other assets, partially offset by a decrease in inventory. The increase in assets in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in inventory and other assets, partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable, net.Corporate general and administrative expenses were $173.2 million in 2016 compared to $215.4 million in 2015 and $181.9 million in 2014. As a percent of sales, corporate general and administrative expenses were 1.5 percent of sales compared to 1.7 percent in 2015 and 1.4 percent in 2014. The lower expense in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in research and development expense and lower incentive compensation expense. The higher expense in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation expense and higher net expenses associated with the Company's deferred compensation programs. Corporate general and administrative expenses in 2015 included $3.1 million in voluntary retirement expense.22Table of ContentsCorporate assets decreased 12.5 percent in 2016 compared to a decrease of 10.8 percent from 2014 to 2015. The decrease in Corporate assets in 2016 was primarily due to decreases in marketable securities and other investments, non-trade and notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents and the effect of currency rate fluctuations, partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes. The decrease in Corporate assets in 2015 was primarily due to the effect of currency rate fluctuations and changes in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and other investments, non-trade and notes receivable, deferred income taxes and other assets.Other expense (income) (in the Business Segment Information) (dollars in millions)2016 2015 2014Foreign currency transaction$23 $(78) $5Stock compensation49 57 71Pensions116 97 108Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns(11) 4 (409)Goodwill and intangible asset impairment— — 189Interest income(18) (15) (11)Other items, net(8) 7 16 $151 $72 $(31)Foreign currency transaction primarily relates to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions. A significant portion of the foreign currency transaction gain in 2015 related to intercompany loans and was attributable to the Swiss National Bank lifting the cap on the fluctuation of the exchange rate used to measure the Swiss Franc against the Euro. The Company has since settled these particular intercompany loans. The decrease in stock compensation expense in 2016 is primarily due to fewer stock awards granted. The decrease in stock compensation expense in 2015 is primarily due to a lower fair value calculated for 2015 stock awards as well as fewer stock awards granted. Included in divestitures and asset sales and writedowns for 2014 is a gain of approximately $413 million resulting from the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Discussion of Consolidated Balance SheetThe Consolidated Balance Sheet shows the Company's financial position at year-end, compared with the previous year-end. This discussion provides information to assist in assessing factors such as the Company's liquidity and financial resources. (dollars in millions) 2016 2015Cash $2,104 $1,914Trade accounts receivable, net 1,594 1,620Inventories 1,173 1,300Shareholders' equity 4,575 5,104Working capital $2,842 $3,092Current ratio 2.2 2.3Cash (comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments) includes $2,065 million and $1,777 million held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Generally, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments held by foreign subsidiaries are not readily available for use in the United States without adverse tax consequences. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash flows provided by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or borrowings directly from its line of credit. The Company does not believe the level of its non-U.S. cash position will have an adverse effect on working capital needs, planned growth, repayment of maturing debt, benefit plan funding, dividend payments or share repurchases.Trade accounts receivable, net are receivables due from customers for sales of product. Days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the Company was 49 days in 2016 and 48 days in 2015. The Company believes that its receivables are collectible and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts have been recorded. Inventories decreased $127 million from 2015 (which includes a decrease of $17 million from the effect of foreign currency translation and an increase of $7 million from current-year acquisitions). The decrease in inventories was primarily in the 23Table of ContentsDiversified Industrial Segment, with the decrease occurring evenly between the Diversified Industrial North American businesses and the Diversified Industrial International businesses. Days supply of inventory on hand was 62 days in 2016 and 65 days in 2015.Shareholders' equity activity during 2016 included a decrease of $558 million related to share repurchases, a decrease of $205 million related to foreign currency translation adjustments and a decrease of $286 million related to pensions and postretirement benefits.Discussion of Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects cash inflows and outflows from the Company's operating, investing and financing activities.A summary of cash flows follows:(dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2014Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $1,170 $1,302 $1,388Investing activities (265) (579) (646)Financing activities (802) (1,045) (958)Effect of exchange rates (62) (111) 48Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $41 $(433) $(168)Cash Flows From Operating Activities in 2016 reflects a decrease in net income from 2015 of $205 million and an increase of $120 million for cash provided by working capital items. Cash flows from operating activities in 2015 reflects a reduction of $257 million for cash used by working capital items. Cash flow from operating activities in 2014 benefited from a $294 million increase in cash provided by working capital items, partially offset by a $184 million decrease in net income after consideration of non-cash items, including a $413 million gain on the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and a $189 million impairment charge. The Company also made voluntary cash contributions to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan of $200 million in 2016 and $75 million in 2014.Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities in 2016 and 2015 includes $51 million and $356 million, respectively, in net purchases of marketable securities and other investments. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2014 includes $625 million in purchases of marketable securities and other investments and $202 million in proceeds from the sale of a 50 percent equity interest in a subsidiary related to the joint venture with GE Aviation. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities during 2015 includes the issuance of $1,500 million of medium-term notes and the repayment of commercial paper notes outstanding at the time of the debt issuance. The Company repurchased 5.1 million common shares for $558 million during 2016 as compared to the repurchase of 11.1 million common shares for $1,394 million in 2015 and 1.7 million common shares for $200 million in 2014.Dividends have been paid for 264 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 60 years. The current annual dividend rate is $2.52 per common share.The Company's goal is to maintain no less than an ""A"" rating on senior debt to ensure availability and reasonable cost of external funds. As a means of achieving this objective, the Company has established a financial goal of maintaining a ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity of no more than 37 percent. From time to time, such as at June 30, 2016, fluctuations in cash flows from operations or capital deployment actions may cause the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity to exceed the 37 percent goal. The Company does not believe that its ability to borrow funds at affordable interest rates has been or will be impacted when the debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio temporarily exceeds 37 percent.Debt to Debt-Shareholders' Equity Ratio (dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Debt $3,037 $2,947 Debt & Shareholders' Equity 7,612 8,051 Ratio 39.9% 36.6%24Table of ContentsAs of June 30, 2016, the Company had a line of credit totaling $2,000 million through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, $1,696 million of which was available at June 30, 2016. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.The Company is currently authorized to sell up to $1,850 million of short-term commercial paper notes. There were $304 million outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2016, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the last quarter of 2016 was $541 million.The Company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt agreements contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the applicable agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the applicable agreements. The Company is in compliance with all covenants and expects to remain in compliance during the term of the credit agreements and indentures.Contractual Obligations - The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was $152 million at June 30, 2016. Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the Company's fixed contractual obligations.

The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.Revenue Recognition - Substantially all of the Diversified Industrial Segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally at the time the product is shipped. The Aerospace Systems Segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentage-of-completion method and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the units-of-delivery method. The Company estimates costs to complete long-term contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves. The estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. Adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues. Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - Goodwill is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. For the Company, a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level. Determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which the Company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model. The Company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model 25Table of Contentsresults in the most accurate calculation of a reporting unit's fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available. The discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis. The Company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital, adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. The Company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the Company's overall market capitalization. The results of the Company's 2016 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of December 31, 2015 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed. During 2014, the Company made a decision to restructure and change the strategic direction of its Worldwide Energy Products Division (EPD). The Company calculated the fair value of EPD using assumptions reflecting the Company's current strategic direction for this reporting unit, the results of which indicated that the carrying value of EPD exceeded its fair value. As a result, the Company estimated the implied fair value of EPD's goodwill, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $140 million. The fair value of EPD was calculated using both a discounted cash flow analysis and estimated fair market values of comparable businesses. The Company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate. The Company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units. If actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units, especially assumptions regarding penetration into new markets and the recovery of the current economic environment, it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests. Long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. During 2016, there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the Company's long-lived assets held for use were not recoverable. During 2014, in connection with the goodwill impairment review discussed above, the Company determined certain intangible assets of EPD, primarily trademarks and customer lists, and plant and equipment were impaired resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $49 million. The fair value of EPD's intangible assets and plant and equipment were determined using the income approach for each asset. Pensions - The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. Beginning in 2017, the Company will change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to relevant cash outflows. Previously, these costs were determined using a single-weighted average discount rate. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company's benefit obligations. The new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and will be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 is expected to be lower by approximately $33 million compared to the previous method. Annual net periodic postretirement cost is not expected to be materially different.For the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a $12 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $31 million. As of June 30, 2016, $1,535 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. These losses will generally be amortized over approximately eight years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. Actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the actuarial loss amortization. Further information on pensions is provided in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.26Table of ContentsIncome Taxes - Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Loss Contingencies - The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. These loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gains or losses on derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Gains or losses on derivatives that are hedges are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt existing at June 30, 2016 by approximately $6 million.",2023-12-30 21:47:57.146329

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. All statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments are forward-looking statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the Company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the Company's ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.Among other factors which may affect future performance are:•changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments;•disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs, and changes in product mix;•ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions, including the integration of Clarcor; ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures;•the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities;•ability to implement successfully the Company's capital allocation initiatives, including timing, price and execution of share repurchases;•availability, limitations or cost increases of raw materials, component products and/or commodities that cannot be recovered in product pricing; •ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits;•compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations;•potential labor disruptions;•threats associated with and efforts to combat terrorism and cyber-security risks;•uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals;•competitive market conditions and resulting effects on sales and pricing; and•global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability.The Company makes these statements as of the date of the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law.18Table of ContentsOverviewThe Company's order rates provide a near-term perspective of the Company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders. The Company believes the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the Company's future order rates are as follows:•Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activity specific to regions around the world with respect to most mobile and industrial markets;•Global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles for commercial aerospace markets and Department of Defense spending for military aerospace markets; and•Housing starts with respect to the North American residential air conditioning market and certain mobile construction markets. A PMI above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding. A PMI below 50 indicates the opposite. Recent PMI levels for some regions around the world were as follows: June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 June 30, 2016United States57.8 57.2 52.8Eurozone countries57.4 56.2 52.8China50.4 51.2 48.6Brazil50.5 49.6 43.2 Global aircraft miles flown increased by approximately six percent and global revenue passenger miles increased approximately seven percent from their comparable 2016 levels. The Company anticipates that U.S. Department of Defense spending with regards to appropriations, and operations and maintenance for the U.S. Government's fiscal year 2017 will increase slightly from the comparable fiscal 2016 level. Housing starts in June 2017 were unchanged from housing starts in March 2017 but were two percent higher than housing starts in June 2016. The Company believes many opportunities for growth are available. The Company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation. The Company believes it can meet its strategic objectives by:•Serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the Company;•Successfully executing its Win Strategy initiatives relating to premier customer service, financial performance and profitable growth;•Maintaining its decentralized division and sales company structure;•Fostering an entrepreneurial culture;•Engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;•Delivering products, systems and services that have demonstrable savings to customers and are priced by the value they deliver; •Acquiring strategic businesses; •Organizing around targeted regions, technologies and markets;•Driving efficiency by implementing lean enterprise principles; and •Creating a culture of empowerment through its values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.19Table of ContentsDuring 2017, the Company completed three acquisitions, including the acquisition of Clarcor which is further discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Acquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit, while at the same time maintaining the Company’s strong financial position. The Company will continue to assess its existing businesses and initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the Company. Future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the Company’s results of operations. The discussion below is structured to separately discuss the financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term ""year"" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year.Discussion of Consolidated Statement of Income The Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance over the last three years.(dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2015Net sales $12,029 $11,361 $12,712Gross profit margin 23.6% 22.3% 24.0%Selling, general and administrative expenses $1,454 $1,359 $1,545Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales 12.1% 12.0% 12.2%Interest expense 162 137 118Other (income), net (61) (62) (43)(Gain) loss on disposal of assets (43) (11) 4Effective tax rate 26.0% 27.6% 29.3%Net income attributable to common shareholders $983 $807 $1,012Net sales in 2017 were 5.9 percent higher than 2016. The increase in net sales in 2017 was primarily a result of acquisitions made in the last 12 months (which contributed approximately $558 million in sales in 2017) and an increase in volume in both the Diversified Industrial International operations and the Aerospace Systems Segment, partially offset by the effect of currency rate changes (which decreased net sales in 2017 by approximately $84 million). Net sales in 2016 were 10.6 percent lower than 2015. The decrease in net sales in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in volume in both the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International operations and the effect of currency rate changes (which decreased net sales in 2016 by approximately $403 million), partially offset by sales from acquisitions (which contributed approximately $42 million in sales in 2016).Gross profit margin increased in 2017 primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the Company's simplification initiative and other restructuring activities, primarily experienced in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by lower margins in the Aerospace Systems Segment and higher amortization expense in the Diversified Industrial Segment. Gross profit margin decreased in 2016 primarily due to both lower sales volume, resulting in manufacturing inefficiencies, and higher business realignment charges in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by a favorable product mix and lower engineering costs in the Aerospace Systems Segment. Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (relating to cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions) included in cost of sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $8.1 million, $22.7 million and $(77.8) million, respectively. Pension cost included in cost of sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $135.0 million, $172.4 million and $169.8 million, respectively. Included in cost of sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were business realignment charges of $35.9 million, $76.2 million and $19.4 million, respectively.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.0 percent in 2017 and decreased 12.0 percent in 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher amortization expense resulting from current-year acquisitions and higher acquisition expenses partially offset by lower expenses resulting from the Company's simplification initiative, lower expenses associated with the Company's deferred compensation program and lower professional services expenses. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower research and development expenses, lower incentive compensation expense and lower stock compensation expense, partially offset by higher business realignment charges. Pension cost included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $65.8 million, $74.4 million and $69.6 million, respectively. Included in 20Table of Contentsselling, general and administrative expenses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were business realignment charges of $19.7 million, $21.1 million and $12.9 million, respectively.Interest expense in 2017 increased primarily due to higher weighted-average borrowings partially offset by lower weighted-average interest rates. Interest expense in 2016 increased primarily due to higher weighted-average borrowings and higher weighted-average interest rates. Other (income), net in 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes $42.4 million, $25.6 million and $23.2 million of income, respectively, related to the Company's equity interests in joint ventures. (Gain) loss on disposal of assets includes a gain of $42 million related to the sale of a product line in 2017 and a gain of $11.5 million related to the sale of businesses in 2016.Effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase of discrete tax benefits, mostly related to stock-based compensation expense. The effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by an increase of discrete tax benefits, an increase in the U.S. Research and Development credit, and an increase in the U.S. Foreign Tax Credit. These benefits were partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. Discussion of Business Segment InformationThe Business Segment information presents sales, operating income and assets on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making. Diversified Industrial Segment (dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2015Sales North America$5,367 $4,955 $5,716International4,378 4,145 4,741Operating income North America874 790 956International579 448 584Operating income as a percent of sales North America16.3% 15.9% 16.7%International13.2% 10.8% 12.3%Backlog$2,041 $1,455 $1,586Assets13,367 8,729 8,735Return on average assets13.1% 14.2% 16.9%Sales in 2017 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 8.3 percent from 2016 compared to decreasing 13.3 percent between 2015 and 2016. Acquisitions completed within the last 12 months contributed approximately $436 million in sales in 2017 and the effect of currency exchange rates decreased sales in 2017 by $17 million. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations remained flat from 2016 reflecting higher demand from distributors being offset by lower demand from end-users in the heavy-duty truck, cars and light trucks, life sciences, and oil and gas markets. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2016 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations decreased 12.4 percent from 2015 reflecting lower demand from distributors and end-users in most markets. The markets that experienced the largest decline in end-user demand were the oil and gas, construction equipment and farm and agriculture equipment markets. Sales in the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 5.6 percent in 2017 after a decrease of 12.6 percent from 2015 to 2016. Acquisitions completed within the last 12 months contributed approximately $121 million in sales in 2017. The effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by $66 million, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone countries and China. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 4.3 percent from 2016, primarily due to higher volume in the Asia Pacific region and Latin America, partially offset by lower volume in Europe. Within the Asia Pacific region, higher demand was experienced from distributors as well as end-users in the semiconductor, cars and light 21Table of Contentstrucks, telecommunications, construction equipment and engine markets. Within Latin America, higher demand was experienced from distributors and end-user demand in the agriculture equipment market. Within Europe, higher demand from distributors and end-user demand in the construction equipment, forestry, and miscellaneous manufacturing markets was more than offset by lower end-user demand in the general industrial machinery, oil and gas, and marine markets. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2016 in the Diversified Industrial International operations decreased 6.1 percent from 2015, primarily due to lower volume in all regions, with approximately 55 percent of the decrease occurring in Europe and approximately 35 percent of the decrease occurring in the Asia Pacific region. Within these regions, the largest decrease in sales was experienced from distributors and end-users in the oil and gas, marine, engine, and construction equipment markets.The increase in operating margins in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations was primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the Company's simplification initiative and other restructuring activities, resulting in manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by higher acquisition-related expenses and higher amortization expense. The increase in operating margins in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial International operations was primarily due to the higher sales volume, lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring activities and the Company's simplification initiative, resulting in manufacturing efficiencies. The decrease in operating margins in 2016 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations was primarily due to the lower sales volume and higher business realignment charges, partially offset by lower operating expenses primarily resulting from the Company's simplification initiative. The decrease in operating margins in 2016 in the Diversified Industrial International operations was primarily due to the lower sales volume, an unfavorable product mix and higher business realignment charges, partially offset by lower operating expenses primarily resulting from the Company's simplification initiative and prior-year restructuring activities. The following business realignment charges are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income: (dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2015Diversified Industrial North America $20 $31 $4Diversified Industrial International 33 60 27The business realignment charges consist primarily of severance costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative implemented by operating units throughout the world as well as plant closures. The majority of the Diversified Industrial International business realignment charges were incurred in Europe. In addition to the business realignment charges presented in the table above, the Company recognized $12 million of expense associated with enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a plant closure during 2016. The Company anticipates that cost savings realized from the work force reduction measures taken during 2017 will increase 2018 operating income by approximately three percent in the Diversified Industrial North American operations and by approximately four percent in the Diversified Industrial International operations. In 2018, the Company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment, including the integration of 2017 acquisitions. Such actions are expected to result in approximately $110 million in charges in 2018. The Company anticipates Diversified Industrial North American sales for 2018 will increase between 19 and 23 percent from the 2017 level and Diversified Industrial International sales for 2018 will increase between eight percent and 12 percent from the 2017 level. The primary driver for the increase in sales in 2018 in both the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International businesses is expected to be the sales contribution from 2017 acquisitions. Diversified Industrial North American operating margins in 2018 are expected to range from 16.1 percent to 16.5 percent and Diversified Industrial International margins are expected to range from 13.4 percent to 13.8 percent.The increase in total Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2017 was primarily due to current-year acquisitions as well as orders exceeding shipments in all regions, with North America and Europe each accounting for approximately 40 percent of the increase. The decrease in total Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2016 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders primarily in North America and Europe, with North America accounting for approximately 70 percent of the decrease and Europe accounting for approximately 30 percent of the decrease. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. 22Table of ContentsThe increase in total Diversified Industrial Segment assets in 2017 was primarily due to current-year acquisitions, partially offset by the effect of currency rate fluctuations. The decrease in total Diversified Industrial Segment assets in 2016 was primarily due to the effect of currency rate fluctuations and a decrease in prepaid expenses, inventory, intangible assets, trade accounts receivable, net and plant and equipment, net, partially offset by an increase in marketable securities and other investments, cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and goodwill.

Sales in 2016 were higher than the 2015 level as higher volume in the military OEM and commercial and military aftermarket businesses was partially offset by lower volume in the commercial OEM business. The slightly lower margin in 2017 was primarily due to an unfavorable OEM product mix, higher warranty-related costs, higher favorable contract settlements in 2016, and higher business realignment expenses, partially offset by higher aftermarket profitability and lower engineering development and operating expenses. The higher margin in 2016 was primarily due to a favorable product mix, favorable contract settlements, lower engineering development expenses and lower operating costs. The decrease in backlog in 2017 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in the commercial and military OEM businesses, partially offset by orders exceeding shipments in the commercial and military aftermarket businesses. The increase in backlog in 2016 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the military OEM and commercial and military aftermarket businesses, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the commercial OEM business. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer.

For 2018, sales are expected to increase between one percent and three percent from the 2017 level and operating margins are expected to range from 15.5 percent to 15.9 percent. A higher concentration of commercial OEM volume in future product mix and higher than expected new product development costs could result in lower margins.The decrease in assets in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in trade accounts receivable, intangible assets and other assets, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents and inventory. The increase in assets in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in trade accounts receivable, net and other assets, partially offset by a decrease in inventory. Corporate general and administrative expenses were $172.6 million in 2017 compared to $173.2 million in 2016 and $215.4 million in 2015. As a percent of sales, corporate general and administrative expenses in 2017 were 1.4 percent of sales compared to 1.5 percent in 2016 and 1.7 percent in 2015. The lower expense in 2017 was primarily due to lower expenses associated with the Company's deferred compensation program as well as lower professional services fees. The lower expense in 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in research and development expense and lower incentive compensation expense. Corporate assets decreased 62.1 percent in 2017 compared to a decrease of 12.5 percent from 2015 to 2016. The decrease in Corporate assets in 2017 was primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and non-current deferred taxes. Decreases in these assets in 2017 primarily resulted from the Clarcor acquisition. The decrease in Corporate assets in 2016 was primarily due to decreases in marketable securities and other investments, non-trade and notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents and the effect of currency rate fluctuations, partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes. 23Table of ContentsOther expense (in the Business Segment Information) (dollars in millions)2017 2016 2015Foreign currency transaction$8 $23 $(78)Stock-based compensation52 49 57Pensions78 116 97Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns(43) (11) 4Interest income(12) (18) (15)Acquisition expenses41 — —Other items, net3 (8) 7 $127 $151 $72Foreign currency transaction primarily relates to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions. The lower pension expense in 2017 is primarily due to the use of the spot yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost. Previously, this cost component of net periodic pension cost was estimated using a single-weighted average discount rate. Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns in 2017 includes a gain on the sale of the Company's Autoline product line. Acquisition expenses in 2017 primarily relate to the Clarcor acquisition (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).Discussion of Consolidated Balance SheetThe Consolidated Balance Sheet shows the Company's financial position at year-end, compared with the previous year-end. This discussion provides information to assist in assessing factors such as the Company's liquidity and financial resources.

Generally, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments held by foreign subsidiaries are not readily available for use in the United States without adverse tax consequences. During 2017, the Company utilized approximately $1,774 million in cash from its foreign subsidiaries principally to fund the acquisition of Clarcor stock and foreign assets. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash flows provided by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or borrowings directly from its line of credit. The Company does not believe the level of its non-U.S. cash position will have an adverse effect on working capital needs, planned growth, repayment of maturing debt, benefit plan funding, dividend payments or share repurchases.Trade accounts receivable, net are receivables due from customers for sales of product. Days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the Company was 51 days in 2017 and 49 days in 2016. The Company believes that its receivables are collectible and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts have been recorded. 24Table of ContentsInventories increased $376 million from 2016 primarily due to acquisitions (which accounted for an increase of $295 million), as well an increase in inventories in the Diversified Industrial International businesses and the Aerospace Systems Segment. Days supply of inventory on hand was 67 days in 2017 and 62 days in 2016.Deferred income tax asset as of June 30, 2017 decreased compared to June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of the Clarcor acquisition. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Intangible assets and goodwill as of June 30, 2017 both increased compared to June 30, 2016 primarily due to current-year acquisitions. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Notes payable and long-term debt payable within one year and long-term debt as of June 30, 2017 increased from the June 30, 2016 amounts due primarily to new debt issuances as well as higher commercial paper notes outstanding. Refer to Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Shareholders' equity activity during 2017 included a decrease of $265 million related to share repurchases, a decrease of $82 million related to foreign currency translation adjustments and an increase of $385 million related to pensions and postretirement benefits.Discussion of Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects cash inflows and outflows from the Company's operating, investing and financing activities.A summary of cash flows follows:(dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2015Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $1,302 $1,211 $1,363Investing activities (3,365) (265) (579)Financing activities 1,783 (843) (1,106)Effect of exchange rates (57) (62) (111)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(337) $41 $(433)Cash Flows From Operating Activities in 2017 reflects an increase in net income from 2016 of $177 million and a reduction of $28 million for cash used by working capital items. Cash flows from operating activities in 2016 reflects a decrease in net income from 2015 of $205 million and an increase of $120 million for cash provided by working capital items. Cash flows from operating activities in 2015 reflects a reduction of $257 million for cash used by working capital items. The Company also made voluntary cash contributions to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan of $220 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2016.Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities in 2017 includes $4,069 million related to acquisition activity, primarily related to Clarcor. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes $814 million, $(51) million and $(356) million, respectively, in net maturities (purchases) of marketable securities and other investments. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities during 2017 included the issuance of approximately $2,646 million of notional borrowings of long-term debt as well as the repayment of long-term debt of approximately $381 million, which includes debt assumed in the Clarcor acquisition. The Company repurchased 2.0 million common shares for $265 million during 2017 as compared to the repurchase of 5.1 million common shares for $558 million in 2016 and 11.1 million common shares for $1,394 million in 2015.25Table of ContentsDividends have been paid for 268 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 61 years. The current annual dividend rate is $2.64 per common share.The Company’s goal is to maintain no less than an “A” rating on senior debt to ensure availability and reasonable cost of external funds. In periods following significant capital deployment, including for share repurchases or acquisitions, certain of the ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt may be, and at June 30, 2017 were, lower than the stated goal. The Company's ability to borrow funds at desirable tenors and interest rates in February 2017 was not significantly impacted by certain ratings on senior debt that were below an ""A"" level. The Company does not believe that its ability to borrow funds in the future at desirable tenors and affordable interest rates will be impacted if certain of its ratings are below an ""A"" level at the time of such borrowings. At June 30, 2017, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows: Fitch Ratings A-Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Baa1Standard & Poor's AAs of June 30, 2017, the Company had a line of credit totaling $2,000 million through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, $1,466 million of which was available at June 30, 2017. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.The Company is currently authorized to sell up to $2,000 million of short-term commercial paper notes. There were $534 million outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2017, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the last quarter of 2017 was $827 million.The Company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt agreements contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the applicable agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the applicable agreements. The Company is in compliance with all covenants and expects to remain in compliance during the term of the credit agreements and indentures.Contractual Obligations - The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was $163 million at June 30, 2017. Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the Company's fixed contractual obligations.

The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.Revenue Recognition - Substantially all of the Diversified Industrial Segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally at the time the product is shipped. The Aerospace Systems Segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentage-of-completion method and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the units-of-delivery method. The Company estimates costs to complete long-term contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves. The estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. Adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues. Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - Goodwill is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. For the Company, a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level. Determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which the Company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model. The Company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting unit's fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available. The discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis. The Company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital, adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. The Company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the Company's overall market capitalization. The results of the Company's 2017 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of December 31, 2016 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed. The Company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate. The Company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units. If actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units, especially assumptions regarding penetration into new markets and the recovery of the current economic environment, it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests. Long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. During 2017, there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the Company's long-lived assets held for use were not recoverable. Pensions - The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. Beginning in 2017, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to 27Table of Contentsrelevant cash outflows. Previously, these costs were determined using a single-weighted average discount rate. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company's benefit obligations. The new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and was accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 was lower by approximately $30 million compared to the previous method. Annual net periodic postretirement cost was not materially different.For the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a $14 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $26 million. As of June 30, 2017, $1,081 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. These losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. Actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the actuarial loss amortization. Further information on pensions is provided in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income Taxes - Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Loss Contingencies - The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. These loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gains or losses on derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Gains or losses on derivatives that are hedges are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt existing at June 30, 2017 by approximately $12 million.28Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:47:57.312053

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. All statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments are forward-looking statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the Company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the Company's ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. Additionally, the actual impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) may affect future performance and earnings projections as the amounts reflected in this period are preliminary estimates and exact amounts will not be determined until a later date, and there may be other judicial or regulatory interpretations of the TCJ Act that may also affect these estimates and the actual impact on the Company. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.Among other factors which may affect future performance are:•changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments;•disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs, and changes in product mix;•ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions, including the integration of CLARCOR Inc. (Clarcor); ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures;•the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities;•ability to implement successfully the Company's capital allocation initiatives, including timing, price and execution of share repurchases;•availability, limitations or cost increases of raw materials, component products and/or commodities that cannot be recovered in product pricing; •ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits;•compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations;•potential labor disruptions;•threats associated with and efforts to combat terrorism and cyber-security risks;•uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals;•global competitive market conditions, including global reactions to U.S. trade polices, and resulting effects on sales and pricing; and•global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability.The Company makes these statements as of the date of the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law.17Table of ContentsOverviewThe Company is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.The Company's order rates provide a near-term perspective of the Company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders. The Company believes the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the Company's future order rates are as follows:•Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activity specific to regions around the world with respect to most mobile and industrial markets;•Global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles for commercial aerospace markets and Department of Defense spending for military aerospace markets; and•Housing starts with respect to the North American residential air conditioning market and certain mobile construction markets. A PMI above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding. A PMI below 50 indicates the opposite. Recent PMI levels for some regions around the world were as follows: June 30, 2018 March 31, 2018 June 30, 2017United States60.2 59.3 57.8Eurozone countries54.9 56.6 57.4China51.0 51.0 50.4Brazil49.8 53.4 50.5 Global aircraft miles flown increased by approximately six percent and global revenue passenger miles increased approximately seven percent from their comparable 2017 levels. The Company anticipates that U.S. Department of Defense spending with regards to appropriations and operations and maintenance for the U.S. Government's fiscal year 2018 will increase by approximately two percent from their fiscal 2017 level. Housing starts in June 2018 were 11 percent lower than housing starts in March 2018 and four percent lower than housing starts in June 2017.The Company believes many opportunities for profitable growth are available. The Company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation. The Company believes it can meet its strategic objectives by:•Serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the Company;•Successfully executing its Win Strategy initiatives relating to engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance;•Maintaining its decentralized division and sales company structure;•Fostering a safety first and entrepreneurial culture;•Engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;•Delivering products, systems and services that have demonstrable savings to customers and are priced by the value they deliver; •Acquiring strategic businesses; •Organizing around targeted regions, technologies and markets;•Driving efficiency by implementing lean enterprise principles; and •Creating a culture of empowerment through its values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.18Table of ContentsAcquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit, while at the same time maintaining the Company’s strong financial position. In addition, the Company will continue to assess its existing businesses and initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the Company. Future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the Company’s results of operations.The discussion below is structured to separately discuss the financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term ""year"" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOMEThe Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance over the last three years.(dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2016Net sales $14,302 $12,029 $11,361Gross profit margin 24.7% 23.6% 22.3%Selling, general and administrative expenses $1,657 $1,454 $1,359Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales 11.6% 12.1% 12.0%Interest expense $214 $162 $137Other (income), net (29) (61) (62)(Gain) on disposal of assets (4) (43) (11)Effective tax rate 37.7% 26.0% 27.6%Net income attributable to common shareholders $1,061 $983 $807Net sales in 2018 were 18.9 percent higher than 2017. The increase in net sales in 2018 was a result of an increase in volume in both the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International operations and acquisitions completed during 2017, which contributed approximately $970 million to current-year incremental net sales. The effect of currency rate changes increased net sales in 2018 by approximately $295 million, of which $270 million was attributable to the Diversified Industrial International operations. Net sales in 2017 were 5.9 percent higher than 2016. The increase in net sales in 2017 was primarily a result of acquisitions made in 2017 (which contributed approximately $558 million in sales in 2017) and an increase in volume in both the Diversified Industrial International operations and the Aerospace Systems Segment, partially offset by the effect of currency rate changes (which decreased net sales in 2017 by approximately $84 million).Gross profit margin (calculated as net sales less cost of sales, divided by net sales) increased in 2018 primarily due to higher margins in the Aerospace Systems Segment resulting from a favorable product mix. All segments benefited from lower operating expenses related to simplification and realignment efforts. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable product mix, unfavorable raw material prices and inefficiencies created by manufacturing facility consolidations which contributed to lower margins in the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International operations during 2018. Gross profit margin increased in 2017 primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the Company's simplification initiative and other restructuring activities, primarily experienced in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by lower margins in the Aerospace Systems Segment. Foreign currency transaction loss (relating to cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions) included in cost of sales for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $7.3 million, $8.1 million and $22.7 million, respectively. Pension cost included in cost of sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $86.1 million, $135.0 million and $172.4 million, respectively. Included in cost of sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were business realignment charges of $44.9 million, $35.9 million and $76.2 million, respectively.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 14.0 percent in 2018 and increased 7.0 percent in 2017. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to higher sales expense resulting from an increase in sales, higher amortization expense resulting from recent acquisitions and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by lower acquisition expenses. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher amortization expense resulting from recent acquisitions and higher acquisition expenses, partially offset by lower expenses resulting from the Company's simplification initiative, lower expenses associated with the Company's deferred compensation program and lower professional services expenses. Pension cost included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $36.9 million, $65.8 million and $74.4 million, respectively. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were business realignment charges of $36.8 million, $19.7 million and $21.1 million, respectively.19Table of ContentsInterest expense in 2018 increased primarily due to higher weighted-average borrowings and higher weighted-average interest rates. Interest expense in 2017 increased primarily due to higher weighted-average borrowings, partially offset by lower weighted-average interest rates.Other (income), net in 2018, 2017 and 2016 includes $50.5 million, $42.4 million, and $25.6 million of income, respectively, related to the Company's equity interests in joint ventures. Other (income), net in 2018 also includes a writedown of an investment of $27.4 million and a loss on the sale of an investment of $13.8 million.(Gain) on disposal of assets includes a loss of $20 million on the sale of a business in 2018, a gain of $42 million related to the sale of a product line in 2017 and a gain of $11.5 million related to the sale of businesses in 2016.Effective tax rate in 2018 was higher than the comparable prior-year period primarily due to the net impact of one-time adjustments recorded as a result of the TCJ Act. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the impact of the TCJ Act. Excluding the impact of the TCJ Act one-time adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2018 was lower primarily due to the reduced U.S. income tax rate resulting from enactment of the TCJ Act and a net increase in discrete tax benefits, partially offset by an increase in taxes related to international activities. The effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase of discrete tax benefits, mostly related to stock-based compensation expense.BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Business Segment information presents sales, operating income and assets on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making.Diversified Industrial Segment (dollars in millions)2018 2017 2016Sales North America$6,727 $5,367 $4,955International5,260 4,378 4,145Operating income North America1,076 874 790International765 579 448Operating income as a percent of sales North America16.0% 16.3% 15.9%International14.5% 13.2% 10.8%Backlog$2,167 $2,041 $1,455Assets13,369 13,367 8,729Return on average assets13.8% 13.1% 14.2%20Table of ContentsThe Diversified Industrial Segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales: 2018 2017Diversified Industrial North America – as reported 25.3 % 8.3 %Acquisitions 14.9 % 8.8 %Divestitures (0.1)% — %Currency 0.4 % (0.3)%Diversified Industrial North America – without acquisitions, divestitures and currency 10.1 % (0.2)% Diversified Industrial International – as reported 20.1 % 5.6 %Acquisitions 3.9 % 2.9 %Divestitures (0.2)% — %Currency 6.2 % (1.6)%Diversified Industrial International – without acquisitions, divestitures and currency 10.2 % 4.3 % Total Diversified Industrial Segment – as reported 23.0 % 7.1 %Acquisitions 10.0 % 6.1 %Divestitures (0.2)% — %Currency 3.0 % (0.9)%Total Diversified Industrial Segment – without acquisitions, divestitures and currency 10.2 % 1.9 %The above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the Diversified Industrial Segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made within the prior four fiscal quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates (a non-GAAP measure). The effects of acquisitions, divestitures and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period.Sales in 2018 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 25.3 percent from 2017 as compared to increasing 8.3 percent from 2016 to 2017. Acquisitions completed during 2017 contributed approximately $798 million in incremental sales in 2018, and the effect of currency exchange rates increased sales in 2018 by $20 million. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2018 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 10.1 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, cars and light trucks, heavy-duty truck, oil and gas, and general industrial machinery markets. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2017 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations remained flat from 2016 levels reflecting higher demand from distributors offset by lower demand from end users in the heavy-duty truck, cars and light trucks, life sciences, and oil and gas markets.Sales in the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 20.1 percent in 2018 as compared to increasing 5.6 percent from 2016 to 2017. Acquisitions completed in 2017 contributed approximately $173 million in incremental sales in 2018. The effect of currency rate changes increased sales by $270 million, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the Eurozone countries, China and the United Kingdom. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2018 for the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 10.2 percent from 2017 levels due to higher volume in all regions. The Asia Pacific region contributed approximately 50 percent of the increase in sales due to higher demand from distributors as well as end users in the construction equipment, semiconductor and engine markets, partially offset by lower end-user demand in the telecommunications and marine markets. Europe contributed approximately 40 percent of the increase in sales due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, mining, heavy-duty truck and engine markets, partially offset by lower end-user demand in the power generation market. Within Latin America, higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment and heavy-duty truck markets contributed to the increase in sales.21Table of ContentsExcluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 4.3 percent from 2016, primarily due to higher volume in the Asia Pacific region and Latin America, partially offset by lower volume in Europe. Within the Asia Pacific region, higher demand was experienced from distributors as well as end users in the semiconductor, cars and light trucks, telecommunications, construction equipment and engine markets. Within Latin America, higher demand was experienced from distributors and end-user demand in the agriculture equipment market. Within Europe, higher demand from distributors and end-user demand in the construction equipment, forestry, and miscellaneous manufacturing markets was more than offset by lower end-user demand in the general industrial machinery, oil and gas, and marine markets.The lower operating margins in 2018 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations were primarily due to an unfavorable product mix, unfavorable raw material prices, higher amortization expense and inefficiencies created by manufacturing facility consolidations, partially offset by the impact of higher sales volume and lower operating expenses resulting from prior-year restructuring activities and the Company's simplification initiative. The increase in operating margins in 2018 for the Diversified Industrial International operations was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring activities and the Company's simplification initiative, partially offset by higher amortization expense, inefficiencies created by manufacturing facility consolidations and an unfavorable product mix.The increase in operating margins in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial North American operations was primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from the Company's simplification initiative and other restructuring activities, resulting in manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by higher acquisition-related expenses and higher amortization expense. The increase in operating margins in 2017 in the Diversified Industrial International operations was primarily due to the higher sales volume, lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring activities and the Company's simplification initiative, resulting in manufacturing efficiencies.The following business realignment charges and acquisition integration costs are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income: (dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2016Diversified Industrial North America $37 $20 $31Diversified Industrial International 41 33 60The business realignment charges consist primarily of severance and plant closure costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, which is being implemented by its operating units throughout the world. The majority of the Diversified Industrial International business realignment charges were incurred in Europe. In addition to the business realignment charges presented in the table above, the Company recognized $12 million of expense associated with enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a plant closure during 2016. The Company anticipates that cost savings realized from the work force reduction measures taken during 2018 will increase 2019 operating income by approximately three percent in both the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International operations. In 2019, the Company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment, including the continued integration of 2017 acquisitions. Such actions are expected to result in approximately $35 million in charges in 2019.The Company anticipates Diversified Industrial North American sales for 2019 will increase between 2.6 and 5.6 percent from the 2018 level and Diversified Industrial International sales for 2019 will range between a 2.5 percent decrease and 0.5 percent increase from the 2018 level. Diversified Industrial North American operating margins in 2019 are expected to range from 16.4 to 17.2 percent and Diversified Industrial International margins are expected to range from 15.3 to 15.7 percent.The increase in total Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2018 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the Asia Pacific region and North America, with the Asia Pacific region accounting for approximately 60 percent of the increase and North America accounting for approximately 40 percent of the increase. The increase in total Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2017 was primarily due to recent acquisitions as well as orders exceeding shipments in all regions, with North America and Europe each accounting for approximately 40 percent of the increase. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. 22Table of ContentsDiversified Industrial Segment assets in 2018 remained flat as compared to the 2017 balance. At June 30, 2018, increases in cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable were offset by a decrease in intangible assets. The increase in total Diversified Industrial Segment assets in 2017 was primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by the effect of currency rate fluctuations.

Sales in 2017 were higher than the 2016 level primarily due to higher volume in the military OEM and commercial and military aftermarket businesses, partially offset by lower volume in the commercial OEM business. The higher margin in 2018 was primarily due to a favorable product mix resulting from higher aftermarket volume and profitability and lower engineering development and operating expenses, partially offset by unfavorable contract settlements and higher product support costs. The slightly lower margin in 2017 was primarily due to an unfavorable OEM product mix, higher warranty-related costs, higher favorable contract settlements in 2016 and higher business realignment expenses, partially offset by higher aftermarket profitability and lower engineering development and operating expenses. The increase in backlog in 2018 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the commercial and military OEM businesses and the commercial and military aftermarket businesses. The decrease in backlog in 2017 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in the commercial and military OEM businesses, partially offset by orders exceeding shipments in the commercial and military aftermarket businesses. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. For 2019, sales are expected to increase between 2.5 and 4.5 percent from the 2018 level and operating margins are expected to range from 17.2 to 17.6 percent. A higher concentration of commercial OEM volume in future product mix and higher than expected new product development costs could result in lower margins.The increase in assets in 2018 was primarily due to increases in trade accounts receivable and other receivables, partially offset by a decrease in other assets. The decrease in assets in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in trade accounts receivable, intangible assets and other assets, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents and inventory. Corporate general and administrative expenses were $200.9 million in 2018 compared to $172.6 million in 2017 and $173.2 million in 2016. As a percent of sales, corporate general and administrative expenses in both 2018 and 2017 were 1.4 percent compared to 1.5 percent in 2016. The higher expense in 2018 was primarily due to higher expenses associated with the Company's incentive compensation programs. The lower expense in 2017 was primarily due to lower expenses associated with the Company's deferred compensation program as well as lower professional services fees.Corporate assets decreased 28.9 percent in 2018 compared to a decrease of 62.1 percent from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in Corporate assets in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in non-current deferred taxes. The decrease in Corporate assets in 2017 was primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and non-current deferred taxes. Decreases in these assets in 2017 primarily resulted from the Clarcor acquisition.23Table of ContentsOther expense (in the Business Segment Information) (dollars in millions) Expense (income)2018 2017 2016Foreign currency transaction$7 $8 $23Stock-based compensation51 52 49Pensions26 78 116Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns(4) (43) (11)Sale and writedown of investments41 — —Interest income(15) (12) (18)Acquisition expenses5 41 —Other items, net11 3 (8) $122 $127 $151Foreign currency transaction primarily relates to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions. The lower pension expense in 2018 is primarily due to a lower level of amortization of past actuarial losses. The lower pension expense in 2017 is primarily due to a change in methodology to use of the spot yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost instead of the single-weighted average discount rate. Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns in 2018 includes a net gain on the sale of assets, partially offset by a loss on the sale of the global Facet filtration business. Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns in 2017 includes a gain on the sale of the Company's Autoline product line. Acquisition expenses in 2017 primarily relate to Clarcor (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion).CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETThe Consolidated Balance Sheet shows the Company's financial position at year-end, compared with the previous year-end. This discussion provides information to assist in assessing factors such as the Company's liquidity and financial resources.

As a result of the TCJ Act, the prior worldwide tax system was replaced by a territorial tax system, which generally allows companies to repatriate future foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes. However, other U.S. or foreign taxes may be incurred should cash be distributed between the Company's subsidiaries. The Company has determined it will no longer permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings. All other undistributed foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Trade accounts receivable, net are receivables due from customers for sales of product. Days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the Company was 51 days in both 2018 and 2017. The Company believes that its receivables are collectible and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts have been recorded. Inventories increased $72 million from 2017 primarily due to a $107 million increase in inventories in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by a decrease of $20 million related to a sale of a business and a decrease of $10 million in the Aerospace Systems Segment. Days supply of inventory on hand was 64 days in 2018 and 67 days in 2017.24Table of ContentsShareholders' equity activity during 2018 included a decrease of $300 million related to share repurchases, an increase of $179 million related to pensions and postretirement benefits resulting from net actuarial gains and amortizations and a decrease of $18 million related to foreign currency translation adjustments. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWSThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects cash inflows and outflows from the Company's operating, investing and financing activities.A summary of cash flows follows:(dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2016Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $1,600 $1,302 $1,211Investing activities 20 (3,365) (265)Financing activities (1,682) 1,783 (843)Effect of exchange rates (1) (57) (62)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(63) $(337) $41Cash flows from operating activities in 2018 reflects an increase in net income from 2017 of $77 million and a reduction of $251 million for cash used by working capital items. Cash flows from operating activities in 2017 reflects an increase in net income from 2016 of $177 million and a reduction of $28 million for cash used by working capital items. Cash flows from operating activities in 2016 reflects an increase of $120 million for cash provided by working capital items. The Company also made discretionary cash contributions to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan of $220 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2016.Cash flows from investing activities in 2018 benefited from proceeds related to the sale of the global Facet filtration business, and sale of plant and equipment. Cash flows from investing activity in 2017 includes $4,069 million related to acquisition activities, primarily for the Clarcor acquisition. Cash flows from investing activities in 2018, 2017, and 2016 also includes $3 million, $814 million, and $(51) million, respectively, in net maturities (purchases) of marketable securities and other investments. Cash flows from financing activities during 2018 included the repayment of long-term debt of approximately $945 million. Cash flows from financing activities during 2017 included the issuance of approximately $2,646 million of notional borrowings of long-term debt as well as the repayment of long-term debt of approximately $381 million, which includes debt assumed in the Clarcor acquisition. The Company repurchased 1.7 million common shares for $300 million during 2018 as compared to the repurchase of 2.0 million common shares for $265 million in 2017 and 5.1 million common shares for $558 million in 2016.Dividends have been paid for 272 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 62 years. The current annual dividend rate is $3.04 per common share.The Company’s goal is to maintain no less than an “A” rating on senior debt to ensure availability and reasonable cost of external funds. In periods following significant capital deployment, including for share repurchases or acquisitions, certain of the ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt may be, and at June 30, 2018 and 2017 were, lower than the stated goal. The Company's ability to borrow funds at desirable tenors and interest rates in 2018 and 2017 was not significantly impacted by certain ratings on senior debt that were below an ""A"" level. The Company does not believe that its ability to borrow funds in the future at desirable tenors and affordable interest rates will be impacted if certain of its ratings are below an ""A"" level at the time of such borrowings. At June 30, 2018, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows: Fitch Ratings A-Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Baa1Standard & Poor's A25Table of ContentsAs of June 30, 2018, the Company had a line of credit totaling $2,000 million through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, of which $1,466 million was available at June 30, 2018. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.The Company is currently authorized to sell up to $2,000 million of short-term commercial paper notes. There were $534 million outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2018, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the last quarter of 2018 was $736 million.The Company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt agreements contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the applicable agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the applicable agreements. The Company is in compliance with all covenants and expects to remain in compliance during the term of the credit agreements and indentures.Contractual Obligations - The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was $175 million at June 30, 2018. Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the Company's fixed contractual obligations.

The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.Revenue Recognition - Substantially all of the Diversified Industrial Segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, which is generally at the time the product is shipped. The Aerospace Systems Segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentage-of-completion method, and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the units-of-delivery method. The Company estimates costs to complete long-term contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves. The estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. Adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues. 26Table of ContentsImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - Goodwill is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. For the Company, a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level. Determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which the Company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model. The Company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting unit's fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available. The discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis. The Company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital, adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. The Company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the Company's overall market capitalization. The results of the Company's 2018 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of December 31, 2017 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed. However, certain reporting units within the Diversified Industrial Segment had estimated fair values that the Company determined, from a quantitative and qualitative perspective, were not significantly in excess of their carrying values. For these reporting units, the sales growth assumptions had the most significant influence on the estimation of fair value. The key uncertainties in these sales growth assumptions include end-market growth, the ability to secure business with new customers and new product development. The Company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate. The Company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units. If actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests. Long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. During 2018, there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the Company's long-lived assets held for use were not recoverable. Pensions - The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. Beginning in 2017, the Company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs from the single-weighted average discount rate to spot yield curve approach. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company's benefit obligations. The new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and was accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 was lower by approximately $30 million compared to the previous method. Annual net periodic postretirement cost was not materially different.For the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a $14 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $17 million. As of June 30, 2018, $841 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. These losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. Actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization. Further information on pensions is provided in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.27Table of ContentsIncome Taxes - Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. On December 22, 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted into law. The TCJ Act significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, by among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and creating a territorial tax system (with a one time transition tax imposed on previously unremitted foreign earnings and profits). The Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the TCJ Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year of the TCJ Act’s enactment date, to complete the applicable accounting of the related tax impacts of the TCJ Act. The final impact of the TCJ Act may differ from the provisional amounts recorded in the current period, due to, among other things, any updates to estimates that have been utilized in the calculation of the tax impacts, changes in interpretation of the existing law, or additional guidance from U. S. Treasury department or the Internal Revenue Service.Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Loss Contingencies - The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. These loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gains or losses on derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Gains or losses on derivatives that are hedges are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt existing at June 30, 2018 by approximately $7 million.28Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:47:57.058742

The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders. We believe the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the Company's future order rates are as follows:•Purchasing Managers Index (""PMI"") on manufacturing activity specific to regions around the world with respect to most mobile and industrial markets;•Global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles for commercial aerospace markets and Department of Defense spending for military aerospace markets; and•Housing starts with respect to the North American residential air conditioning market and certain mobile construction markets.A PMI above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding. A PMI below 50 indicates the opposite. Recent PMI levels for some regions around the world were as follows: June 30, 2019 March 31, 2019 June 30, 2018United States50.6 55.3 60.2Eurozone countries47.6 47.5 54.9China49.4 50.8 51.0Brazil51.0 52.8 49.8 Global aircraft miles flown increased by approximately four percent and global revenue passenger miles increased approximately five percent from their comparable 2018 levels. The Company anticipates that U.S. Department of Defense spending with regards to appropriations and operations and maintenance for the U.S. Government's fiscal year 2019 will increase by approximately four percent from its fiscal 2018 level. Housing starts in June 2019 were 10 percent higher than housing starts in March 2019 and six percent higher than housing starts in June 2018.We believe many opportunities for profitable growth are available. The Company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation. We believe we can meet our strategic objectives by:•Serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the Company;•Successfully executing The Win Strategy initiatives relating to engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance;•Maintaining a decentralized division and sales company structure;•Fostering a safety first and entrepreneurial culture;•Engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;•Delivering products, systems and services that have demonstrable savings to customers and are priced by the value they deliver; •Acquiring strategic businesses; •Organizing around targeted regions, technologies and markets;•Driving efficiency by implementing lean enterprise principles; and •Creating a culture of empowerment through our values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.19Table of ContentsAcquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit, while at the same time maintaining the Company’s strong financial position. In addition, we will continue to assess our existing businesses and initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the Company. Future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the Company’s results of operations.The discussion below is structured to separately discuss the financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term ""year"" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year. Discussion of the 2017 financial statements is included in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOMEThe Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance over the last three years. The discussion below compares the operating performance in 2019 and 2018.(dollars in millions) 2019 2018Net sales $14,320 $14,302Gross profit margin 25.3% 24.9%Selling, general and administrative expenses $1,544 $1,640Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales 10.8% 11.5%Interest expense $190 $214Other (income) expense, net (61) 13Loss (gain) on disposal of assets 11 (4)Effective tax rate 21.7% 37.7%Net income attributable to common shareholders $1,512 $1,061Net sales in 2019 increased slightly from the 2018 amount. This change was a result of an increase in volume, primarily in the Aerospace Systems Segment, partially offset by the effect of currency rate changes. The effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2019 by approximately $305 million, of which $285 million was attributable to the Diversified Industrial International operations.Gross profit margin (calculated as net sales less cost of sales, divided by net sales) increased in 2019 primarily due to higher margins in the Aerospace Systems Segment driven by increased aftermarket and original equipment manufacturer (""OEM"") volume and profitability and lower engineering development costs. Lower operating costs in the Diversified Industrial Segment resulting from prior-year business realignment and acquisition integration activities and the Company's simplification initiative also contributed to higher margins in 2019. Foreign currency transaction loss included in cost of sales for 2019 and 2018 was $5.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively. Included in cost of sales in 2019 and 2018 were business realignment charges of $14.7 million and $44.9 million, respectively.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5.9 percent in 2019 primarily due to the benefits from prior-year business realignment and acquisition integration activities and the Company's simplification initiative, lower amortization expense and lower incentive compensation. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in acquisition-related expenses and higher net expense associated with the Company's deferred compensation program and related investments. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2019 and 2018 were business realignment charges of $13.2 million and $36.8 million, respectively.Interest expense in 2019 decreased primarily due to lower weighted-average interest rates, partially offset by higher weighted-average borrowings. 20Table of ContentsOther (income) expense, net included the following:(dollars in millions) Expense (income) 2019 2018Income related to equity method investments $(93) $(50)Non-service components of retirement benefit cost 40 42Sale and writedown of investments — 41Interest income (18) (15)Other items, net 10 (5) $(61) $13Loss (gain) on disposal of assets in 2018 includes a loss of $20 million on the sale of a business and a gain of $28 million on the sale of real estate.Effective tax rate in 2019 was lower than 2018 primarily due to the net impact of one-time adjustments that were recorded in the prior year as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJ Act"") and the reduced U.S. income tax rate in the current year resulting from enactment of the TCJ Act.BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Business Segment information presents sales, operating income and assets on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making.Diversified Industrial Segment (dollars in millions) 2019 2018Sales North America $6,809 $6,727International 5,001 5,260Operating income North America 1,139 1,076International 805 765Operating income as a percent of sales North America 16.7% 16.0%International 16.1% 14.5%Backlog $2,011 $2,16721Table of ContentsThe Diversified Industrial Segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales: 2019Diversified Industrial North America – as reported 1.2 %Divestitures (0.3)%Currency (0.3)%Diversified Industrial North America – without divestitures and currency 1.8 % Diversified Industrial International – as reported (4.9)%Divestitures (0.6)%Currency (5.4)%Diversified Industrial International – without divestitures and currency 1.1 % Total Diversified Industrial Segment – as reported (1.5)%Divestitures (0.5)%Currency (2.5)%Total Diversified Industrial Segment – without divestitures and currency 1.5 %The above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the Diversified Industrial Segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of divestitures made within the prior four fiscal quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates (a non-GAAP measure). The effects of divestitures and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period.Sales in 2019 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 1.2 percent from 2018. Divestitures and the effect of currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately $21 million and $17 million, respectively. Excluding divestitures and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2019 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 1.8 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users in the heavy-duty truck, engine, and construction equipment markets, partially offset by lower demand from end users in the oil and gas, marine, semiconductor and power generation markets. Sales in the Diversified Industrial International operations decreased 4.9 percent in 2019. Divestitures contributed approximately $31 million to the decrease in sales in 2019. The effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by $285 million, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the Eurozone countries, China and Brazil. Excluding divestitures and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2019 for the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 1.1 percent from 2018 levels due to slightly higher volume in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, partially offset by a decrease in sales in Europe. Within the Asia Pacific region, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors as well as end users in the construction equipment, oil and gas and engine markets, partially offset by lower end-user demand in the semiconductor, cars and light truck and industrial machinery markets. In Europe, higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, forestry and heavy-duty truck markets was offset by lower end-user demand in the general industrial machinery, cars and light truck, mills and foundries, machine tool and oil and gas markets. Within Latin America, distributors and end users in the farm and agricultural equipment and heavy-duty truck markets contributed to the increase in sales, partially offset by lower end-user demand in the power generation market.Operating margins in 2019 increased in both the Diversified Industrial North American and International operations primarily due to lower operating expenses resulting from prior-year business realignment and acquisition integration activities and the Company's simplification initiative, lower current-year business realignment expenses and lower intangible amortization expense, partially offset by higher warehouse and shipping costs. Higher manufacturing and materials support costs also impacted the Diversified Industrial North American operating margins.22Table of ContentsThe following business realignment charges and acquisition integration costs are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income: (dollars in millions) 2019 2018Diversified Industrial North America $13 $37Diversified Industrial International 15 41The business realignment charges consist primarily of severance and plant closure costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, which is being implemented by its operating units throughout the world. The majority of the Diversified Industrial International business realignment charges were incurred in Europe. The Company anticipates that cost savings realized from the work force reduction measures taken during 2019 will increase 2020 operating income by approximately two percent in both the Diversified Industrial North American and Diversified Industrial International operations. In 2020, the Company expects to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment. These actions are expected to result in approximately $20 million in charges in 2020.The Company anticipates Diversified Industrial North American sales for 2020 will range between a decrease of 2.8 percent and an increase of 0.2 percent from the 2019 level and Diversified Industrial International sales for 2020 will decrease between 6.2 percent and 3.2 percent from the 2019 level. Diversified Industrial North American operating margins in 2020 are expected to range from 16.8 percent to 17.2 percent and Diversified Industrial International margins are expected to range from 15.4 percent to 15.9 percent.The decrease in total Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2019 was primarily due to shipments exceeding orders in both the North American and International businesses, with each business accounting for 50 percent of the change. Within the Diversified Industrial International business, the decrease in backlog was split evenly between Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. Aerospace Systems Segment (dollars in millions) 2019 2018Sales $2,511 $2,316Operating income 488 398Operating income as a percent of sales 19.4% 17.2%Backlog $2,209 $1,954Sales in 2019 were higher than the 2018 level primarily due to higher volume in the commercial and military aftermarket businesses as well as in the commercial and military original equipment manufacturer (OEM) businesses. The higher margin in 2019 was primarily due to a favorable product mix resulting from higher aftermarket and OEM volume and profitability, higher joint venture earnings, lower engineering development and the absence of business realignment expenses in the current year.The increase in backlog in 2019 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the military OEM and aftermarket businesses and in the commercial aftermarket business, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the commercial OEM business. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. For 2020, sales are expected to increase between 3.0 percent and 5.6 percent from the 2019 level and operating margins are expected to range from 20.4 percent to 21.0 percent. A higher concentration of commercial OEM volume in future product mix and higher than expected new product development costs could result in lower margins.23Table of ContentsCorporate general and administrative expenses were $195 million in 2019 compared to $201 million in 2018. As a percent of sales, corporate general and administrative expenses in both 2019 and 2018 were 1.4 percent. The lower expense in 2019 is primarily due to lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher net expense associated with the Company's deferred compensation program and related investments.Other expense (in the Business Segment Information) (dollars in millions) Expense (income)2019 2018Foreign currency transaction$6 $7Stock-based compensation52 51Pensions20 26Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns, net11 (4)Sale and writedown of investments— 41Acquisition expenses17 5Other items, net7 (4) $113 $122Foreign currency transaction primarily relates to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash, marketable securities and other investments and intercompany transactions. Divestitures and asset sales and writedowns in 2018 includes a net gain on the sale of assets, partially offset by a loss on the sale of the global Facet filtration business. The acquisition expenses incurred in 2019 primarily relate to the proposed acquisition of Lord.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETThe Consolidated Balance Sheet shows the Company's financial position at year end, compared with the previous year end. This discussion provides information to assist in assessing factors such as the Company's liquidity and financial resources.

As a result of the TCJ Act, the prior worldwide tax system was replaced by a territorial tax system, which generally allows companies to repatriate future foreign source earnings without incurring additional U.S. federal taxes. However, other U.S. or foreign taxes may be incurred should cash be distributed between the Company's subsidiaries. The Company has determined it will no longer permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings. All other undistributed foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Trade accounts receivable, net are receivables due from customers for sales of product. Days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the Company was 53 days in 2019 and 51 days in 2018. The Company believes that its receivables are collectible and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts have been recorded. 24Table of ContentsInventories increased $57 million from 2018 primarily due to a $59 million increase in inventories in the Aerospace Systems Segment and an increase of $12 million in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by a decrease of $15 million related to the effect of foreign currency translation. Within the Diversified Industrial Segment, an increase in inventories in the North American operations was partially offset by a decrease in the International operations. Days supply of inventory on hand was 69 days in 2019 and 64 days in 2018.Long-term debt increased $2,202 million from 2018 primarily due to issuance of new debt related to the proposed acquisition of Lord. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Shareholders' equity activity during 2019 included a decrease of $800 million related to share repurchases, a decrease of $228 million related to pensions and postretirement benefits resulting from net actuarial losses due to a decrease in discount rates and a decrease of $66 million related to foreign currency translation adjustments. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWSThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects cash inflows and outflows from the Company's operating, investing and financing activities.A summary of cash flows follows:(dollars in millions) 2019 2018Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $1,730 $1,597Investing activities (219) 24Financing activities 902 (1,682)Effect of exchange rates (16) (1)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $2,397 $(62)Cash flows from operating activities in 2019 reflects an increase in net income of $452 million and an increase of $144 million from cash provided by working capital items.

It also includes $195 million and $248 million of capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2018 cash flows from investing activities benefited from proceeds related to the sale of the global Facet filtration business.Cash flows from financing activities includes issuance of long-term debt of $2,337 million in 2019 primarily related to the proposed acquisition of Lord. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Cash flows from financing activities during 2018 included the repayment of long-term debt of approximately $945 million. The Company repurchased 4.8 million common shares for $800 million during 2019 compared to the repurchase of 1.7 million common shares for $300 million in 2018.Dividends have been paid for 276 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 63 years. The current annual dividend rate is $3.52 per common share.The Company's goal is to maintain a strong investment-grade credit profile. At June 30, 2019, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows: Fitch Ratings A-Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Baa1Standard & Poor's A25Table of ContentsThe rating agencies periodically update the Company's credit ratings as events occur. On July 29, 2019, Standard & Poor's downgraded the Company's credit rating to A- reflecting the additional debt that will be used to fund the recently announced acquisitions.As of June 30, 2019, the Company had a line of credit totaling $2,000 million through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, of which $1,414 million was available at June 30, 2019. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.The Company is currently authorized to sell up to $2,000 million of short-term commercial paper notes. There were $586 million outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2019, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the last quarter of 2019 was $1,000 million.The Company's credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt agreements contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the applicable agreements for future borrowings or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the applicable agreements. The Company is in compliance with all covenants and expects to remain in compliance during the term of the credit agreements and indentures.During 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement under which it expects to acquire Lord for approximately $3,675 million in cash. The Company intends to finance the purchase price for the Lord acquisition with the net proceeds from the Senior Notes due 2024, 2029 and 2049, the delayed-draw term loan and certain commercial paper proceeds. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. On July 29, 2019, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Exotic for approximately $1,725 million in cash and intends to finance the purchase price for this acquisition with new debt. These acquisitions remain subject to certain closing conditions.Contractual Obligations - The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was $166 million at June 30, 2019. Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the Company's fixed contractual obligations.

The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.26Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations, which are distinct goods or services within the contract, is transferred to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. A majority of the Company’s revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. However, a portion of the Company’s revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as the Company performs work under a contract, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and the Company has a contractual right to payment.For contracts where revenue is recognized over time, the Company uses the cost-to-cost, efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract, including length of production time. The estimation of these costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. Adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. Revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer.The Company considers the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and the Company’s best judgment at the time.Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - Goodwill is tested for impairment, at the reporting unit level, on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. For the Company, reporting units are equivalent to its operating segments. As quoted market prices are not available for the reporting units, determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which was estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based valuation method utilized a discounted cash flow model, which required several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry-specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. Within the discounted cash flow models, the Company also used a discount rate, commensurate with its cost of capital, but adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. The market-based valuation method included an analysis, for each reporting unit, consisting of market-adjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies. The Company also reconciled the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units resulting from these procedures to its overall market capitalization.The results of the Company's 2019 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of December 31, 2018 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed. The Company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate. The Company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units. If actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible that the Company may need to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests, and the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value. Long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. During 2019, the Company did not record any material impairment related to long-lived assets. 27Table of ContentsPensions - The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. For the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a $15 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $23 million. As of June 30, 2019, $1,064 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. These losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. Any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization. Further information on pensions is provided in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income Taxes - Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Loss Contingencies - The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. These loss accruals are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and the Company does not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gains or losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Gains or losses on derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt existing at June 30, 2019 by approximately $9 million.28Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:47:56.404945

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. All statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments are forward-looking statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the Company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the Company's ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. Additionally, the actual impact of changes in tax laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions and any judicial or regulatory interpretations thereof on future performance and earnings projections may impact the Company's tax calculations. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.Among other factors which may affect future performance are:•global economic and political factors, including the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19 and governmental and other actions taken in response, manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates and monetary policy, trade policy and tariffs, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability, as well as uncertainties associated with the timing and conditions surrounding the return to service of the Boeing 737 MAX;•our ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions, including the integrations of Clarcor, Lord and EMFCO Holdings Incorporated, parent company of Exotic; and our ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures;•our ability to effectively manage expanded operations from the acquisitions of Clarcor, Lord and Exotic;•the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities;•increased cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crime; •business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments;•the development of new products and technologies requiring substantial investment;•availability, limitations or cost increases of raw materials, component products and/or commodities that cannot be recovered in product pricing; •disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs, and changes in product mix;•uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal and regulatory proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals; •additional liabilities relating to changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities;•potential product liability risks;•our ability to enter into, own, renew and maintain intellectual property and know-how;•our leverage and future debt service obligations;•potential impairment of goodwill;•compliance costs associated with environmental laws and climate change regulations; •our ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits;•compliance with federal rules, regulations, audits and investigations associated with being a provider of products to the United States government; and •our ability to implement successfully the Company's capital allocation initiatives, including timing, price and execution of share repurchases.The Company makes these statements as of the date of the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law.17Table of ContentsOverviewThe Company is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.Our order rates provide a near-term perspective of the Company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders. We believe the leading economic indicators of these markets that have a correlation to the Company's future order rates are as follows:•Purchasing Managers Index (""PMI"") on manufacturing activity specific to regions around the world with respect to most mobile and industrial markets;•Global aircraft miles flown and global revenue passenger miles for commercial aerospace markets and Department of Defense spending for military aerospace markets; and•Housing starts with respect to the North American residential air conditioning market and certain mobile construction markets.A PMI above 50 indicates that the manufacturing activity specific to a region of the world in the mobile and industrial markets is expanding. A PMI below 50 indicates the opposite. Recent PMI levels for some regions around the world were as follows: June 30, 2020 March 31, 2020 June 30, 2019United States52.6 49.1 50.6Eurozone countries47.4 44.5 47.6China51.2 50.1 49.4Brazil51.6 48.4 51.0 Global aircraft miles flown decreased by approximately 45 percent and global revenue passenger miles decreased by approximately 52 percent from their comparable 2019 levels. The Company anticipates that U.S. Department of Defense spending with regard to appropriations and operations and maintenance for the U.S. Government's fiscal year 2020 will increase by approximately two percent from its fiscal 2019 level.Housing starts in June 2020 were approximately two percent lower than housing starts in March 2020 and approximately four percent lower than housing starts in June 2019.During 2020, the World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak COVID-19 a pandemic. Given the unpredictable nature of COVID-19's impact on the global economy, the statistics included above may not be reflective of recent or future activity.We are actively monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, our business and results of operations. Disruption within the aerospace industry, which is facing the consequences of travel restrictions and considerably lower demand, was significant and is expected to continue. The ultimate extent to which our business and results of operations will be impacted by the outbreak will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or mitigate its economic, public health and other impacts. We took immediate and aggressive action to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces and are taking measures to preserve cash and reduce costs, including but not limited to, global salary reductions, reduced work schedules, elimination of discretionary spending, targeted restructuring and limiting capital expenditures to safety-related issues and strategic investments. At the same time, we are appropriately addressing the ongoing needs of our business so that we may continue to serve our customers.In the long-term, we believe many opportunities for profitable growth are available. The Company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation. 18Table of ContentsWe believe we can meet our strategic objectives by:•Serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the Company;•Successfully executing The Win Strategy initiatives relating to engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance;•Maintaining a decentralized division and sales company structure;•Fostering a safety first and entrepreneurial culture;•Engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;•Delivering products, systems and services that have demonstrable savings to customers and are priced by the value they deliver; •Acquiring strategic businesses; •Organizing around targeted regions, technologies and markets;•Driving efficiency by implementing lean enterprise principles; and •Creating a culture of empowerment through our values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.Acquisitions will be considered from time to time to the extent there is a strong strategic fit, while at the same time maintaining the Company’s strong financial position. During 2020, the Company completed the Lord and Exotic acquisitions, which are further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We continue to assess our existing businesses and may initiate efforts to divest businesses that are not considered to be a good long-term strategic fit for the Company. Future business divestitures could have a negative effect on the Company’s results of operations. The discussion below is structured to separately discuss the financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term ""year"" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year. Discussion of the 2018 financial statements is included in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOMEThe Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance. The discussion below compares the operating performance in 2020 and 2019.(dollars in millions) 2020 2019Net sales $13,696 $14,320Gross profit margin 24.9% 25.3%Selling, general and administrative expenses $1,657 $1,544Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales 12.1% 10.8%Interest expense $308 $190Other (income) expense, net (67) (61)(Gain) loss on disposal of assets (1) 11Effective tax rate 20.2% 21.7%Net income attributable to common shareholders $1,206 $1,512Net sales in 2020 decreased from the 2019 amount due to lower volume in all segments, partially offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions made within the last 12 months of $949 million. The effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2020 by approximately $167 million, of which $152 million was attributable to the Diversified Industrial International operations.19Table of ContentsGross profit margin (calculated as net sales less cost of sales, divided by net sales) decreased slightly in 2020. Lower volume and current-year acquisition-related expenses of $69 million were partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from current and prior-year business realignment, acquisition integration and simplification activities, lower raw material costs and favorable product mix. Additionally, cost of sales included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $60 million in 2020 compared to $15 million in 2019. Gross profit margin in 2020 benefited from a foreign currency transaction gain of $10 million compared to a loss of $6 million in 2019.Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") increased seven percent in 2020 primarily due to acquisition-related transaction costs of $119 million in the current year compared to $17 million in 2019 and higher intangible asset amortization expense related to the Lord and Exotic acquisitions. SG&A also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $38 million and $13 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. These expenses were partially offset by a net benefit associated with the Company's deferred compensation plan and related investments. Additionally, SG&A benefited from lower discretionary spending and wage and salary expense as a result of actions taken in response to the current business conditions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak.Interest expense in 2020 increased due to a higher average interest rate and higher average debt outstanding. Other (income) expense, net included the following:(dollars in millions) Expense (income) 2020 2019Income related to equity method investments $(75) $(93)Non-service components of retirement benefit cost 49 40Interest income (31) (18)Other items, net (10) 10 $(67) $(61)(Gain) loss on disposal of assets in 2020 and 2019 includes gains on the sale of real estate of $12 million and $11 million, respectively, with the remainder relating to net losses on divestitures and asset sales and writedowns.Effective tax rate in 2020 was lower than 2019 primarily due to favorable one-time adjustments that were recorded in the current year as a result of a favorable foreign audit settlement.BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Business Segment information presents sales and operating income on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making.Diversified Industrial Segment(dollars in millions) 2020 2019Sales North America $6,456 $6,809International 4,505 5,001Operating income North America 986 1,139International 675 805Operating income as a percent of sales North America 15.3% 16.7%International 15.0% 16.1%Backlog $2,117 $2,01120Table of ContentsThe Diversified Industrial Segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales: 2020Diversified Industrial North America – as reported (5.2)%Acquisitions 6.0 %Currency (0.2)%Diversified Industrial North America – without acquisitions and currency (11.0)% Diversified Industrial International – as reported (9.9)%Acquisitions 4.1 %Currency (3.1)%Diversified Industrial International – without acquisitions and currency (10.9)% Total Diversified Industrial Segment – as reported (7.2)%Acquisitions 5.2 %Currency (1.4)%Total Diversified Industrial Segment – without acquisitions and currency (11.0)%The above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the Diversified Industrial Segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions made within the prior four fiscal quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates (a non-GAAP measure). The effects of acquisitions and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period.Sales in 2020 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations decreased 5.2 percent from 2019. Acquisitions increased sales by $408 million, and the effect of currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately $13 million. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2020 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations decreased 11.0 percent from prior-year levels reflecting lower demand from distributors and end users in virtually all markets, including the construction equipment, cars and light truck, heavy-duty truck, engines, refrigeration and general industrial machinery markets. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in end-user demand in the life sciences market. Sales in the Diversified Industrial International operations decreased 9.9 percent in 2020. Acquisitions increased sales by approximately $203 million in 2020. The effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by $152 million, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the Eurozone countries, China, Brazil, and South Korea. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2020 for the Diversified Industrial International operations decreased 10.9 percent from 2019 levels primarily due to lower demand from distributors and end users in both the mobile and industrial markets. During 2020, Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Latin America accounted for approximately 68 percent, 28 percent, and four percent, respectively, of the decrease in sales.Within Europe, the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, general industrial machinery, machine tool, heavy-duty truck and cars and light truck markets. Within the Asia Pacific region, the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower demand from distributors as well as end users in the construction equipment, railroad equipment, telecommunications and machine tool markets. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in end-user demand in the semiconductor, mining and engine markets. The decrease in sales in Latin America was primarily due to lower demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, farm and agricultural equipment and cars and light truck markets, partially offset by an increase in end-user demand in the oil and gas market.Operating margins in 2020 decreased in both the Diversified Industrial North American and International operations primarily due to lower sales volume, acquisition-related expenses, higher intangible asset amortization expense, and higher business realignment and acquisition integration costs. These costs were partially offset by lower discretionary spending, lower wage and salary expense, favorable product mix, lower raw material costs, benefits from current-year and prior-year business realignment and simplification actions, and prior-year pricing actions.21Table of ContentsThe following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income:(dollars in millions) 2020 2019Diversified Industrial North America $41 $13Diversified Industrial International 32 15The business realignment charges consist primarily of severance and plant closure costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, which is being implemented by its operating units throughout the world. Current-year acquisition integration charges relate to the Lord acquisition. Prior-year acquisition integration charges relate to the 2017 acquisition of Clarcor. During 2020, business realignment charges also include permanent workforce reductions to address the impact of COVID-19 on our business. The majority of the Diversified Industrial International business realignment and acquisition integration charges were incurred in Europe. We anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2020 will increase operating income for 2021 by approximately five percent in the Diversified Industrial North American operations and by approximately two percent in the Diversified Industrial International operations. In 2021, we expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment. These actions are expected to result in approximately $53 million in business realignment charges in 2021. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur.The increase in Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2020 was primarily due to the current-year acquisition of Lord, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in both the North American and International businesses. Within the International business, this decrease in backlog was primarily related to shipments exceeding orders in both Europe and Latin America, partially offset by orders exceeding shipments in the Asia Pacific region. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. Aerospace Systems Segment (dollars in millions) 2020 2019Sales $2,735 $2,511Operating income 477 488Operating income as a percent of sales 17.4% 19.4%Backlog $3,021 $2,209Sales in 2020 were higher than the 2019 level primarily due to $338 million of sales from current-year acquisitions and higher volume in the military OEM and aftermarket businesses, partially offset by lower volume in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses.Operating margin decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower sales volume in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses, unfavorable product mix, acquisition-related expenses, higher intangible asset amortization expense and current-year business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $24 million. The halt in production of the Boeing 737 MAX also contributed to lower operating margin during 2020. These expenses were partially offset by lower engineering development expenses, lower discretionary spending and savings from the current-year business realignment and acquisition integration actions.As a result of the disruption in the aerospace industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to continue to take the actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Aerospace Systems Segment. These actions are expected to result in approximately $12 million of business realignment charges in 2021. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur. We anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2020 will increase operating income for 2021 by approximately 13 percent. 22Table of ContentsThe increase in backlog in 2020 was primarily due to the addition of Exotic backlog in the current year and orders exceeding shipments in the military OEM and aftermarket businesses, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.

This discussion provides information to assist in assessing factors such as the Company's liquidity and financial resources. (dollars in millions) 2020 2019Cash $756 $3,371Trade accounts receivable, net 1,854 2,131Inventories 1,815 1,678Intangible assets, net 3,799 1,783Goodwill 7,870 5,454Notes payable and long-term debt payable within one year 810 587Long-term debt 7,652 6,521Shareholders' equity 6,114 5,962Working capital $1,737 $4,521Current ratio 1.6 2.423Table of ContentsCash (comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments) includes $726 million and $975 million held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has determined it will no longer permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings. The distribution of these earnings could result in non-federal U.S. or foreign taxes. All other undistributed foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Trade accounts receivable, net are receivables due from customers for sales of product. Days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the Company was 54 days in 2020 and 53 days in 2019. We believe that our receivables are collectible and appropriate allowances for doubtful accounts have been recorded. Inventories as of June 30, 2020 increased by $136 million (which includes an increase of $363 million from acquisitions and a decrease of $26 million from the effect of foreign currency translation). After consideration of the effects of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, inventories decreased primarily due to a decrease in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by an increase in the Aerospace Systems Segment. Days supply of inventory on hand was 89 days in 2020 and 69 days in 2019.Intangible assets, net and Goodwill increased from 2019 primarily due to the current-year acquisitions of Lord and Exotic. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Notes payable and long-term debt payable within one year increased from 2019 primarily due to higher commercial paper notes outstanding of which a portion was used to finance the purchase of the Lord and Exotic acquisitions. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Long-term debt increased from 2019 primarily due to outstanding term loans related to the acquisition of Lord and Exotic. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Shareholders' equity activity during 2020 included a decrease of $147 million related to share repurchases, a decrease of $318 million related to pensions and postretirement benefits resulting from net actuarial losses due to a decrease in discount rates and a decrease of $182 million related to foreign currency translation adjustments. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWSThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects cash inflows and outflows from the Company's operating, investing and financing activities.A summary of cash flows follows:(dollars in millions) 2020 2019Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $2,071 $1,730Investing activities (5,024) (219)Financing activities 449 902Effect of exchange rates (30) (16)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(2,534) $2,397Cash flows from operating activities in 2020 reflects a decrease in net income of $306 million and an increase of $327 million from cash provided by working capital items. The Company also made a discretionary cash contribution to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan of $200 million in 2019.Cash flows from investing activities in 2020 includes $5,076 million of acquisition-related activity for Lord and Exotic. It also includes $121 million of proceeds from the redemption of company-owned life insurance investments associated with the Company's deferred compensation programs as well proceeds of $44 million related to the settlement of a cross currency swap.24Table of ContentsCash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from the $925 million and $800 million term loans related to the acquisition of Exotic and Lord, respectively. It also includes repayment of long-term debt of approximately $740 million, of which approximately $221 million relates to acquired Lord debt. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. The Company repurchased 0.8 million common shares for $147 million during 2020 compared to the repurchase of 4.8 million common shares for $800 million in 2019.Dividends have been paid for 280 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 64 years. The current annual dividend rate is $3.52 per common share.Our goal is to maintain a strong investment-grade credit profile. The rating agencies periodically update our credit ratings as events occur. At June 30, 2020, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows: Fitch Ratings BBB+Moody's Investor Services, Inc. Baa1Standard & Poor's BBB+During 2020, we have taken several meaningful measures to strengthen our liquidity position in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including limiting capital expenditures to safety-related issues and strategic investments, the suspension of our share repurchase program and other cost reduction efforts. Although we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or its impact on our business, we believe these measures, as well as access to committed credit under our credit agreement, position the Company well to manage through the current economic uncertainty and capitalize on our position as the global leader in motion and control technologies as the economy recovers.During 2020, the Company amended and extended its existing multi-currency credit agreement, increasing its capacity to $2,500 million. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had $1,777 million available for borrowing under the credit agreement. The credit agreement expires in September 2024; however, the Company has the right to request a one-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement. Advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness. The credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which is dependent upon the Company’s credit ratings. Although a lowering of the Company’s credit ratings would increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit the Company’s ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.The Company is currently authorized to sell up to $2,500 million of short-term commercial paper notes. There were $724 million outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2020, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the last quarter of 2020 was $1,089 million.The Company’s credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt securities contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. Based on the Company’s rating level at June 30, 2020, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. At June 30, 2020, the Company's debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.58 to 1.0. We are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures.25Table of ContentsContractual Obligations - The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was $101 million at June 30, 2020. Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the Company's fixed contractual obligations.

The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.Revenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations, which are distinct goods or services within the contract, is transferred to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. A majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. However, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment.For contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we use the cost-to-cost, efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract, including length of production time. The estimation of these costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. Adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. Revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer.We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Our six reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which is 26Table of Contentsestimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions, including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry-specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. Within the discounted cash flow models, the Company uses a discount rate, commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. The market-based valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of market-adjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies. We also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization.At December 31, 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its six reporting units. The results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. We continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate. We did not identify any events or circumstances during 2020 that required performance of an interim impairment test. However, the effects of COVID-19 on the global economy, including further market disruption, lack of economic recovery or lower than anticipated customer demand, may require the performance of additional goodwill impairment tests, and the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value. Long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. During 2020, the Company did not record any material impairment related to long-lived assets. Pensions - The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. For the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a $17 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $28 million. As of June 30, 2020, $1,456 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. These losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. Any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization. Further information on pensions is provided in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income Taxes - Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Loss Contingencies - The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. We review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.27Table of ContentsRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For cross-currency swaps measured using the spot method, the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense. The translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt existing at June 30, 2020 by approximately $24 million.As discussed elsewhere in this report, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively impacted and we expect it to continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations. As we cannot predict the ultimate duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material.28Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:47:55.001647

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. Often but not always, these statements may be identified from the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “potential,” “continues,” “plans,” “forecasts,” “estimates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “would,” “intends,” “expects,” “targets,” “is likely,” “will,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, and include all statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments. Neither the Company nor any of its respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this document will actually occur. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the Company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from past performance or current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the Company’s ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. Additionally, the actual impact of changes in tax laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions and any judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof on future performance and earnings projections may impact the Company’s tax calculations. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.Among other factors which may affect future performance are: •the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19 and governmental and other actions taken in response; •changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments; •disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs and changes in product mix;•ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions, including the integration of Lord and Exotic and the proposed acquisition of Meggitt; and our ability to effectively manage expanded operations from the acquisitions of Lord and Exotic and the proposed acquisition of Meggitt; •the ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures;•the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities;•ability to implement successfully capital allocation initiatives, including timing, price and execution of share repurchases;•availability, limitations or cost increases of raw materials, component products and/or commodities that cannot be recovered in product pricing;•ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits;•legal and regulatory developments and changes;•additional liabilities relating to changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities; •ability to enter into, own, renew, protect and maintain intellectual property and know-how; •leverage and future debt service obligations; •potential impairment of goodwill; •compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations;•potential labor disruptions;•uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals;•global competitive market conditions, including U.S. trade policies and resulting effects on sales and pricing;•global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates, credit availability and changes in consumer habits and preferences;•local and global political and economic conditions;21Table of Contents•inability to obtain, or meet conditions imposed for, required governmental and regulatory approvals;•government actions and natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and pandemics;•increased cyber security threats and sophisticated computer crime; and•success of business and operating initiatives.

For more than a century, the Company has engineered the success of its customers in a wide range of diversified industrial and aerospace markets.By aligning around our purpose, Enabling Engineering Breakthroughs that Lead to a Better Tomorrow, Parker is better positioned for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow.The Win Strategy 3.0 is Parker's business system that defines the goals and initiatives that drive growth, transformation and success. It works with our purpose, which is a foundational element of The Win Strategy, to engage team members and create responsible and sustainable growth. Our shared values shape our culture and our interactions with stakeholders and the communities in which we operate and live.We believe many opportunities for profitable growth are available. The Company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation. We believe we can meet our strategic objectives by:•Serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the Company;•Successfully executing The Win Strategy initiatives relating to engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance;•Maintaining a decentralized division and sales company structure;•Fostering a safety-first and entrepreneurial culture;•Engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;•Delivering products, systems and services that have demonstrable savings to customers and are priced by the value they deliver;•Enabling a sustainable future by providing innovative technology solutions that offer a positive, global environmental impact and operating responsibly by reducing our energy use and emissions;•Acquiring strategic businesses;•Organizing around targeted regions, technologies and markets; •Driving efficiency by implementing lean enterprise principles; and •Creating a culture of empowerment through our values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.Our order rates provide a near-term perspective of the Company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has negatively impacted demand and continues to create economic uncertainty. Disruption within the aerospace industry, which is facing the consequences of travel restrictions and considerably lower demand, was significant and is expected to continue. The extent to which our business and results of operations will be impacted by the pandemic over the long term will depend on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time. These developments include the availability, acceptance, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines; new information concerning the severity and spread of COVID-19 and its variants; and actions by government authorities to contain the pandemic or mitigate its economic, public health and other impacts. We continue to prioritize the safety of our team members. To minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces, we implemented rigorous prevention, screening and hygiene protocols. Additionally, we are strategically managing costs through reductions in discretionary spending. We continue to prioritize capital expenditures related to safety and strategic investments. 22Table of ContentsAt the same time, we are appropriately addressing the ongoing needs of our business so that we may continue to serve our customers.The discussion below is structured to separately discuss the financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The term ""year"" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year. Discussion of the 2019 financial statements is included in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOMEThe Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance. The discussion below compares the operating performance in 2021 and 2020.(dollars in millions)20212020*Net sales$14,348 $13,696 Gross profit margin27.2 %24.8 %Selling, general and administrative expenses$1,527 $1,657 Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales10.6 %12.1 %Interest expense$250 $308 Other (income), net(17)(67)Gain on disposal of assets(109)(1)Effective tax rate22.3 %20.2 %Net income attributable to common shareholders$1,746 $1,202 *Year ended June 30, 2020 amounts have been adjusted to reflect the change in inventory accounting method, as described in Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Net sales in 2021 increased from the 2020 amount due to higher volume in both the Diversified Industrial International and Diversified Industrial North American businesses, partially offset by lower volume in the Aerospace Systems Segment. The effect of currency rate changes increased net sales in 2021 by approximately $257 million, of which $244 million was attributable to the Diversified Industrial International operations. Prior-year acquisitions contributed approximately $394 million in net sales during 2021.Gross profit margin (calculated as net sales less cost of sales, divided by net sales) increased in 2021 primarily due to higher margins in all businesses. Gross profit margin in 2021 included net foreign currency transaction gains of $11 million and $10 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross profit margin also benefited from the absence of acquisition-related expenses, which were included in cost of sales in 2020, of $69 million. Cost of sales included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $35 million in 2021 compared to $60 million in 2020.Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") decreased eight percent in 2021 primarily due to benefits from lower discretionary spending and wage and salary expense resulting from actions taken in response to business conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. During 2021, SG&A also benefited from the absence of acquisition-related expenses of $119 million, which were incurred in 2020. These benefits were partially offset by higher intangible asset amortization expense related to prior-year acquisitions and higher stock compensation expense. SG&A also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $23 million and $38 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Interest expense in 2021 decreased due to both lower interest rates and lower average debt outstanding. Other (income), net included the following:(dollars in millions)20212020Expense (income)Income related to equity method investments$(41)$(75)Non-service components of retirement benefit cost49 49 Interest income(7)(31)Other items, net(18)(10)$(17)$(67)23Table of ContentsGain on disposal of assets in 2021 primarily consists of a gain of $101 million on the sale of land. In 2020, it includes gains of $12 million on the sale of real estate, partially offset by net losses on divestitures and asset sales and writedowns.Effective tax rate in 2021 was higher than 2020 primarily due to an overall decrease in discrete tax benefits.BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Business Segment information presents sales and operating income on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making.Diversified Industrial Segment(dollars in millions)20212020Net SalesNorth America$6,676 $6,456 International5,284 4,505 Operating incomeNorth America1,247 986 International988 675 Operating income as a percent of salesNorth America18.7 %15.3 %International18.7 %15.0 %Backlog$3,239 $2,117 The Diversified Industrial Segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales: 2021Diversified Industrial North America – as reported3.4 %Acquisitions2.9 %Currency0.1 %Diversified Industrial North America – without acquisitions and currency0.4 %Diversified Industrial International – as reported17.3 %Acquisitions3.0 %Currency5.4 %Diversified Industrial International – without acquisitions and currency8.9 %Total Diversified Industrial Segment – as reported9.1 %Acquisitions2.9 %Currency2.3 %Total Diversified Industrial Segment – without acquisitions and currency3.9 %The above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the Diversified Industrial Segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of acquisitions made within the prior four fiscal quarters as well as the effects of currency exchange rates (a non-GAAP measure). The effects of acquisitions and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period.Sales in 2021 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 3.4 percent from 2020. Acquisitions increased sales by $188 million, and the effect of currency exchange rates increased sales by approximately $8 million. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2021 for the Diversified Industrial North American operations increased 0.4 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users in the refrigeration, cars and light truck, farm and agriculture and life sciences markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the oil and gas and general industrial machinery markets. 24Table of ContentsSales in the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 17.3 percent in 2021. Acquisitions increased sales by approximately $136 million in 2021. The effect of currency rate changes increased sales by $244 million, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the Eurozone countries, China and the United Kingdom. Excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2021 for the Diversified Industrial International operations increased 8.9 percent from 2020 levels primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in both the mobile and industrial markets. During 2021, the Asia Pacific region, Europe, and Latin America accounted for approximately 60 percent, 26 percent, and 14 percent, respectively, of the increase in sales.Within the Asia Pacific region, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, semiconductor, cars and light truck, general industrial machinery, engine and life sciences markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the oil and gas market.Within Europe, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, heavy-duty truck and power generation markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the general industrial machinery, oil and gas and marine markets. Within Latin America, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the farm and agriculture, construction equipment, cars and light truck and heavy-duty truck markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the oil and gas market.Operating margins in 2021 increased in both the Diversified Industrial North American and International operations primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from overall cost reductions, including lower discretionary spending, wage and salary reductions, current and prior-year restructuring actions in response to business conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the absence of acquisition-related expenses, and productivity improvements. The following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income:(dollars in millions)20212020Diversified Industrial North America$14 $41 Diversified Industrial International36 32 During 2021, business realignment charges primarily include actions taken to address the impact of COVID-19 on our business, but also include charges related to the Company’s simplification initiative. The simplification initiative is aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity and is being implemented by operating units around the world. During 2020, business realignment charges primarily include charges related to the Company’s simplification initiative, but also include permanent workforce reductions to address the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Acquisition integration charges relate to the 2020 acquisition of Lord. The majority of the Diversified Industrial International business realignment and acquisition integration charges were incurred in Europe. We anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2021 will increase operating income for 2022 by approximately one percent in both the Diversified Industrial North American and International operations. In 2022, we expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment. These actions are expected to result in approximately $40 million in business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2022. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur.The increase in Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2021 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in both the North American and International businesses, with each business accounting for approximately 50 percent of the change. Within the International business, this increase in backlog was primarily related to orders exceeding shipments in both Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. 25Table of ContentsAerospace Systems Segment (dollars in millions)20212020Sales$2,388 $2,735 Operating income403 477 Operating income as a percent of sales16.9 %17.4 %Backlog$3,264 $3,021 Sales in 2021 were lower than the 2020 level primarily due to lower volume in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses due to the market conditions as a result of COVID-19. This decrease was partially offset by higher volume in the military OEM and aftermarket businesses as well as a $71 million increase in sales from prior-year acquisitions.Operating margin decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower sales volume in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses and lower aftermarket profitability. Lower sales volume and aftermarket profitability were partially offset by lower engineering development expenses, overall cost reductions, lower business realignment and acquisition integration charges and the benefits from such actions.The disruption in the aerospace industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been significant and we have taken actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Aerospace Systems Segment. We do not currently intend to incur significant additional business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2022. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur. We anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2021 will increase segment operating income for 2022 by approximately two percent. The increase in backlog in 2021 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the military OEM business, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the military aftermarket and commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer.

Days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the Company was 50 days in 2021 and 54 days in 2020. We believe that our receivables are collectible and appropriate allowances for credit losses have been recorded. Inventories as of June 30, 2021 increased by $127 million (which includes an increase of $41 million from the effect of foreign currency translation). After consideration of the effect of foreign currency translation, inventories increased primarily due to an increase in the Diversified Industrial Segment, partially offset by a decrease in the Aerospace Systems Segment. Days supply of inventory on hand was 75 days in 2021 and 89 days in 2020.27Table of ContentsNotes payable and long-term debt payable within one year decreased from 2020 primarily due to the repayment of commercial paper notes outstanding. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Long-term debt decreased from 2020 primarily due to the repayment of term loans. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Shareholders' equity activity during 2021 included a decrease of $100 million related to share repurchases, an increase of $664 million related to pensions and postretirement benefits resulting from investment gains on plan assets and an increase of $328 million related to foreign currency translation adjustments. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWSThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows reflects cash inflows and outflows from the Company's operating, investing and financing activities.A summary of cash flows follows:(dollars in millions)20212020Cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$2,575 $2,071 Investing activities— (5,024)Financing activities(2,623)449 Effect of exchange rates96 (30)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$48 $(2,534)Cash flows from operating activities in 2021 reflects an increase in net income of $545 million and an increase of $12 million from cash provided by working capital items. We remain focused on managing our inventory and other working capital requirements.Cash flows from investing activities in 2021 includes net proceeds from the sale of land of approximately $111 million. Cash flows from investing activities in 2020 includes $5,076 million of acquisition-related activity. It also includes $121 million of proceeds from the redemption of company-owned life insurance investments associated with the Company's deferred compensation programs as well as proceeds of $44 million related to the settlement of a cross-currency swap.Cash flows from financing activities in 2021 includes net commercial paper repayments of $723 million and term loan repayments of $1,210 million. Cash flows from financing activities in 2020 includes proceeds from the issuance of the $925 million and $800 million term loans and the repayment of approximately $740 million of long-term debt. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. The Company repurchased 0.3 million common shares for $100 million during 2021 compared to the repurchase of 0.8 million common shares for $147 million in 2020.Dividends have been paid for 284 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 65 years. The current annual dividend rate is $4.12 per common share.Our goal is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. The rating agencies periodically update our credit ratings as events occur. At June 30, 2021, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows: Fitch RatingsBBB+Moody's Investor Services, Inc.Baa1Standard & Poor'sBBB+28Table of ContentsWe continue to actively monitor our liquidity position and working capital needs and prioritize capital expenditures related to safety and strategic investments. The Company remains in a stable overall capital resources and liquidity position that is adequate to meet its projected needs. In March 2020, the Company suspended the share repurchase program in response to business uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. During February 2021, the Company reinitiated the share repurchase program and repurchased shares totaling $100 million during the remainder of the fiscal year. The Company has a line of credit totaling $2,500 million through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks, all of which was available as of June 30, 2021. The credit agreement expires in September 2024; however, the Company has the right to request a one-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement. Advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness. The credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which is dependent upon the Company’s credit ratings. Although a lowering of the Company’s credit ratings would increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit the Company’s ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.The Company is currently authorized to sell up to $2,500 million of short-term commercial paper notes. There were no outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2021, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the last quarter of 2021 was $203 million.The Company’s credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt securities contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. Based on the Company’s rating level at June 30, 2021, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. At June 30, 2021, the Company's debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.44 to 1.0. We are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures.On August 2, 2021, the Company announced that it reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Meggitt for 800 pence per share, or approximately £6,308 million. We intend to fund the proposed acquisition with cash and new debt. The proposed acquisition remains subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearances and approval by Meggitt’s shareholders.In connection with the proposed acquisition, the Company entered into a bridge credit agreement (the ""Bridge Credit Agreement"") on August 2, 2021. Under the Bridge Credit Agreement, lenders are committed to provide senior, unsecured financing in the aggregate principal amount of £6,524 million. Any borrowings made under the Bridge Credit Agreement would mature 364 days from the initial funding date. The commitments are intended to be drawn to finance the proposed acquisition of Meggitt only to the extent that we do not arrange for alternative financing prior to closing.Contractual Obligations - The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for uncertain tax positions was $119 million at June 30, 2021. Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with worldwide taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of the settlements, these obligations are not included in the following summary of the Company's fixed contractual obligations.

The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.Revenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations, which are distinct goods or services within the contract, is transferred to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. A majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. However, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment.For contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we use the cost-to-cost, efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract, including length of production time. The estimation of costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. Adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. Revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer.We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Our six reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which is estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions, including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry-specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. Within the discounted cash flow models, the Company uses a discount rate, commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. The market-based valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of market-adjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies. We also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization.At December 31, 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its six reporting units. The results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. We continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of a reporting unit's fair value as appropriate. We did not identify any events or circumstances during 2021 that required performance of an interim impairment test.Long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. During 2021, the Company did not record any material impairment related to long-lived assets. 30Table of ContentsPensions - The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. For the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have an $18 million increase in annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $27 million. As of June 30, 2021, $707 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. These losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. Any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization. Further information on pensions is provided in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income Taxes - Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Loss Contingencies - The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. We review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In November 2020, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10890, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information. This rule, which became effective on February 10, 2021, amended certain SEC disclosure requirements in order to modernize, simplify and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, the amendments eliminate the requirement for Selected Financial Data, streamline the requirement to disclose Supplementary Financial Information, and amend Management's Discussion and Analysis. The final rule is applicable for fiscal years ending on or after August 9, 2021, however, early adoption on an Item-by-Item basis is permitted after February 10, 2021. We early adopted the amendments to two items resulting in the elimination of Item 301, Selected Financial Data, from Part II, Item 6 of this report and the omission of Regulation S-K Item 302(a), Supplementary Financial Information, from the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.31Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For cross-currency swaps measured using the spot method, the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense. The translation of the foreign denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. At June 30, 2021, our debt portfolio did not include any variable rate debt. However, a 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on weighted average commercial paper balances during 2021 by approximately $5 million.As discussed elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic is having, and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, and its future impacts remain unpredictable. As we cannot anticipate the ultimate duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material.32Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:47:51.800560

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. Often but not always, these statements may be identified from the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “potential,” “continues,” “plans,” “forecasts,” “estimates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “would,” “intends,” “expects,” “targets,” “is likely,” “will,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, and include all statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments. Neither the Company nor any of its respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this document will actually occur. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the Company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from past performance or current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the Company’s ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. Additionally, the actual impact of changes in tax laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions and any judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof on future performance and earnings projections may impact the Company’s tax calculations. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.Among other factors which may affect future performance are: •changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments; •disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs and changes in product mix;•the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19 and governmental and other actions taken in response; •ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions, including the integration of Lord and Exotic and the proposed acquisition of Meggitt; and our ability to effectively manage expanded operations from the acquisitions of Lord and Exotic and the proposed acquisition of Meggitt; •the ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures;•the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities;•ability to implement successfully capital allocation initiatives, including timing, price and execution of share repurchases;•availability, limitations or cost increases of raw materials, component products and/or commodities that cannot be recovered in product pricing;•ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits;•legal and regulatory developments and changes;•additional liabilities relating to changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities; •ability to enter into, own, renew, protect and maintain intellectual property and know-how; •leverage and future debt service obligations; •potential impairment of goodwill; •compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations;•potential labor disruptions or shortages;•uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals;•global competitive market conditions, including U.S. trade policies and resulting effects on sales and pricing;•global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates, credit availability and changes in consumer habits and preferences;•local and global political and economic conditions, including the Russia-Ukraine war and its residual effects;20Table of Contents•inability to obtain, or meet conditions imposed for, required governmental and regulatory approvals;•government actions and natural phenomena such as pandemics, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural phenomena that may be related to climate change;•increased cyber security threats and sophisticated computer crime; and•success of business and operating initiatives.

For more than a century, the Company has engineered the success of its customers in a wide range of diversified industrial and aerospace markets.By aligning around our purpose, Enabling Engineering Breakthroughs that Lead to a Better Tomorrow, Parker is better positioned for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow.The Win Strategy 3.0 is Parker's business system that defines the goals and initiatives that drive growth, transformation and success. It works with our purpose, which is a foundational element of The Win Strategy, to engage team members and create responsible and sustainable growth. Our shared values shape our culture and our interactions with stakeholders and the communities in which we operate and live.We believe many opportunities for profitable growth are available. The Company intends to focus primarily on business opportunities in the areas of energy, water, food, environment, defense, life sciences, infrastructure and transportation. We believe we can meet our strategic objectives by:•Serving the customer and continuously enhancing its experience with the Company;•Successfully executing The Win Strategy initiatives relating to engaged people, premier customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance;•Maintaining a decentralized division and sales company structure;•Fostering a safety-first and entrepreneurial culture;•Engineering innovative systems and products to provide superior customer value through improved service, efficiency and productivity;•Delivering products, systems and services that have demonstrable savings to customers and are priced by the value they deliver;•Enabling a sustainable future by providing innovative technology solutions that offer a positive, global environmental impact and operating responsibly by reducing our energy use and emissions;•Acquiring strategic businesses;•Organizing around targeted regions, technologies and markets; •Driving efficiency by implementing lean enterprise principles; and •Creating a culture of empowerment through our values, inclusion and diversity, accountability and teamwork.Our order rates provide a near-term perspective of the Company's outlook particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future order rates. The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders.Recent events impacting our business include the Russia-Ukraine war and COVID-19 pandemic and their residual effects, including the inflationary cost environment as well as disruption within the global supply chain, labor markets and aerospace industry. In compliance with international sanctions, we immediately suspended all shipments to and from Russia and, in March 2022, we closed our office and warehouse facility in Moscow. We do not expect our exit of business operations in Russia to materially impact future business, operations or financial results.Despite disruption within the aerospace industry, including ongoing travel restrictions, commercial aerospace demand is beginning to recover. We are managing the challenging supply chain environment through our ""local for local"" manufacturing strategy, ongoing supplier management process, and broadened supply base. We are also managing the inflationary cost environment through a variety of cost and pricing measures, including continuous improvement and lean initiatives. Additionally, we are strategically managing our workforce and discretionary spending. At the same time, we are appropriately addressing the ongoing needs of our business so that we may continue to serve our customers. 21Table of ContentsWe continue to prioritize the safety of our team members. To minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces, we implemented heightened prevention, screening and hygiene protocols. Our actions have varied depending on the spread of COVID-19 in the communities in which we operate, applicable government requirements and the needs of our employees, customers and business.Over the long term, the extent to which our business and results of operations will be impacted by the economic and political uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that remain uncertain. These developments include the duration of the supply chain and labor market constraints, the severity and duration of the Russia-Ukraine war and related sanctions, distribution and continuing effectiveness of vaccines, the severity and spread of COVID-19 and its variants and mitigating actions by government authorities. Additionally, while these events and other global economic factors have led to an increased inflationary environment, we will continue to monitor and manage inflation to minimize its impact on our business, operations, and financial results.As previously announced, on March 14, 2022, we detected that an unauthorized party gained access to our systems. After securing our network and concluding our investigation, we found that the data exfiltrated during the incident included personal information of our team members. We have notified individuals whose personal information was involved and offered them credit monitoring services. We have also provided notification regarding the incident to the appropriate regulatory authorities. A consolidated class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against the Company over the incident. Based on our ongoing assessments, the incident has not had a significant financial or operational impact and has not had a material impact on our business, operations or financial results.The discussion below is structured to separately discuss the Consolidated Statement of Income, Business Segments, and Liquidity and Capital Resources. The term ""year"" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year. Discussion of the 2020 financial statements is included in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOMEThe Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance. The discussion below compares the operating performance in 2022 and 2021.(dollars in millions)20222021Net sales$15,862 $14,348 Gross profit margin28.2 %27.2 %Selling, general and administrative expenses$1,627 $1,527 Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales10.3 %10.6 %Interest expense$255 $250 Other expense (income), net985 (17)Gain on disposal of assets(7)(109)Effective tax rate18.5 %22.3 %Net income attributable to common shareholders$1,316 $1,746 Net sales in 2022 increased from the 2021 amount due to higher volume in both the Diversified Industrial and Aerospace Systems Segments. The effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2022 by approximately $255 million, substantially all of which is attributable to the Diversified Industrial International businesses. Gross profit margin (calculated as net sales less cost of sales, divided by net sales) increased in 2022 primarily due to higher margins in both the Aerospace Systems and Diversified Industrial Segments. The increase in gross profit margin is primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives, as well as price increases, partially offset by increased freight, material and labor costs resulting from the ongoing inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain and labor markets. Cost of sales included net foreign currency transaction gains of $40 million and $11 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cost of sales also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $9 million in 2022 compared to $35 million in 2021.Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") increased in 2022 primarily due to acquisition-related transaction costs of $44 million as well as higher net expense from the Company's deferred compensation plan and related investments and higher professional fees and related expenses. SG&A also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $10 million and $23 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.22Table of ContentsInterest expense in 2022 increased primarily due to higher average debt outstanding, partially offset by lower average interest rates.Other expense (income), net included the following:(dollars in millions)20222021Expense (income)Income related to equity method investments$(76)$(41)Non-service components of retirement benefit cost4 49 Acquisition-related financing fees52 — Loss on deal-contingent forward contracts1,015 — Russia liquidation8 — Other items, net(18)(25)$985 $(17)Acquisition-related financing fees in 2022 relate to the bridge credit agreement (the ""Bridge Credit Agreement"") fees associated with the proposed Acquisition. Refer to Notes 3 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Loss on deal-contingent forward contracts in 2022 includes an unrealized loss on the deal-contingent forward contracts related to the proposed Acquisition. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Gain on disposal of assets in 2021 primarily consists of a gain of $101 million on the sale of land.Effective tax rate in 2022 was lower than 2021 primarily due to an overall increase in discrete tax benefits.BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Business Segment information presents sales and operating income on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making.Diversified Industrial Segment(dollars in millions)20222021Net SalesNorth America$7,703 $6,676 International5,639 5,284 Operating incomeNorth America1,515 1,247 International$1,178 $988 Operating income as a percent of salesNorth America19.7 %18.7 %International20.9 %18.7 %Backlog$4,510 $3,239 23Table of ContentsThe Diversified Industrial Segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales: 2022Diversified Industrial North America – as reported15.4 %Currency0.1 %Diversified Industrial North America – without currency115.3 %Diversified Industrial International – as reported6.7 %Currency(4.9)%Diversified Industrial International – without currency111.6 %Total Diversified Industrial Segment – as reported11.6 %Currency(2.0)%Total Diversified Industrial Segment – without currency113.6 %1The above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the Diversified Industrial Segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of currency exchange rates (a non-GAAP measure). The effects of currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period.Net SalesDiversified Industrial North America - Sales in 2022 for the Diversified Industrial North American businesses increased 15.4 percent from 2021. The effect of currency exchange rates increased sales by approximately $7 million. Excluding the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2022 for the Diversified Industrial North American businesses increased 15.3 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users in virtually all markets, including, the farm and agriculture, life sciences, heavy-duty truck, construction equipment, engines, refrigeration, material handling, metal fabrication, and semiconductor markets.Diversified Industrial International - Sales in the Diversified Industrial International businesses increased 6.7 percent in 2022. The effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by $256 million, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the Eurozone countries, Turkey and Japan. Excluding the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2022 for the Diversified Industrial International businesses increased 11.6 percent from 2021 levels. During 2022, Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Latin America accounted for approximately 70 percent, 20 percent, and 10 percent, respectively, of the increase in sales.Within Europe, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, heavy-duty truck, industrial machinery, life sciences, machine tool, mining, material handling, engines, and forestry markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the cars and light trucks, semiconductor, telecommunications, and oil and gas markets.Within the Asia Pacific region, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the semiconductor, refrigeration, industrial machinery, life sciences, and machine tool markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the engines, power generation, heavy-duty truck, railroad equipment, and material handling markets.Within Latin America, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the farm and agriculture, cars and light trucks, mining, heavy-duty truck, construction equipment, and industrial machinery markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the power generation and life sciences markets.Operating MarginOperating margins in 2022 increased in both the North American and International businesses primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives, as well as price increases. These increases were partially offset by increased operating costs, including higher freight, material, and labor costs resulting from the ongoing disruption within the current supply chain environment and labor market. In addition, within the International businesses, operating margin in 2022 benefited from savings related to prior-year restructuring actions.24Table of ContentsBusiness RealignmentThe following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income:(dollars in millions)20222021Diversified Industrial North America$4 $14 Diversified Industrial International14 36 In both fiscal 2022 and 2021, business realignment charges included severance costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, as well as plant closures. During fiscal 2021, business realignment charges primarily consisted of actions taken to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Acquisition integration charges relate to the 2020 acquisition of Lord. Business realignment and acquisition integration charges within the Diversified Industrial International businesses were primarily incurred in Europe.We anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2022 will increase operating income in 2023 by approximately one percent in the Diversified Industrial International businesses and will not materially impact operating income in the Diversified Industrial North American businesses. In 2023, we expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment. These actions are expected to result in approximately $31 million in business realignment charges in 2023. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur. During 2022, we also incurred $6 million of expense within the Diversified Industrial International businesses as a result of our exit of business operations in Russia. These charges primarily consist of write-downs of inventory and other working capital items.BacklogThe increase in Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2022 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in both the North American and International businesses. Backlog within the North American and International businesses accounted for approximately 75 percent and 25 percent of the change, respectively. Within the International business, the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Latin America accounted for approximately 60 percent, 30 percent, and 10 percent of the change, respectively. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.

These benefits were partially offset by challenges created by the ongoing inflationary environment, disruption within the supply chain and labor markets as well as unfavorable commercial OEM product mix.25Table of ContentsBusiness Realignment During 2022, we incurred $7 million of expense within the Aerospace Systems Segment as a result of our exit of business operations in Russia. These charges primarily consist of write-downs of inventory and other working capital items.We expect to incur approximately $4 million in business realignment charges in 2023. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur. The amount of acquisition integration charges we will incur in 2023 is dependent upon the timing of closing of the proposed Acquisition. BacklogThe increase in Aerospace Systems Segment backlog in 2022 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in the military OEM and aftermarket businesses. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer.

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operations and meet our strategic capital deployment objectives, which include the following:•Continuing our record annual dividend increases•Investing in organic growth and productivity•Strategic acquisitions that strengthen our portfolio•Offset share dilution through 10b5-1 share repurchase programCash FlowsA summary of cash flows follows:(dollars in millions)20222021Cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$2,442 $2,575 Investing activities(419)— Financing activities3,916 (2,623)Effect of exchange rates(24)96 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash$5,915 $48 Cash flows from operating activities were $2,442 million in 2022 compared to $2,575 million in 2021. This decrease of $133 million was primarily related to net income and cash provided by working capital items, which decreased $431 million and increased $557 million, respectively. After consideration of the non-cash impact of the deal-contingent forward contracts, which increased cash provided by working capital items by $1,015 million and decreased net income by $775 million in 2022, cash flow from operations in 2022 decreased primarily due to a decrease in cash provided by working capital items of $458 million, partially offset by an increase in net income of $344 million. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the deal-contingent forward contracts. •Days sales outstanding relating to trade receivables for the Company was 51 days in 2022 and 50 days in 2021.•Days supply of inventory on hand was 77 days in 2022 and 75 days in 2021.Cash flows from investing activities in 2022 and 2021 were impacted by the following factors:•Net maturities of marketable securities of $4 million in 2022 compared to $45 million in 2021.•Capital expenditures of $230 million in 2022 compared to $210 million in 2021.•Net proceeds from the sale of land of approximately $111 million in 2021.•Cash collateral paid of $250 million in 2022 per the credit support annex (""CSA"") attached to the deal-contingent forward contracts. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Cash flows from financing activities in 2022 and 2021 were impacted by the following factors:•Repurchases of 1.3 million common shares for $380 million during 2022 compared to repurchases of 0.3 million common shares for $100 million during 2021.•Net proceeds from Senior Notes issuance of $3,576 million in 2022 compared to term loan repayments of $1,210 million in 2021. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. •Net commercial paper borrowings of $1,422 million in 2022 compared to net commercial paper repayments of $723 million in 2021.27Table of ContentsCash RequirementsWe are actively monitoring our liquidity position and remain focused on managing our inventory and other working capital requirements. We are continuing to target two percent of sales for capital expenditures and are prioritizing those related to safety and strategic investments. We believe that cash generated from operations and our commercial paper program will satisfy our operating needs for the foreseeable future.We have committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, and postretirement benefit obligations. Refer to Notes 10, 11, and 12 respectively, of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.DividendsDividends have been paid for 288 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 66 years. The current annual dividend rate is $5.32 per common share.Share RepurchasesThe Company has a program to repurchase its common shares. On October 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the overall number of shares authorized to repurchase under the program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was 35 million. There is no limitation on the number of shares that can be repurchased in a year. Repurchases may be funded primarily from operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings and the shares are initially held as treasury shares. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.LiquidityCash, comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments, includes $465 million and $467 million held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company does not permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings. The distribution of these earnings could result in non-federal U.S. or foreign taxes. All other undistributed foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested.We are currently authorized to sell up to $3,000 million of short-term commercial paper notes. There were $1,422 million outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2022, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1,682 million.The Company has a line of credit through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks. During 2022, we amended our existing multi-currency credit agreement, increasing its capacity from $2,500 million to $3,000 million, by exercising the accordion feature. As of June 30, 2022, $1,578 million was available for borrowing under the credit agreement. Advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness. The credit agreement supports our commercial paper program, and issuances of commercial paper reduce the amount of credit available under the agreement. The credit agreement expires in September 2024; however, the Company has the right to request a one-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement. The credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which is dependent upon the Company’s credit ratings. Although a lowering of the Company’s credit ratings would increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit the Company’s ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.We primarily utilize unsecured medium-term notes and senior notes to meet our financing needs and we expect to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. During 2022, the Company issued $1,400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.65 percent Senior Notes due June 15, 2024, $1,200 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25 percent Senior Notes due September 15, 2027, and $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50 percent Senior Notes due September 15, 2029 (collectively, the ""Senior Notes""). We intend to use the proceeds of the Senior Notes to finance a portion of the purchase of the proposed Acquisition. Refer to the Cash flows from financing activities section above and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Additionally, during 2022, we entered into a senior, unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000 million (the “Term Loan Facility”), refer to the Strategic Acquisitions section below for further discussion.The Company’s credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt securities contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. Based on the Company’s rating level at June 30, 2022, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. At June 30, 28Table of Contents2022, the Company's debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.57 to 1.0. We are in compliance, and expect to remain in compliance, with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures.Our goal is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. The rating agencies periodically update our credit ratings as events occur. At June 30, 2022, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows: Fitch RatingsBBB+Moody's Investor Services, Inc.Baa1Standard & Poor'sBBB+Supply Chain FinancingWe continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. We currently have a supply chain financing program (""SCF"") with a financial intermediary, which provides certain suppliers the option to be paid by the financial intermediary earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial intermediary and the suppliers in connection with the programs. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. We do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the program and their participation is completely voluntary. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At June 30, 2022, accounts payable included approximately $46 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the SCF program. In 2022, the amount settled through the SCF program and paid to participating financial institutions totaled $35 million. We account for payments made under the program in the same manner as our other accounts payable, which is a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.Strategic AcquisitionsOn August 2, 2021, the Company announced that it reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Meggitt for 800 pence per share, or approximately £6,263 million. We intend to fund the proposed Acquisition with cash resources, borrowings under debt facilities and net proceeds of debt securities. The proposed Acquisition received the European Commission's clearance on April 11, 2022, conditional on full compliance with commitments offered by the Company, including a commitment to divest its aircraft wheel and brake business within the Aerospace Systems Segment, for which a divestiture agreement was signed on May 23, 2022. The proposed Acquisition and divestiture of the aircraft wheel and brake business remain subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearance.During 2022 we deposited funds, comprised of cash on hand and net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and the Senior Notes, into an escrow account. The escrow account is restricted to payments for the proposed Acquisition. At June 30, 2022, the balance was $6,112 million, which was recorded within the prepaid expenses and other caption on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.Additionally, we entered into a senior, unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2,000 million on August 27, 2021. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility, if drawn, will be used solely by the Company to finance a portion of the consideration of its proposed Acquisition. Refer to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.In connection with the proposed Acquisition, the Company entered into a bridge credit agreement (the ""Bridge Credit Agreement"") on August 2, 2021. Under the Bridge Credit Agreement, lenders committed to provide senior, unsecured financing in the aggregate principal amount of £6,524 million at August 2, 2021. As permanent financing for the proposed Acquisition was secured, the principal amount of the Bridge Credit Agreement was reduced. At June 30, 2022, the available aggregate principal amount was £591 million. In July 2022, we issued $504 million of commercial paper and deposited this amount into the escrow account to finance a portion of the purchase of Meggitt. Additionally, in July 2022, we deposited a total of $250 million into escrow that was previously posted as collateral and recorded within non-trade and notes receivables at June 30, 2022. Refer to Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. In July 2022, after consideration of the escrow balance and funds available under the delayed-draw Term Loan Facility, we reduced the aggregate committed principal amount of the bridge credit agreement (the ""Bridge Credit Agreement"") to zero.29Table of ContentsIn connection with the proposed Acquisition, the Company entered into deal-contingent forward contracts during October 2021 to mitigate the risk of appreciation in the GBP-denominated purchase price. The deal-contingent forward contracts have an aggregate notional amount of £6,415 million, and settlement is contingent upon closing the proposed Acquisition. We are recording the related fair value gains and losses, which have been and may continue to be significant, through the Consolidated Statement of Income until the closing of the proposed Acquisition. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.Revenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations, which are distinct goods or services within the contract, is transferred to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. A majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. However, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment.For contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we use the cost-to-cost, efforts expended or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract, including length of production time. The estimation of costs and efforts expended requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. Adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. Revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer.We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Our six reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which is estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions, including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry-specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. Within the discounted cash flow models, the Company uses a discount rate, commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. The market-based valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of market-adjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies. We also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization.At December 31, 2021, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its six reporting units. The results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. We continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of a reporting unit's fair value as appropriate. 30Table of ContentsLong-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. During 2022, the Company did not record any material impairment related to long-lived assets. Pensions - The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. For the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $17 million and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by $19 million. As of June 30, 2022, $472 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. These losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. Any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help offset the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization. Further information on pensions is provided in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income Taxes - Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Loss Contingencies - The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. We review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.31Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.In connection with the proposed Acquisition, the Company entered into deal-contingent forward contracts during October 2021 to mitigate the risk of appreciation in the GBP-denominated purchase price. The deal-contingent forward contracts have an aggregate notional amount of £6,415 million, and settlement is contingent upon closing the proposed Acquisition. A one percent decrease in the GBP-USD exchange rate would result in a $78 million decrease in the fair value of the contract.Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For cross-currency swaps measured using the spot method, the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense. The translation of the foreign currency denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. At June 30, 2022, our debt portfolio did not include any variable rate debt. However, a 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on weighted average commercial paper balances during 2022 by approximately $15 million.As discussed elsewhere in this report, the future impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic and their residual effects, including economic uncertainty, inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain, labor markets and aerospace industry, on our business remain uncertain. As we cannot anticipate the ultimate duration or scope of the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material.32Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:47:50.456655

The Company publishes its order rates on a quarterly basis. The lead time between the time an order is received and revenue is realized generally ranges from one day to 12 weeks for mobile and industrial orders and from one day to 18 months for aerospace orders.The continuing residual effects of the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic, including the inflationary cost environment as well as disruption within the global supply chain and labor markets, have impacted our business. We continue to manage the challenging supply chain environment through our ""local for local"" manufacturing strategy, ongoing supplier management process, and broadened supply base. We continue to manage the impact of the inflationary cost environment through a variety of cost and pricing measures, including continuous improvement and lean initiatives. Additionally, we strategically manage our workforce and discretionary spending. At the same time, we are appropriately addressing the ongoing needs of our business so that we continue to serve our customers. Over the long-term, the extent to which our business and results of operations will be impacted by economic and political uncertainty depends on future developments that remain uncertain. We will continue to monitor the environment and manage our business with the goal to minimize the impact on operations and financial results. 22Table of ContentsAs previously announced, on March 14, 2022, we detected that an unauthorized party gained access to our systems. After securing our network and concluding our investigation, we found that the data exfiltrated during the incident included personal information of our team members. We have notified individuals whose personal information was involved and offered them credit monitoring services. We have also provided notification regarding the incident to the appropriate regulatory authorities. A consolidated class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against the Company over the incident. The parties have reached a settlement in principle in the lawsuit, which the district court preliminarily approved on March 14, 2023, and finally approved on August 2, 2023. Based on our ongoing assessments, the incident has not had a significant financial or operational impact and has not had a material impact on our business, operations or financial results.The discussion below is structured to separately discuss the Consolidated Statement of Income, Business Segments, and Liquidity and Capital Resources. The term ""year"" and references to specific years refer to the applicable fiscal year. CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOMEThe Consolidated Statement of Income summarizes the Company's operating performance. The discussion below compares the operating performance in 2023, 2022, and 2021.(dollars in millions)20232022*2021*Net sales$19,065 $15,862 $14,348 Gross profit margin33.7 %33.5 %33.1 %Selling, general and administrative expenses$3,354 $2,504 $2,383 Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales17.6 %15.8 %16.6 %Interest expense$574 $255 $250 Other expense (income), net184 945 (28)Gain on disposal of assets(363)(7)(109)Effective tax rate22.2 %18.5 %22.3 %Net income attributable to common shareholders$2,083 $1,316 $1,746 *Years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 amounts have been reclassified to reflect the income statement reclassification, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Net sales in 2023 increased from the 2022 amount due to higher volume in both the Diversified Industrial and Aerospace Systems Segments. The Acquisition completed within the last 12 months increased sales by approximately $2.1 billion during the current year. The effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2023 by approximately $470 million, substantially all of which is attributable to the Diversified Industrial International businesses. Divestitures completed within the last 12 months decreased sales by approximately $69 million in 2023. Net sales in 2022 increased from the 2021 amount due to higher volume in both the Diversified Industrial and Aerospace Systems Segments. The effect of currency rate changes decreased net sales in 2022 by approximately $255 million, substantially all of which is attributable to the Diversified Industrial International businesses. Gross profit margin (calculated as net sales less cost of sales, divided by net sales) increased slightly in 2023 primarily due to higher margins in both the Aerospace Systems and Diversified Industrial Segments. The increase in gross profit margin is primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives, as well as price increases. The increase was partially offset by the step-up in inventory to fair value of $110 million, related to the Acquisition, within the Aerospace Systems Segment. Additionally, increased freight, material and labor costs resulting from the ongoing inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain and labor markets impacted margin. Cost of sales also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $29 million in 2023 compared to $5 million in 2022.Gross profit margin increased in 2022 primarily due to higher margins in both the Aerospace and Diversified Industrial Segments. The increase in gross profit margin is primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives, as well as price increases, partially offset by increased freight, material and labor costs resulting from ongoing inflationary environment and disruption within the global supply chain and labor markets. Cost of sales also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $5 million in 2022 compared to $27 million in 2021.23Table of ContentsSelling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") increased in 2023 primarily due to higher amortization expense, research and development expense, information technology charges, as well as increased general and administrative charges associated with the Acquisition. Additionally, acquisition-related transaction costs for the year totaled $115 million. SG&A also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $94 million and $14 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.SG&A increased in 2022 primarily due to acquisition-related transaction costs of $44 million as well as higher net expense from the Company's deferred compensation plan and related investments and higher professional fees and related expenses. SG&A also included business realignment and acquisition integration charges of $14 million and $31 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest expense in 2023 increased compared to 2022 primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt outstanding. Interest expense in 2022 increased compared to 2021 primarily due to higher average debt outstanding, partially offset by lower average interest rates.Other expense (income), net included the following:(dollars in millions)20232022*2021*Expense (income)Foreign currency transaction loss (gain)$46 $(40)$(11)Income related to equity method investments(124)(76)(41)Non-service components of retirement benefit cost(67)4 49 Interest income(46)(10)(7)Acquisition-related financing fees— 52 — Loss on deal-contingent forward contracts390 1,015 — Russia liquidation— 8 — Other items, net(15)(8)(18)$184 $945 $(28)*Years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 amounts have been reclassified to reflect the income statement reclassification, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Foreign currency transaction loss (gain) primarily relates to the impact of exchange rates on cash, forward contracts, certain cross-currency swap contracts and intercompany transactions. During 2023, it also includes foreign currency transaction loss associated with completing the Acquisition. Acquisition-related financing fees in 2022 relate to the bridge credit agreement (the ""Bridge Credit Agreement"") fees associated with the Acquisition. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Loss on deal-contingent forward contracts in 2023 and 2022 includes a loss on the deal-contingent forward contracts related to the Acquisition. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Gain on disposal of assets in 2023 includes a gain on the sale of the aircraft wheel and brake business within the Aerospace Systems Segment of $374 million. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. In 2021 it primarily consists of a gain of $101 million on the sale of land.Effective tax rate in 2023 was higher than 2022, primarily due to an overall decrease in discrete tax benefits along with a reduction in the benefit from the foreign derived intangible income deduction. Effective tax rate in 2022 was lower than 2021 primarily due to an overall increase in discrete tax benefits. 24Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATIONThe Business Segment information presents sales and operating income on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the Company's various businesses are managed for internal review and decision-making.Diversified Industrial Segment (dollars in millions)202320222021Net SalesNorth America$8,916 $7,703 $6,676 International5,789 5,639 5,284 Operating incomeNorth America1,853 1,515 1,247 International$1,218 $1,178 $988 Operating income as a percent of salesNorth America20.8 %19.7 %18.7 %International21.0 %20.9 %18.7 %Backlog$4,786 $4,510 $3,239 The Diversified Industrial Segment operations experienced the following percentage changes in net sales: 20232022Diversified Industrial North America – as reported15.7 %15.4 %Acquisitions4.0 %— %Currency— %0.1 %Diversified Industrial North America – without acquisitions and currency111.7 %15.3 %Diversified Industrial International – as reported2.7 %6.7 %Acquisitions2.3 %— %Currency(8.3)%(4.9)%Diversified Industrial International – without acquisitions and currency18.7 %11.6 %Total Diversified Industrial Segment – as reported10.2 %11.6 %Acquisitions3.3 %— %Currency(3.5)%(2.0)%Total Diversified Industrial Segment – without acquisitions and currency110.4 %13.6 %1The above presentation reconciles the percentage changes in net sales of the Diversified Industrial Segment reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") to percentage changes in net sales adjusted to remove the effects of the Acquisition made within the last 12 months as well as currency exchange rates (a non-GAAP measure). The effects of the Acquisition and currency exchange rates are removed to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage changes in net sales on a comparable basis from period to period.Net SalesDiversified Industrial North America - Sales in 2023 for the Diversified Industrial North American businesses increased 15.7 percent from 2022. The effect of the Acquisition increased sales by approximately $311 million. Currency exchange rates did not materially impact sales during the year. Excluding the effects of the Acquisition and changes in the currency exchange rates, sales in 2023 for the Diversified Industrial North American businesses increased 11.7 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher demand from distributors and end users across most markets, including, the cars and light trucks, farm and agriculture, construction equipment, heavy-duty truck, oil and gas, lawn and turf, metal fabrication, industrial machinery, semiconductor, and material handling markets, partially offset by lower end user demand in the life sciences market.Sales in 2022 for the Diversified Industrial North American businesses increased 15.4 percent from 2021. The effect of currency exchange rates increased sales by approximately $7 million. Excluding the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2022 for the Diversified Industrial North American businesses increased 15.3 percent from prior-year levels reflecting higher 25Table of Contentsdemand from distributors and end users in virtually all markets, including, the farm and agriculture, life sciences, heavy-duty truck, construction equipment, engines, refrigeration, material handling, metal fabrication, and semiconductor markets.Diversified Industrial International - Sales in the Diversified Industrial International businesses increased 2.7 percent in 2023. The effect of the Acquisition increased sales by approximately $128 million. Currency exchange rates decreased sales by approximately $465 million, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the Eurozone countries, China and Japan. Excluding the effects of the Acquisition and changes in the currency exchange rates, sales in 2023 for the Diversified Industrial International businesses increased 8.7 percent from 2022 levels. During 2023, Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Latin America accounted for approximately 75 percent, 10 percent, and 15 percent, respectively, of the increase in sales.Within Europe, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, cars and light trucks, heavy-duty truck, oil and gas, industrial machinery, material handling, metal fabrication, farm and agriculture, and semiconductor markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the power generation market.Within the Asia Pacific region, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, cars and light trucks, marine, heavy-duty truck, telecommunications, engines, and mining markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the life sciences, refrigeration, and semiconductor markets.Within Latin America, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the cars and light trucks, oil and gas, farm and agriculture, railroad, and metal fabrication markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the construction equipment and industrial machinery markets.Sales in the Diversified Industrial International businesses increased 6.7 percent in 2022. The effect of currency rate changes decreased sales by $256 million, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against currencies in the Eurozone countries, Turkey and Japan. Excluding the effect of currency rate changes, sales in 2022 for the Diversified Industrial International businesses increased 11.6 percent from 2021 levels. During 2022, Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Latin America accounted for approximately 70 percent, 20 percent, and 10 percent, respectively, of the increase in sales.Within Europe, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the construction equipment, heavy-duty truck, industrial machinery, life sciences, machine tool, mining, material handling, engines, and forestry markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the cars and light trucks, semiconductor, telecommunications, and oil and gas markets.Within the Asia Pacific region, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the semiconductor, refrigeration, industrial machinery, life sciences, and machine tool markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the engines, power generation, heavy-duty truck, railroad equipment, and material handling markets.Within Latin America, the increase in sales was primarily due to higher demand from distributors and end users in the farm and agriculture, cars and light trucks, mining, heavy-duty truck, construction equipment, and industrial machinery markets, partially offset by a decrease in end-user demand in the power generation and life sciences markets.Operating MarginDiversified Industrial North America - Operating margins in 2023 increased from 2022 primarily due to benefits from higher sales volume, continuous improvement initiatives and price increases, partially offset by higher material and operating costs resulting from the inflationary environment, as well as unfavorable product mix.Diversified Industrial International - Operating margins in 2023 increased from 2022 primarily due to benefits from continuous improvement initiatives and price increases, partially offset by higher material and operating costs resulting from the inflationary environment, as well as unfavorable product mix.Operating margins in 2022 increased from 2021 in both the North American and International businesses primarily due to higher sales volume and benefits from continuous improvement initiatives, as well as price increases. These increases were partially offset by increased operating costs, including higher freight, material, and labor costs resulting from the ongoing disruption within the current supply chain environment and labor market. In addition, within the International businesses, operating margin in 2022 benefited from savings related to prior-year restructuring actions.26Table of ContentsBusiness RealignmentThe following business realignment and acquisition integration charges are included in Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International operating income:(dollars in millions)202320222021Diversified Industrial North America$9 $4 $14 Diversified Industrial International23 14 36 Business realignment charges include severance costs related to actions taken under the Company's simplification initiative aimed at reducing organizational and process complexity, as well as plant closures. Acquisition integration charges in the current year relate to the acquisition of Meggitt, and charges in both 2022 and 2021 relate to the 2020 acquisition of Lord. During 2021, business realignment charges primarily consisted of actions taken to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Business realignment and acquisition integration charges within the Diversified Industrial International businesses were primarily incurred in Europe.During 2022, we also incurred $6 million of expense within the Diversified Industrial International businesses as a result of our exit of business operations in Russia. These charges primarily consist of write-downs of inventory and other working capital items.We anticipate that cost savings realized from the workforce reduction measures taken during 2023 will increase operating income in 2024 by approximately one percent in the Diversified Industrial International businesses and will not materially impact operating income in the Diversified Industrial North American businesses. We expect to continue to take actions necessary to structure appropriately the operations of the Diversified Industrial Segment. These actions are expected to result in approximately $78 million in business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2024. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur. BacklogThe increase in Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2023 was primarily due to the addition of Meggitt backlog, partially offset by shipments exceeding orders in both the North American and International businesses. Excluding the addition of Meggitt backlog, North American and International businesses accounted for approximately 60 percent and 40 percent of the change, respectively. Within the International business, the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Latin America accounted for approximately 80 percent, 15 percent, and five percent of the change, respectively.The increase in Diversified Industrial Segment backlog in 2022 was primarily due to orders exceeding shipments in both the North American and International businesses. Backlog within the North American and International businesses accounted for approximately 75 percent and 25 percent of the change, respectively. Within the International business, the Asia Pacific region, Europe and Latin America accounted for approximately 60 percent, 30 percent, and 10 percent of the change, respectively. Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale.

Sales also increased compared to 2022 due to higher volume in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses, partially offset by lower military OEM and aftermarket volume. The increase in sales was partially offset by divestitures during 2023.27Table of ContentsSales in 2022 were higher than the 2021 level primarily due to higher commercial aftermarket and OEM volume, partially offset by lower military OEM and aftermarket volume.Operating MarginAerospace Systems Segment operating margin decreased in 2023 primarily due to acquisition-related expenses, including higher estimated amortization and depreciation expense associated with the preliminary fair value estimates of intangible assets, plant and equipment, and inventory, as well as acquisition integration charges. Additionally, higher commercial OEM volume, an increase in contract loss reserves related to certain commercial OEM programs, challenges created by the disruption within the supply chain and labor markets and higher engineering development expenses also contributed to the lower operating margin. These factors were partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and cost containment initiatives.Aerospace Systems Segment operating margin increased in 2022 primarily due to higher sales volume, favorable commercial aftermarket product mix, higher aftermarket profitability as well as lower unfunded engineering development expenses. These benefits were partially offset by challenges created by the ongoing inflationary environment, disruption within the supply chain and labor markets as well as unfavorable commercial OEM product mix.Business RealignmentWithin the Aerospace Systems Segment, we incurred acquisition integration and business realignment charges of $90 million in 2023. We expect to incur approximately $27 million in business realignment and acquisition integration charges in 2024. However, continually changing business conditions could impact the ultimate costs we incur.During 2022, we incurred $7 million of expense within the Aerospace Systems Segment as a result of our exit of business operations in Russia. These charges primarily consist of write-downs of inventory and other working capital items.BacklogThe increase in Aerospace Systems Segment backlog in 2023 was primarily due to the addition of Meggitt backlog as well as orders exceeding shipments in the commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses and the military OEM and aftermarket businesses.

Refer to Notes 10, 11, and 12 respectively, of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.DividendsDividends have been paid for 292 consecutive quarters, including a yearly increase in dividends for the last 67 years. The current annual dividend rate is $5.92 per common share.Share RepurchasesThe Company has a program to repurchase its common shares. On October 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase in the overall number of shares authorized to repurchase under the program so that, beginning on such date, the aggregate number of shares authorized for repurchase was 35 million. There is no limitation on the number of shares that can be repurchased in a year. Repurchases may be funded primarily from operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings and the shares are initially held as treasury shares. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.LiquidityCash, comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and other investments, includes $422 million, $465 million, and $467 million held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The Company does not permanently reinvest certain foreign earnings. The distribution of these earnings could result in non-federal U.S. or foreign taxes. All other undistributed foreign earnings remain permanently reinvested.We are currently authorized to sell up to $3.0 billion of short-term commercial paper notes. There were $1.8 billion outstanding commercial paper notes as of June 30, 2023, and the largest amount of commercial paper notes outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.1 billion.The Company has a line of credit totaling $3.0 billion through a multi-currency revolving credit agreement with a group of banks. As of June 30, 2023, $1.2 billion was available for borrowing under the credit agreement. Advances from the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and for the refinancing of existing indebtedness. The credit agreement supports our commercial paper program, and issuances of commercial paper reduce the amount of credit available under the agreement. During 2023, the Company amended its credit agreement and extended the expiration to June 2028. The Company has the right to request a one-year extension of the expiration date on an annual basis, which request may result in changes to the current terms and conditions of the credit agreement. The credit agreement requires the payment of an annual facility fee, the amount of which is dependent upon the Company’s credit ratings. Although a lowering of the Company’s credit ratings would increase the cost of future debt, it would not limit the Company’s ability to use the credit agreement nor would it accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.We primarily utilize unsecured medium-term notes and senior notes to meet our financing needs and we expect to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. During 2022, the Company issued $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.65 percent Senior Notes due June 15, 2024, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.25 percent Senior Notes due September 15, 2027, and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.50 percent Senior Notes due September 15, 2029 (collectively, the ""Senior Notes""). We used proceeds of the Senior Notes to finance a portion of the Acquisition. The Company’s credit agreements and indentures governing certain debt securities contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit agreements for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. Based on the Company’s rating level at June 30, 2023, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of debt to debt-shareholders' equity cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.0. At June 30, 2023, the Company's debt to debt-shareholders' equity ratio was 0.55 to 1.0. We are in compliance, and expect to remain in compliance, with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement and indentures.31Table of ContentsOur goal is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. The rating agencies periodically update our credit ratings as events occur. At June 30, 2023, the long-term credit ratings assigned to the Company's senior debt securities by the credit rating agencies engaged by the Company were as follows: Fitch RatingsBBB+Moody's Investor Services, Inc.Baa1Standard & Poor'sBBB+Supply Chain FinancingWe continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. We currently have supply chain financing (""SCF"") programs with financial intermediaries, which provide certain suppliers the option to be paid by the financial intermediaries earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial intermediaries and the suppliers in connection with the programs. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the programs. We do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the programs and their participation is completely voluntary. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF programs are included in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accounts payable included approximately $85 million and $46 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the SCF programs as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. In 2023 and 2022, the amount settled through the SCF programs and paid to participating financial institutions totaled $284 million and $35 million, respectively. The increase in the amount outstanding in the programs from the June 30, 2022 balance is primarily due to the addition of Meggitt's SCF program. We account for payments made under the programs in the same manner as our other accounts payable, which is a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.Strategic AcquisitionsUpon announcing the Acquisition on August 2, 2021, the Company entered into the Bridge Credit Agreement where lenders committed to provide senior, unsecured financing in the aggregate principal amount of £6.5 billion. In July 2022, after consideration of an escrow balance designated for the Acquisition and funds available under the $2.0 billion Term Loan Facility, we reduced the aggregate committed principal amount of the Bridge Credit Agreement to zero, and the Bridge Credit Agreement was terminated.During September 2022, the Company fully drew against the $2.0 billion Term Loan Facility, which will mature in September 2025, to finance a portion of the Acquisition. Subsequently, during the year we made principal payments totaling $1.1 billion related to the Term Loan Facility. Refer to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.On September 12, 2022, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding ordinary shares of Meggitt for 800 pence per share, resulting in an aggregate cash purchase price of $7.2 billion, including the assumption of debt. We funded the purchase using cash and net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper and the Term Loan Facility, which were accumulated in an escrow account designated for the Acquisition. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Upon closing the Acquisition, we settled the deal-contingent forward contracts entered into during October 2021 to mitigate the risk of appreciation in the GBP-denominated purchase price. These deal-contingent forward contracts had an aggregate notional amount of £6.4 billion. Refer to the Cash Flows section above and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.On April 11, 2022, the European Commission cleared the Acquisition, conditional on full compliance with commitments offered by Parker, including a commitment to divest its aircraft wheel and brake business within the Aerospace Systems Segment. In accordance with these commitments, we sold the aircraft wheel and brake business in September 2022 for proceeds of $443 million. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment.32Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition - Revenues are recognized when control of performance obligations, which are distinct goods or services within the contract, is transferred to the customer. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the goods or services. A majority of our revenues are recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. However, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time if the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced, or if the product has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment.For contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we use the cost-to-cost or units of delivery method depending on the nature of the contract, including length of production time. The estimation of costs and efforts expended requires management's judgment due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved. Adjustments to these estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues.When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service. Revenue is recognized when control of the individual performance obligations is transferred to the customer.We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assess variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount, including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time.Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets - We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Our five reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, determining whether an impairment occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit, which is estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based valuation method utilizes a discounted cash flow model which requires several assumptions, including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry-specific market conditions. Each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. Within the discounted cash flow models, the Company uses a discount rate, commensurate with its cost of capital but adjusted for inherent business risks, and an appropriate terminal growth factor. The market-based valuation performed for each reporting unit includes an analysis consisting of market-adjusted multiples based on key data points for guideline public companies. We also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulting from these procedures to our overall market capitalization.At December 31, 2022, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its five reporting units. The results of this test indicated the fair value substantially exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. We continually monitor our reporting units for impairment indicators and update assumptions used in the most recent calculation of a reporting unit's fair value as appropriate. Long-lived assets held for use, which primarily includes finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value. The long-term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test. During 2023, the Company did not record any material impairments related to long-lived assets. Pensions - The annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the Company's defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis. This determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets, increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses. Assumptions are determined based on Company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. Changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements. 33Table of ContentsFor the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan, a 50 basis point change in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have an $18 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to decrease annual pension expense by $3 million. As of June 30, 2023, $342 million of past years' net actuarial losses related to the Company's domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future. These losses will generally be amortized over approximately seven years and will negatively affect earnings in the future. Any actuarial gains experienced in future years will help offset the effect of the net actuarial loss amortization. Further information on pensions is provided in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Business Combinations - From time to time, we may enter into business combinations. Business acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. In the fair value evaluation of intangible assets acquired, there are significant estimates and assumptions, including forecasts of future cash flows, revenues; and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; as well as the selection of the royalty rates and discount rates. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The acquisition method of accounting also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes - Significant judgment is required in determining the Company's income tax expense and in evaluating tax positions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been recorded for the differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Factors considered by the Company in determining the probability of realizing deferred income tax assets include forecasted operating earnings, available tax planning strategies and the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse. The Company reviews its tax positions on a regular basis and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon examination by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information will be recorded. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Loss Contingencies - The Company has a number of loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims, product liability and litigation reserves. Establishing loss accruals for these matters requires management's estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization. We review these loss accruals periodically and make adjustments to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.34Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.A substantial portion of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries conduct their business primarily in their local currencies, which are also their functional currencies. Foreign currency exposures arise from translation of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars and from transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. Although the amount of this activity has increased with the Acquisition, we expect to continue to manage the associated foreign currency transaction and translation risk using existing processes.The Company manages foreign currency transaction and translation risk by utilizing derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, including forward exchange contracts, deal-contingent forward contracts, costless collar contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges. The derivative financial instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions and we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of the counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.Derivative financial instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. Further information on the fair value of these contracts is provided in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through the Consolidated Statement of Income. Derivatives that are designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value by recording gains and losses through accumulated other comprehensive (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For cross-currency swaps measured using the spot method, the periodic interest settlements are recognized directly in earnings through interest expense. The translation of the foreign currency denominated debt that has been designated as a net investment hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) and remains there until the underlying net investment is sold or substantially liquidated.The Company's debt portfolio contains variable rate debt, inherently exposing the Company to interest rate risk. The Company's objective is to maintain a 60/40 mix between fixed rate and variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in near-term interest rates. At June 30, 2023, our debt portfolio included $875 million of variable rate debt, exclusive of commercial paper borrowings. A 100 basis point increase in near-term interest rates would increase annual interest expense on variable rate debt, including weighted-average commercial paper borrowings during 2023, by approximately $25 million.35Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:47:53.267855

The Company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of EUR 300 million. The swap agreements expire in November 2005 and effectively protect the Company against adverse interest rate changes in the EURO bond market and have been designated as a -18- hedge against the Company’s anticipated refinancing of its EURO Notes that are due in November 2005. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of approximately $12 million as of June 30, 2005, which has been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The net payment or receipt under the swap agreements will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the EURO Notes anticipated to be issued in November 2005.
