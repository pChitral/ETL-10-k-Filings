Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 2%, revenues increased 9% for 2016. Revenues benefited from market growth and expanded volume with existing customers within our North America pharmaceutical distribution businesses. Revenues for 2015 also increased as a result of our February 2014 acquisition of Celesio AG (“Celesio”). Market growth reflects growing drug utilization, which includes newly launched drugs and price increases, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Gross profit was flat in 2016 and increased 37% in 2015 compared to the same periods a year ago. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 4%, gross profit increased 4% in 2016. Gross profit margin decreased in 2016 primarily due to a lower sell margin within our North America distribution business driven by increased customer sales volume with some of our largest customers, partially offset by higher buy margin including benefits from our global procurement arrangements, lower LIFO-related inventory charges and $76 million in cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. Additionally, this business has been experiencing weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends, which are expected to continue in 2017. Gross profit margin increased in 2015 primarily due to our Celesio acquisition, higher buy margin including the effects of generic price increases and our mix of business, partially offset by lower sell profit. Gross profit included LIFO-related inventory charges of $244 million, $337 million and $311 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.Operating expenses decreased 7% and increased 43% in 2016 and 2015 compared to the same periods a year ago. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 5%, operating expenses decreased 2% in 2016 primarily due to pre-tax gains of $103 million from the sale of two businesses and lower acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by pre-tax restructuring charges of $203 million, as further discussed below. Additionally, 2015 operating expenses included a pre-tax and after-tax $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various U.S. Attorney’s offices.33Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)On March 14, 2016, the Company committed to a restructuring plan to lower its operating costs (“Cost Alignment Plan”). The Cost Alignment Plan primarily consists of a reduction in workforce and business process initiatives that will be substantially implemented prior to the end of 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded $229 million of pre-tax restructuring charges primarily representing severance and employee-related costs. The charges were included in our results as follows: $26 million in cost of sales and $203 million in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased in 2015 primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. Additionally, operating expenses for 2015 included the $150 million settlement charge and for 2014, included $68 million of pre-tax charges associated with our Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) litigation.Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased in 2016 compared with the prior year primarily due to lower operating expenses, and increased in 2015 primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating and interest expense. Our reported income tax rates were 27.9%, 30.7% and 34.9% in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Income tax expense for 2014 included a charge of $122 million relating to our litigation with the Canadian Revenue Agency (“CRA”). Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2016 and 2015 primarily reflects the recurring annual compensation and the guaranteed dividends that McKesson is obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”), which became effective in December 2014.Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2015 included pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $241 million ($235 million after-tax) associated with our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business, which we acquired through our acquisition of Celesio. On January 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell this business to a third party. The sale is expected to be completed during the first half of 2017, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. We expect to recognize an after-tax charge of approximately $80 million to $100 million upon the disposition of the business within discontinued operations as a result of settlement of certain indemnifications. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2014 included a non-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of $80 million related to our International Technology business, which was sold in part in 2015.Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $2,258 million, $1,476 million and $1,263 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from continuing operations were $9.84, $7.54 and $6.08 and diluted loss per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from discontinued operations were $0.14, $1.27 and $0.67 in 2016, 2015 and 2014.We have recently acquired or have agreements to acquire a number of businesses whose financial results will be reported within our Distribution Solutions segment from their respective acquisition date. These businesses are described in Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 34Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Revenues: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2014 2016 2015Distribution Solutions North America pharmaceutical distribution& services$158,469 $143,711 $123,929 10% 16%International pharmaceutical distribution & services23,497 26,358 4,485 (11) 488 Medical-Surgical distribution & services6,033 5,907 5,648 2 5 Total Distribution Solutions187,999 175,976 134,062 7 31 Technology Solutions - products and services2,885 3,069 3,330 (6) (8) Total Revenues$190,884 $179,045 $137,392 7% 30%Revenues increased 7% and 30% in 2016 and 2015 compared to the same periods a year ago. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 2%, revenues increased 9% in 2016. These increases were primarily driven by our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 98% of our consolidated revenues. Distribution SolutionsNorth America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth, expanded business with existing customers and our mix of business. These increases were partially offset by customer losses. Market growth reflects growing drug utilization, which includes newly launched drugs and price increases, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Additionally, our 2015 revenues benefited from newly launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2016 decreased 11%. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 12%, revenues increased 1% in 2016 primarily reflecting higher revenues in the United Kingdom due to a new distribution agreement with a manufacturer, which was almost fully offset by lower revenues in Norway associated with the loss of a hospital contract. Revenues increased in 2015 primarily due to our acquisition of Celesio in February 2014.Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth. Revenues for 2016 were unfavorably affected by the sale of our ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of 2016. Our Distribution Solutions segment is experiencing customer consolidation, including business combinations that impact our customers. Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions revenues decreased over the last two years primarily due to a decline in hospital software revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in our other businesses. Additionally, 2016 revenues decreased as a result of the sale of our nurse triage business and the transition of our workforce business within our International Technology business to a third party during the first quarter of 2016. Revenues decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decline in hospital software revenues, the planned elimination of a product line and lower revenues from the workforce business within our International Technology business, which was transitioned to another service provider during the first quarter of 2016. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in our other businesses.35Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2014 2016 2015Gross Profit Distribution Solutions (1) (2)$9,948 $9,937 $6,745 - % 47%Technology Solutions (2)1,468 1,474 1,607 - (8) Total$11,416 $11,411 $8,352 - % 37% Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions5.29% 5.65% 5.03% (36)bp 62bp Technology Solutions50.88 48.03 48.26 285 (23) Total5.98 6.37 6.08 (39) 29 bp - basis points(1)Gross profit for our Distribution Solutions segment includes LIFO expenses of $244 million, $337 million and $311 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, and for 2016 and 2014 includes $76 million and $37 million of net cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements.(2)Gross profit includes pre-tax restructuring charges of $5 million and $21 million for the Cost Alignment Plan within our Distribution Solutions segment and Technology Solutions segment in 2016. Gross profit was flat in 2016 and increased 37% in 2015 compared to the same periods a year ago. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 4%, gross profit increased 4% in 2016. Gross profit margin decreased in 2016 and increased in 2015. These changes were primarily due to our Distribution Solutions segment.Distribution SolutionsDistribution Solutions segment’s gross profit was flat in 2016 and increased in 2015. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 4%, gross profit increased 4% in 2016. Gross profit margin decreased in 2016 primarily due to a lower sell margin within our North America distribution business driven by increased customer sales volume with some of our largest customers, partially offset by higher buy margin including benefits from our global procurement arrangements, lower LIFO-related inventory charges and $76 million in cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. Additionally, this business has been experiencing weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends, which are expected to continue in 2017. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers, including the effects of price increases of both branded and generic drugs. Gross profit margin increased in 2015 primarily due to our Celesio acquisition, higher buy margin including the effects of generic price increases and our mix of business, partially offset by lower sell profit. Gross profit margin for 2015 was unfavorably affected by the increased sales associated with newly launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C. Additionally, gross profit margin for 2014 included a $50 million charge for the reversal of a fair value step-up of inventory acquired through our Celesio acquisition and $37 million of cash receipts representing our share of antitrust settlements.Our LIFO-related inventory expenses were $244 million, $337 million and $311 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Our North America distribution business uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The business’ practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the net impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the net impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. Our annual LIFO expense is affected by changes in year-end inventory quantities, product mix and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be influenced by market and other external influences. Changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual LIFO expense. LIFO expense decreased in 2016 primarily due to the impact of lower price increases. 36Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)As a result of cumulative net price deflation, at March 31, 2013, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were more than market and accordingly, a $60 million lower-of-cost or market (“LCM”) reserve reduced inventories to market. Starting in 2014, we have experienced net inflation in our pharmaceutical inventories and LIFO-related charges were incurred, and accordingly, the $60 million LCM reserve was fully released resulting in an increase in gross profit. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO did not exceed market.Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions segment’s gross profit decreased over the last two years. Gross profit margin increased in 2016 and decreased in 2015. In addition to changes in our mix of business, gross profit margin was impacted by:2016 vs. 2015: Gross profit margin benefited from the sale of our nurse triage business, transitioning of our workforce business within our International Technology business to a third party, and higher pull-through of deferred revenue. These increases were partially offset by $49 million of pre-tax reduction-in-force severance charges, including charges associated with the Cost Alignment Plan. Additionally, in 2015 we recorded a $34 million pre-tax non-cash charge representing a catch-up in depreciation and amortization expense associated with our workforce business within our International Technology business. This business, which was previously designated as a discontinued operation, was reclassified to a continuing operation in 2015 when we decided to retain the business. 2015 vs. 2014: In 2015, gross profit margin was negatively impacted by the $34 million non-cash depreciation and amortization charge, partially offset by a decrease in product alignment charges. In 2014, we recorded $57 million of pre-tax product alignment charges, which primarily relate to employee severance and asset impairments. Charges were recorded in our 2014 financial results as follows: $34 million in cost of sales and $23 million in operating expenses. Additionally, gross profit margin was favorably impacted by the planned elimination of a product line.

Operating expenses for 2016 decreased 7% and increased 43% in 2015 compared to the same periods a year ago. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 5%, operating expenses decreased 2% for 2016. On March 14, 2016, the Company committed to a restructuring plan to lower its operating costs, as previously discussed. The Cost Alignment Plan primarily consists of a reduction in workforce and business process initiatives that will be substantially implemented prior to the end of 2019. Business process initiatives primarily include plans to reduce operating costs of our distribution and pharmacy operations, administrative support functions, and technology platforms, as well as the disposal and abandonment of certain non-core businesses. 37Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)As a result of the Cost Alignment Plan, the Company expects to record total pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million to $290 million. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded $229 million of pre-tax restructuring charges primarily representing severance and employee-related costs. The charges were included in our results as follows: $26 million in cost of sales and $203 million in operating expenses. Estimated remaining charges primarily consist of exit-related costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization, which are largely attributed to our Distribution Solutions segment. Estimated savings in 2017 as a result of this plan are approximately $200 million to $220 million. Additional information on our Cost Alignment Plan is included in Financial Note 3, “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Distribution SolutionsDistribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses for 2016 decreased 7% compared to the prior year. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 5%, operating expenses decreased 2%. Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to a $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims recorded in the prior year, lower acquisition-related expenses relating to integration activities for our acquisitions and the sale of our ZEE Medical business, including a $52 million pre-tax gain on sale. These decreases were partially offset by pre-tax charges of $156 million associated with the Cost Alignment Plan, higher compensation and benefit costs and bad debt expense. Operating expense and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. Operating expenses in 2015 also included a $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the DEA, DOJ and various U.S. Attorney’s offices, and 2014 operating expenses included $68 million of charges associated with our AWP litigation.

These decreases were partially offset by pre-tax charges of $30 million for the Cost Alignment Plan as well as the write-off of internal-use software. Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2015 decreased from the comparable year primarily due to lower research and development expenses, integration-related expenses and severance charges. CorporateCorporate expenses increased in 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to pre-tax charges of $17 million associated with the Cost Alignment Plan, partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses and a decrease in compensation and benefit costs. Corporate expenses increased in 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs and asset impairments, partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses and lower costs associated with corporate initiatives. Acquisition Expenses and Related AdjustmentsAcquisition expenses and related adjustments, which include transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to acquisitions by the Company were $114 million, $224 million and $218 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Expenses primarily related to our business acquisitions and integrations of our February 2014 acquisition of Celesio and February 2013 acquisition of PSS World Medical, Inc.

These expenses primarily include restructuring, severance, employee retention incentives, outside service fees and other costs to integrate the business, and bridge loan fees. Additionally, our acquisition-related expenses for our PSSI acquisition include amounts associated with distribution center rationalization and information technology conversions to common platforms. Integration activities for our PSSI acquisition are substantially completed.

Segment Operating ProfitDistribution Solutions: Operating profit increased over the last two years primarily due to growth in our business and for 2015 due to our business acquisitions. Operating profit margin for 2016 increased due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin. Operating profit and operating profit margin in 2016 includes $161 million of pre-tax charges associated with the Cost Alignment Plan, lower LIFO charges, and a $52 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our ZEE Medical business. Operating profit margin for 2015 decreased primarily due to our acquisition of Celesio and the unfavorable impact from the newly launched drugs for Hepatitis C, partially offset by our other mix of business. In 2015 and 2014, operating profit and operating profit margin includes $150 million and $68 million of reserve adjustments for estimated probable losses related to our controlled substance distribution claims and AWP litigation. 40Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Technology Solutions: Operating profit and operating profit margin increased in 2016 primarily due to higher gross profit margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Operating profit and operating profit margin for 2016 includes a $51 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our nurse triage business and $51 million of pre-tax charges associated with the Cost Alignment Plan. Operating profit margin increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin. In 2015 and 2014, operating profit and operating profit margin were unfavorably affected by $34 million and $57 million of charges associated with a depreciation and amortization catch-up related to 2014, and product alignment and impairment charges. Corporate: Corporate expenses, net, increased over the last two years primarily due to higher operating expenses as previously discussed. Interest Expense: Interest expense decreased in 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to repayments of debt and certain foreign currency-denominated credit facilities. Interest expense increased in 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the March 2014 issuance of $4.1 billion of new debt to fund the acquisition of Celesio and due to interest on Celesio’s debt. Interest expense for 2014 also included $46 million of bridge loan fees associated with the initial funding of the acquisition of Celesio. Partially offsetting these increases, interest expense benefited from the repayment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2014.Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees. Income Taxes During 2016, 2015 and 2014, income tax expense related to continuing operations was $908 million, $815 million and $757 million, which included net discrete tax benefits of $42 million and $33 million in 2016 and 2015 and a net discrete tax expense of $94 million in 2014. Our reported income tax rates were 27.9%, 30.7% and 34.9% in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates, and discrete items. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.We received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) related to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2013. During 2016, we reached an agreement to settle the transfer pricing matter for years 2003 through 2013 and recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $8 million.The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently examining our U.S. corporation income tax returns for 2007 through 2009 and may issue a Revenue Agent Report during the first quarter of 2017. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, and we do not anticipate a significant impact to our gross unrecognized tax benefits. During 2015, we reached an agreement with the IRS to settle all outstanding issues relating to years 2003 through 2006 and recognized discrete tax benefits of $55 million to record previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest.41Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxLosses from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $32 million, $299 million and $156 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.In 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business within our Distribution Solutions segment, which we acquired through our February 2014 acquisition of Celesio. Loss from discontinued operations, net for 2015 included $241 million of non-cash pre-tax ($235 million after-tax) impairment charges, which were recorded to reduce the carrying value of this business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. On January 31, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell the Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business to a third party. The sale is expected to be completed during the first half of 2017, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. We expect to recognize an after-tax charge of approximately $80 million to $100 million upon the disposition of the business within discontinued operations as a result of settlement of certain indemnifications.Loss from discontinued operations, net for 2015 also included a pre-tax and after-tax loss of $6 million from the sale of a software business within our International Technology business. Loss from discontinued operations, net for 2014, included a pre-tax and after-tax loss of $5 million and $7 million within our discontinued operations from the sale of our Hospital Automation business. Additionally, during 2014, we recorded an $80 million non-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Refer to Financial Note 9, “Discontinued Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2016 and 2015 primarily represents the guaranteed dividends and the annual recurring compensation that we are obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio under the Domination Agreement. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2014 primarily represents the portion of Celesio’s net loss that was not allocable to McKesson Corporation. Refer to Financial Note 10, “Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation: Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $2,258 million, $1,476 million and $1,263 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 and diluted earnings per common share were $9.70, $6.27 and $5.41. Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 233 million, 235 million and 233 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding is affected by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and in 2016 and 2014, the cumulative effect of share repurchases.Foreign OperationsOur foreign operations represented approximately 17%, 20% and 11% of our consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency effect”, which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In computing foreign currency effect, we translate our current year results in local currencies into U.S dollars by applying average foreign exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods in U.S. dollars. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in Financial Note 27, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 42Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Business CombinationsRefer to Financial Notes 2 and 16, “Business Combinations” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.2017 OutlookInformation regarding the Company’s 2017 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 5, 2016. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.43Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes general and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2016, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) accounted for approximately 52.4% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 20.3% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2016, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 32% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS were approximately 18% of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2016 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future.At March 31, 2016, trade and notes receivables were $14,685 million prior to allowances of $212 million. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, our provision for bad debts was $113 million, $67 million and $36 million. At March 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.4% and 1.1%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2016 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $15 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”). Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $15.3 billion and $14.3 billion at March 31, 2016 and 2015. 44Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The LIFO method was used to value approximately 74% and 73% of our inventories at March 31, 2016 and 2015. If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately $1,012 million and $768 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2016 and 2015. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized net LIFO expense of $244 million, $337 million and $311 million within our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9,786 million and $9,817 million of goodwill at March 31, 2016 and 2015 and $3,021 million and $3,441 million of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2016 and 2015. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.45Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangibles assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Currently, all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to thirty-eight years. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. There were no material impairments of intangibles in 2016, 2015 or 2014 within our continuing operations. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, supplier reserves were $144 million and $167 million. The final outcome of any outstanding claims may differ from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2016 and 2015 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2016 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $29 million in 2016. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. 46Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,272 million and $1,189 million at March 31, 2016 and 2015 and deferred tax liabilities of $3,947 million and $3,791 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and intangible assets. We established valuation allowances of $267 million and $229 million for 2016 and 2015 against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 1% in our 2016 effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes of approximately $33 million for 2016. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.47Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our revolving credit facilities, accounts receivable factoring facilities and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time to time. We are in the process of acquiring certain businesses, and the cost of these acquisitions may be partially funded through the issuance of debt.Net cash flow from operating activities was $3,672 million in 2016 compared to $3,112 million in 2015 and $3,136 million in 2014. Operating activities over the last three years were affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables and inventories primarily associated with our revenue growth. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements and vendor payment terms.Net cash used in investing activities was $1,557 million in 2016 compared to $677 million in 2015 and $5,046 million in 2014. Investing activities for 2016 include $40 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, $488 million and $189 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $210 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses. Additionally, we prepaid $939 million for acquisitions that closed subsequent to year end. Investing activities for 2015 included $170 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, $376 million and $169 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $15 million of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and an equity investment. Investing activities for 2014 included $4,634 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $4,497 million for our acquisition of Celesio. Investing activities in 2014 also included $278 million and $141 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $97 million of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and equity investment. Financing activities utilized $3,453 million and $968 million of cash in 2016 and 2015 and generated net cash of $3,619 million in 2014. Financing activities for 2016 include cash receipts of $1,561 million and payments of $1,688 million from short-term borrowings. We made repayments on long-term debt of $1,598 million in 2016. Financing activities in 2016 also include $1,504 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $244 million of dividends paid. Financing activities for 2015 include cash receipts of $3,100 million and payments of $3,152 million from short-term borrowings. Long-term debt repayments in 2015 were primarily cash paid on promissory notes. Financing activities in 2015 also reflect a cash payment of $32 million to acquire approximately 1 million additional common shares of Celesio through the tender offers we completed in 2015. Additionally, financing activities for 2015 include $340 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $227 million of dividends paid. Financing activities for 2014 include cash receipts of $6,080 million and cash paid of $6,132 million from short-term borrowings, which includes $4,957 million in borrowings under a senior bridge loan facility in connection with our acquisition of Celesio and $400 million under our accounts receivable sales facility in February 2014. These borrowings were fully repaid in March 2014. Financing activities for 2014 also include cash receipts of $4,124 million from the issuance of long-term debt in March 2014 and cash paid of $348 million for repayments of long-term debt. Additionally, financing activities for 2014 included $130 million of cash payments for stock repurchases and $214 million of dividends paid.The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. The Board authorized the repurchase of the Company’s common stock up to $2 billion in October 2015 and up to $500 million in May 2015. In 2016, we repurchased 8.7 million of our shares through both an ASR program and open market transactions, and in 2015 repurchased 1.5 million of our shares all through open market transactions. All share repurchases were funded with cash on hand.48Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Years Ended March 31,(In millions, except per share data)2016 2015 2014Number of shares repurchased (1)8.7 1.5 —Average price paid per share$173.64 $226.55 $—Total value of shares repurchased (1)$1,504 $340 $—(1)Excludes shares surrendered for tax withholding.At March 31, 2016, the total authorization outstanding was $1.0 billion available under the October 2015 share repurchase plan for future repurchases of the Company’s common stock.We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2014Cash and cash equivalents$4,048 $5,341 $4,193 Working capital3,366 3,173 3,221 Debt to capital ratio (1)43.7% 50.3% 55.4%Return on McKesson stockholders’ equity (2)26.0 17.0 16.2 (1)Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).(2)Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in Euros, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2016 included approximately $2.2 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations and acquisitions as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2016 compared to March 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in receivables and inventories and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2015 compared to March 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories. 49Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Our debt to capital ratio improved over the last two years primarily due to a decrease in our debt. In July 2015, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.24 to $0.28 per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board. Dividends were $1.08 per share in 2016, $0.96 per share in 2015 and $0.92 per share in 2014. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid total cash dividends of $244 million, $227 million and $214 million. Additionally, as required under the Domination Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per Celesio share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio.Contractual Obligations:The table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2016: Years(In millions)Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5On balance sheet Long-term debt (1)$8,147 $1,612 $2,550 $5 $3,980Other (2) (3)643 198 269 54 122 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (4)2,725 298 456 322 1,649Purchase obligations (5)4,750 4,668 68 14 —Operating lease obligations (6) 1,970 363 561 377 669Other (7)340 194 18 24 104Total$18,575 $7,333 $3,922 $796 $6,524(1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations.

The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.Our banks and insurance companies have issued $142 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at March 31, 2016. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.As of March 31, 2016, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies of which approximately $3.4 billion is anticipated to be paid in 2017; of this amount, $0.7 billion was paid in April 2017.50Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to Celesio was $1.41 billion at March 31, 2016, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.28 billion. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement on December 2, 2014, the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio received a put right that enables them to put their Celesio shares to McKesson at €22.99 per share, which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published by the German Bundesbank semiannually, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid (“Put Amount”). The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the Put Amount are uncertain. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per Celesio share (the “Compensation Amount”) to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio under the Domination Agreement, which became effective in December 2014. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. The Domination Agreement does not have an expiration date and can be terminated by McKesson without cause in writing no earlier than March 31, 2020. Refer to Financial Note 10, “Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 16, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 26, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.51Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. At March 31, 2016, we had $35 million in outstanding debt with variable interest rates. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2016, we had $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2016 and 2015 of approximately $26 million and $19 million.Foreign exchange risk: We conduct our business worldwide in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in U.S. dollars. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. We have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps. The forward contracts and cross currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk.As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $131 million and $223 million. However, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Refer to Financial Note 20, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps.The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.52Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:40.642296

Revenues for 2017 also increased due to our 2017 acquisitions including UDG Healthcare Plc (“UDG”), Biologics, Inc. (“Biologics”), Vantage Oncology Holdings, LLC (“Vantage”) and Rexall Health. Market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion.Gross profit decreased 1% in 2017 and was flat in 2016 compared to the same periods a year ago. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 1% and 4%, gross profit remained flat in 2017 and increased 4% in 2016. Gross profit margin decreased in 2017 primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, the competitive sell-side pricing environment, our mix of business and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. These decreases were partially offset by our acquisitions, LIFO inventory credits, higher cash receipts from antitrust legal settlements and benefits from our global procurement arrangements. Gross profit margin decreased in 2016 primarily due to a lower sell margin within our North America distribution business driven by increased customer sales volume with some of our largest customers, partially offset by higher buy margin including benefits from our global procurement arrangements, lower LIFO-related inventory charges and higher cash receipts from antitrust legal settlements. Gross profit included LIFO-related inventory credits of $7 million in 2017 and charges of $244 million and $337 million in 2016 and 2015. LIFO credits were recognized in 2017 primarily due to the impact of lower price increases. Gross profit for 2017 and 2016 also included $144 million and $76 million of cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. During 2017 and 2016, our Distribution Solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, which are expected to continue in 2018. 32Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Operating expenses decreased 47% and 7% in 2017 and 2016 compared to the same periods a year ago. Excluding favorable foreign currency effects of 2% and 5%, operating expenses decreased 45% and 2% in 2017 and 2016. Operating expenses decreased in 2017 primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million (after-tax gain of $3,018 million) recognized from the deconsolidation of the majority of our Technology Solutions businesses (“Core MTS Business”), as further described below.On June 28, 2016, we entered into a Contribution Agreement with Change, and others including shareholders of Change to form a joint venture, Change Healthcare. On March 1, 2017, the transaction closed upon satisfaction of all closing conditions pursuant to the Contribution Agreement. Under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, we contributed the majority of our Core MTS Business to the joint venture. We retained our RelayHealth Pharmacy and EIS businesses. We accounted for this transaction as a sale of the Core MTS Business and a subsequent purchase of a 70% interest in the newly formed joint venture. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we deconsolidated the Core MTS Business and recorded a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million (after-tax gain of $3,018 million). The pre-tax gain was calculated based on the difference between the fair value of our 70% equity interest in the joint venture, less the carrying amount of the contributed Core MTS Business’ net assets of $1,132 million and $1,258 million of promissory notes, a $136 million liability associated with a tax receivable agreement and transaction and other related expenses. The $1,258 million of promissory notes were subsequently repaid in cash from proceeds of Change Healthcare’s long term debt issuance. The gain is subject to final net working capital and other adjustments within 90 days from the transaction close date and is recorded in operating expenses within our Technology Solutions segment. Our investment in Change Healthcare is accounted for using the equity method of accounting on a one-month reporting lag. We disclose intervening events at the joint venture in the lag period that could materially affect our consolidated financial statements, if applicable. In March 2017, our proportionate share of transaction expenses incurred by the joint venture is estimated to be approximately $80 million to $120 million. However, due to the timing of the transaction and the one-month reporting lag, no net income or loss from our investment was recorded in our financial results for 2017. Commencing April 1, 2017, our proportionate share of the net income or loss from the joint venture including these transaction expenses will be recorded in “Other Income, Net” in our consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Excluding the gain on Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, 2017 operating expenses increased primarily due to a non-cash pre-tax charge of $290 million ($282 million after-tax) for goodwill impairment related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment and higher expenses due to our 2017 acquisitions. In connection with the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, we are evaluating strategic options for our EIS business. 2017 operating expenses benefited from lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with a cost alignment plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and ongoing expense management efforts. 2016 operating expenses decreased primarily due to pre-tax gains of $103 million from the sale of two businesses and lower acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by pre-tax restructuring charges of $203 million relating to the 2016 cost alignment plan. Additionally, 2015 operating expenses included a pre-tax and after-tax $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various U.S. Attorney’s offices. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased in 2017 and 2016 compared with the prior years primarily due to lower operating expenses. Our reported income tax rates were 23.4%, 27.9% and 30.7% in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Income tax expense for 2017 included discrete income tax benefits of $54 million related to the early adoption of the amended accounting guidance on share-based compensation. In 2017, we sold various software and ancillary intellectual property relating to our Technology Solutions business between wholly owned legal entities within the McKesson group that are based in different tax jurisdictions and recognized a net tax benefit of $137 million prior to the contribution of these assets to Change Healthcare. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2017 includes an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $113 million resulting from the 2017 first quarter sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and for 2015, included pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $241 million ($235 million after-tax) associated with the same Brazilian business. Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $5,070 million, $2,258 million and $1,476 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from continuing operations were $23.28, $9.84 33Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)and $7.54. Diluted loss per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from discontinued operations were $0.55, $0.14 and $1.27 in 2017, 2016 and 2015.On April 3, 2017, we completed our acquisition of CoverMyMeds LLC (“CMM”) for $1.3 billion and up to an additional $0.2 billion of contingent consideration payable based on CMM’s financial performance through the end of 2019. CMM provides electronic prior authorization solutions and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.

Distribution SolutionsNorth America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth, higher revenues associated with our 2017 acquisitions including Biologics, Vantage and Rexall Health, and expanded business with existing customers. These increases were partially offset by customer losses. Market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 6% in 2017 and decreased 11% in 2016. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 5% and 12%, revenues increased 11% and 1% in 2017 and 2016. Revenues increased in 2017 primarily due to market growth and our acquisition of UDG. Revenue growth for 2016 primarily reflected increased revenues in the United Kingdom due to a new distribution agreement with a manufacturer, which was almost fully offset by lower revenues in Norway associated with the loss of a hospital contract. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth. Revenues for 2017 also benefited from an acquisition and for 2016 were unfavorably affected by the sale of our ZEE Medical business in the second quarter of 2016. Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions revenues for 2017 decreased primarily due to one less month of revenues from the Core MTS Business, which was contributed to Change Healthcare on March 1, 2017. Revenues decreased over the last two years primarily due to a decline in hospital software revenues, partially offset by higher revenues in our other businesses. Additionally, 2016 revenues decreased as a result of the sale of our nurse triage business and the transition of our workforce business within our International Technology business to a third party during the first quarter of 2016.34Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2017 2016 2015 2017 2016Gross Profit Distribution Solutions (1) (2)$9,856 $9,948 $9,937 (1)% —%Technology Solutions (2)1,415 1,468 1,474 (4) — Total$11,271 $11,416 $11,411 (1)% —% Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions5.03% 5.29% 5.65% (26)bp (36)bp Technology Solutions54.21 50.88 48.03 333 285 Total5.68 5.98 6.37 (30) (39) bp - basis points(1)Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit includes LIFO credits of $7 million in 2017 and LIFO charges of $244 million and $337 million in 2016 and 2015.

Excluding unfavorable foreign currency effects of 2% and 4%, gross profit increased 1% and 4% in 2017 and 2016. Gross profit margin for 2017 decreased primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, the competitive sell-side pricing environment and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business, partially offset by LIFO inventory credits, higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements, higher global procurement benefits and our 2017 acquisitions. Gross profit for 2017 also reflects the impact of previously announced customer consolidation activity. Gross profit margin for 2016 decreased primarily due to a lower sell margin within our North America distribution business driven by increased customer sales volume with some of our largest customers, partially offset by lower LIFO inventory charges. Gross profit margin over the last two years was favorably affected by benefits from our global procurement arrangements and higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers, including the effects of price increases of both branded and generic drugs. During 2017 and 2016, our Distribution Solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, which are expected to continue in 2018. Our LIFO inventory credits were $7 million in 2017 and LIFO charges were $244 million and $337 million in 2016 and 2015. Our North America distribution business uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The business’ practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the net impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the net impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. Our annual LIFO charge is affected by changes in year-end inventory quantities, product mix and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be influenced by market and other external factors. Changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual LIFO credits or expense. LIFO credits were recognized in 2017 and LIFO charge decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the impact of lower price increases. As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. 35Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions segment’s gross profit decreased in 2017 and remained flat in 2016. Gross profit for 2017 decreased due to one less month of gross profit from the Core MTS Business, which was contributed to the joint venture on March 1, 2017. This segment’s gross profit margin increased over the last two years. Gross profit margin for 2017 increased primarily due to a decline in hospital software revenues, lower severance charges, ongoing cost management efforts and the prior year sales of businesses, partially offset by a lower margin from our hospital software business. Gross profit margin for 2017 also benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expenses related to the Core MTS Business’ assets, which were classified as held for sale since the second quarter of 2017. Depreciation and amortization related to the long-lived assets ceased as of the date they were determined as held for sale. Gross profit margin for 2016 benefited from the sale of our nurse triage business, transitioning of our workforce business within our International Technology business to a third party, and higher pull-through of deferred revenue. These increases were partially offset by $49 million of pre-tax severance charges including charges associated with the 2016 cost alignment plan. Additionally, in 2015 we recorded a $34 million pre-tax non-cash charge representing a catch-up in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our workforce business within our International Technology business. This business, which was previously designated as a discontinued operation, was reclassified to a continuing operation in 2015 when we decided to retain the business.

We expect to incur a total of $250 million to $270 million of pre-tax charges under this plan, of which $243 million primarily representing employee severance costs had been recorded from the inception of the plan through March 31, 2017. Estimated remaining charges primarily consist of exit-related costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization, which are largely attributed to our Distribution Solutions segment. The 2016 cost alignment plan generated approximately $170 million to $190 million of net pre-tax savings during 2017. We anticipate the 2016 cost alignment plan to generate an incremental $70 million to $90 million of net pre-tax savings during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018. Additional information on our cost alignment plan is included in Financial Note 6, “Restructuring” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Distribution SolutionsDistribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses increased 2% in 2017 and decreased 7% compared to the same periods a year ago. Excluding favorable foreign currency effects of 3% and 5%, operating expenses increased 5% in 2017 and decreased 2% in 2016. Operating expenses increased in 2017 primarily due to our acquisitions and higher acquisition-related expenses and intangible amortization, partially offset by lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with the 2016 cost alignment plan, ongoing expense management efforts, a pre-tax gain from the sale of a business recorded in 2016 and lower bad debt expense. Operating expense decreased in 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower acquisition-related expenses relating to integration activities for our acquisitions and the sale of our ZEE Medical business, including a pre-tax gain of $52 million. These decreases were partially offset by pre-tax charges of $156 million associated with the 2016 cost alignment plan, higher compensation and benefit costs and bad debt expense. Operating expenses for 2015 included a $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims. Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2017 primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million (after-tax gain of $3,018 million) from the deconsolidation of the Core MTS Business. Excluding the gain on Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, this segment’s operating expenses increased primarily due to a non-cash pre-tax charge of $290 million ($282 million after-tax) for the EIS goodwill impairment charge, partially offset by cost savings from the 2016 cost alignment plan and ongoing cost management efforts and one less month of expenses from the Core MTS Business. Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in 2016 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the sale of our nurse triage business in the first quarter of 2016, including a pre-tax gain of $51 million, and lower compensation and benefit costs. These decreases were partially offset by pre-tax charges of $30 million for the 2016 cost alignment plan as well as the write-off of internal-use software. CorporateCorporate expenses decreased 17% in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with the 2016 cost alignment plan, including lower compensation and benefit costs and outside service fees. Corporate expenses for 2017 also benefited from a pre-tax gain of $15 million from the sale-leaseback transaction of our corporate headquarters building. Corporate expenses increased in 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to pre-tax charges of $17 million associated with the 2016 cost alignment plan, partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses and a decrease in compensation and benefit costs. 37Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Acquisition Expenses and Related AdjustmentsAcquisition expenses and related adjustments include transaction, integration and other expenses that are directly related to business acquisitions and Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange including gain recognized from the transaction. In addition to a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million from the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, we recorded acquisition-related expenses of $151 million, $114 million and $224 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Expenses in 2017 were higher primarily due to our business acquisitions of UDG, Vantage, Biologics and Rexall Health, partially offset by a decline in expenses associated with our February 2014 acquisition of Celesio and February 2013 acquisition of PSS World Medical, Inc. (“PSSI”). Our integration of PSSI and Celesio were substantially completed in the first quarter of 2017.

We did not incur any material expenses associated with these two acquisitions in 2017. These expenses primarily include restructuring, severance, employee retention incentives, outside service fees and other costs to integrate the business, and bridge loan fees. Additionally, our acquisition-related expenses for our PSSI acquisition include amounts associated with distribution center rationalization and information technology conversions to common platforms. Integration activities for our PSSI and Celesio acquisitions were substantially completed in 2017. Amortization Expenses of Acquired Intangible AssetsAmortization expenses of acquired intangible assets in connection with acquisitions recorded in operating expenses were $440 million, $423 million and $483 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expenses increased in 2017 primarily due to our acquisitions of UDG, Biologics, Vantage and Rexall Health, partially offset by lower amortization expense related to Core MTS Business assets which were classified as held for sale since the 2017 second quarter. Amortization expense for 2016 decreased due to foreign currency effects and intangible assets that were fully amortized. 38Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Amortization expense recorded in operating expenses by segment was as follows: Years Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions)2017 2016 2015Distribution Solutions418 $389 $442Technology Solutions22 34 40Corporate— — 1Total$440 $423 $483Other Income, Net: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2017 2016 2015 2017 2016Distribution Solutions$64 $41 $48 56% (15)%Technology Solutions1 2 3 (50) (33) Corporate25 15 12 67 25 Total$90 $58 $63 55% (8)%Other income, net for 2017 increased 55% primarily due to higher equity investment income within our Distribution Solutions segment.

Segment operating profit for 2017 includes pre-tax restructuring charges of $19 million and $5 million in our Distribution Solutions segment and Corporate expenses, net, and pre-tax credits of $10 million associated with the 2016 cost alignment plan. (3)Technology Solutions segment’s operating profit for 2017 includes a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million from the deconsolidation of the Core MTS Business and a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $290 million related to our EIS business. Segment Operating ProfitDistribution Solutions: Operating profit margin decreased for 2017 primarily due to a decline in gross profit margin reflecting weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, the competitive sell-side pricing environment and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. Operating profit and operating profit margin in 2017 benefited from LIFO credits, our acquisitions, lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with the 2016 cost alignment plan and higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. Operating profit and operating profit margin for 2016 increased due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin. Operating profit and operating profit margin in 2016 includes $161 million of pre-tax charges associated with the Cost Alignment Plan, lower LIFO charges, and a $52 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our ZEE Medical business. Operating profit and operating profit margin for 2015 included a $150 million charge related to our controlled substance distribution claims. Technology Solutions: Operating profit and operating profit margin increased in 2017 primarily due to a $3,947 million pre-tax gain from the deconsolidation of the Core MTS Business in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was partially offset by the non-cash EIS goodwill impairment pre-tax charge of $290 million. 2017 operating profit benefited from lower restructuring charges and cost savings from the 2016 cost alignment plan. Operating profit for 2017 was unfavorably affected by one less month of gross profit from the Core MTS business, which was contributed to Change Healthcare on March 1, 2017. Operating profit margin increased in 2016 primarily due to higher gross profit margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Operating profit and operating profit margin for 2016 included a $51 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our nurse triage business and $51 million of pre-tax charges associated with the 2016 cost alignment plan.Corporate: Corporate expenses, net, decreased in 2017 primarily due to lower restructuring charges and a pre-tax gain from a sale-leaseback transaction. Corporate expenses, net increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher operating expenses as previously discussed.Interest Expense: Interest expense decreased in 2017 primarily due to repayments of debt, partially offset by an increase relating to the issuance of commercial paper. Interest expense decreased in 2016 primarily due to repayments of debt and certain foreign currency-denominated credit facilities.40Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees. Income TaxesDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, income tax expense related to continuing operations was $1,614 million, $908 million and $815 million, which included net discrete tax benefits of $82 million, $42 million and $33 million. Our discrete tax benefit for 2017 includes a tax benefit of $54 million related to the adoption of the amended accounting guidance on employee share-based compensation. Our reported income tax rates were 23.4%, 27.9% and 30.7% in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates, discrete items and for 2017 also due to the impact of the intercompany sale of software. The non-cash pre-tax charge of $290 million to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment, described in Financial Note 3, “Goodwill Impairment,” had an unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate in 2017 given that the majority of this charge was not deductible for tax purposes.On December 19, 2016, we sold various software and ancillary intellectual property relating to our Technology Solutions business between wholly owned legal entities within the McKesson group that are based in different tax jurisdictions. The transferor entity recognized a gain on the sale of assets that was not subject to income tax in its local jurisdiction; such gain was eliminated upon consolidation. An entity based in the U.S. was the recipient of the software and ancillary intellectual property and is entitled to amortize the fair value of the assets for book and tax purposes. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the tax benefit associated with the amortization of these assets is recognized over the tax lives of the assets. As a result, a net tax benefit of $137 million was recognized prior to the contribution of a portion of these assets to Change Healthcare as described in Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange”. On March 1, 2017, we contributed assets to Change Healthcare as further described in Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange”. While this transaction was predominantly structured as a tax free asset contribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 721(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, we recorded tax expense of $929 million on the gain. The tax expense was primarily driven by the recognition of a deferred tax liability on the excess book over tax basis in our equity investment in Change Healthcare.Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. During the first quarter of 2017, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to settle all outstanding issues relating to the fiscal years 2007 through 2009. This settlement did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes. We received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency related to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2013. During 2016, we reached an agreement to settle the transfer pricing matter for years 2003 through 2013 and recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $8 million.Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxLosses from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $124 million, $32 million and $299 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015.Loss from discontinued operations, net for 2017 includes an after-tax loss of $113 million related to the sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business within our Distribution Solutions segment, which we acquired through our February 2014 acquisition of Celesio. In 2015, we committed to a plan to sell this business and the results of operations and cash flows for this business had been classified as discontinued operations since 2015. On May 31, 2016, we completed the sale of this business and recognized the loss primarily for the settlement of certain indemnification matters as well as the release of the cumulative translation losses. We made a payment of approximately $100 million related to the sale.41Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Loss from discontinued operations, net for 2015 included pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $241 million ($235 million after-tax), which were recorded to reduce the carrying value of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. Loss from discontinued operations, net for 2015 also included a pre-tax and after-tax loss of $6 million from the sale of a software business within our International Technology business. Refer to Financial Note 5, “Discontinued Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for all periods presented includes the guaranteed dividend or annual recurring compensation that we are obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio AG under the profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”). In 2017, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes third-party equity interests in our consolidated entities including Vantage and ClarusOne Sourcing Services LLC, which was established between McKesson and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within the Company’s control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of Stockholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial Note 11, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation: Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $5,070 million, $2,258 million and $1,476 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and diluted earnings per common share were $22.73, $9.70 and $6.27. Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 223 million, 233 million and 235 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding is affected by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and in 2017 and 2016, the cumulative effect of share repurchases.Foreign OperationsOur foreign operations represented approximately 17%, 17% and 20% of our consolidated revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency effect”, which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In computing foreign currency effect, we translate our current year results in local currencies into U.S dollars by applying average foreign exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods in U.S. dollars. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in Financial Note 29, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Business CombinationsRefer to Financial Notes 4 and 17, “Business Combinations” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.2018 OutlookInformation regarding the Company’s 2018 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 22, 2017. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.42Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes general and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2017, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) accounted for approximately 54.2% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 20.2% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2017, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 33.7% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS were approximately 17.8% of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2017 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future.At March 31, 2017, trade and notes receivables were $14,717 million prior to allowances of $243 million. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our provision for bad debts was $93 million, $113 million and $67 million. At March 31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.7% and 1.4%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2017 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $15 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”). Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $15.3 billion at March 31, 2017 and 2016. 43Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The LIFO method was used to value approximately 70% and 74% of our inventories at March 31, 2017 and 2016. If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately $1,005 million and $1,012 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2017 and 2016. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. We recognized net LIFO credits of $7 million in 2017 and net LIFO charges of $244 million and $337 million in 2016 and 2015 within our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 4, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $10,586 million and $9,786 million of goodwill at March 31, 2017 and 2016 and $3,665 million and $3,021 million of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2017 and 2016. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.44Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangibles assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Under the income approach, the fair value estimates in the goodwill impairment analysis are highly sensitive to the discount rates used in the discounting of expected cash flows attributable to the reporting units. The discount rates are the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting units’ cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues, earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. In 2016 and 2015, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. In 2017, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $290 million ($282 million after-tax) to impair the carrying value of our EIS business. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. Our Celesio reporting unit within our Distribution Solutions segment experienced a decline in its estimated future cash flows primarily driven by government reimbursement reductions in our U.K. retail business. The decline in estimated future cash flows resulted in the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeding the carrying value of the reporting unit by 13%. The goodwill balance of this reporting unit was $2,790 million at March 31, 2017 or approximately 26% of the total distribution segment’s goodwill balance. A further decrease in the estimated future cash flows, an increase in the discount rate and/ or a decrease in the terminal growth rate, could result in a goodwill impairment for this reporting unit. The discount rate and terminal growth rate used in our 2017 annual impairment testing for this reporting unit were 7% and 1.5%. Currently, all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 38 years. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. There were no material impairments of intangibles in 2017, 2016 or 2015 within our continuing operations. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.45Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, supplier reserves were $201 million and $144 million. The final outcome of any outstanding claims may differ from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2017 and 2016 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2017 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $31 million in 2017. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,156 million and $1,272 million and deferred tax liabilities of $4,806 million and $3,947 million at March 31, 2017 and 2016. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences relating to our compensation and benefit related accruals and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities have been established primarily due to excess book over tax basis in inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO), intangible assets and our investment in Change Healthcare. Valuation allowances of $503 million and $267 million exist at March 31, 2017 and 2016 against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 1% in our 2017 effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes of approximately $69 million for 2017. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. 46Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time to time. We are in the process of acquiring certain businesses, and the cost of these acquisitions may be partially funded through the issuance of debt.Net cash flow from operating activities was $4,744 million in 2017 compared to $3,672 million in 2016 and $3,112 million in 2015. Operating activities over the last three years were primarily affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements and vendor payment terms. Operating activities for 2017 were also affected by $150 million of litigation settlement payment. Net cash used in investing activities was $3,796 million in 2017 compared to $1,557 million in 2016 and $677 million in 2015. Investing activities for 2017 include $4,237 million of net cash payments for acquisitions including $2.1 billion for our acquisition of Rexall, $1,228 million of net payments received on Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, $404 million and $158 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $206 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and other assets. Additionally, we prepaid $1.4 billion for acquisitions that closed subsequent to year end. Investing activities for 2016 included $40 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, $488 million and $189 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $210 million of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and an equity investment. Investing activities for 2015 included $170 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $4,497 million for our acquisition of Celesio. Investing activities in 2015 also included $376 million and $169 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $15 million of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and equity investment. Financing activities utilized $2,069 million, $3,453 million and $968 million of cash in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Financing activities for 2017 include cash receipts of $8,294 million and payments of $8,124 million from short-term borrowings. We received cash from long-term debt issuances of $1,824 million and made repayments on long-term debt of $1,601 million in 2017. Financing activities in 2017 also include $2,250 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $253 million of dividends paid. Financing activities for 2016 include cash receipts of $1,561 million and payments of $1,688 million from short-term borrowings. We made repayments on long-term debt of $1,598 million in 2016. Financing activities in 2016 also include $1,504 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $244 million of dividends paid.Financing activities for 2015 include cash receipts of $3,100 million and cash paid of $3,152 million from short-term borrowings. Long-term debt repayments in 2015 were primarily cash paid on promissory notes. Financing activities in 2015 also reflect a cash payment of $32 million to acquire approximately 1 million additional common shares of Celesio through the tender offers we completed in 2015. Additionally, financing activities for 2015 include $340 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $227 million of dividends paid. 47Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. The Board authorized the repurchase of the Company’s common stock up to $4 billion in October 2016. In 2017, we repurchased 14.1 million of our shares through open market transactions and 1.4 million of our shares through an ASR program. In 2016, we repurchased 8.7 million of our shares through both an ASR program and open market transactions.

However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions)2017 2016 2015Cash and cash equivalents$2,783 $4,048 $5,341 Working capital1,336 3,366 3,173 Debt to capital ratio (1)39.2% 43.6% 50.3%Return on McKesson stockholders’ equity (2)54.6 26.0 17.0 (1)Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).(2)Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in Euros, AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling, U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government. The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2017 included approximately $2.3 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations and acquisitions. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. 48Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance and an increase in drafts and accounts payable and deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by increases in receivables. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2016 compared to March 31, 2015 primarily due to increases in receivables and inventories and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable. Our debt to capital ratio improved for 2017 primarily due to an increase in stockholders’ equity and for 2016 primarily due to a decrease in our debt. In July 2015, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.24 to $0.28 per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board. Dividends were $1.12 per share in 2017, $1.08 per share in 2016 and $0.96 per share in 2015. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we paid total cash dividends of $253 million, $244 million and $227 million. Additionally, as required under the Domination Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per Celesio share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio.Contractual Obligations:The table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2017: Years(In millions)Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5On balance sheet Long-term debt (1)$8,362 $1,057 $1,514 $1,246 $4,545Other (2) 477 42 208 68 159 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3)2,911 285 452 371 1,803Purchase obligations (4)3,250 3,196 41 13 —Operating lease obligations (5) 2,633 477 729 495 932Other (6)324 190 24 18 92Total$17,957 $5,247 $2,968 $2,211 $7,531(1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations.

The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.49Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)At March 31, 2017, we have recorded a $136 million noncurrent liability payable to Change Healthcare shareholders associated with a tax receivable entered into in connection with Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. The amount is based on certain estimates and could become payable in periods after a disposition of our investment in Change Healthcare.Our banks and insurance companies have issued $255 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at March 31, 2017. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.The carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to Celesio was $1.33 billion at March 31, 2017, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.21 billion. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement on December 2, 2014, the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio received a put right that enables them to put their Celesio shares to McKesson at €22.99 per share, which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published by the German Bundesbank semiannually, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid (“Put Amount”). The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the Put Amount are uncertain. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per Celesio share (the “Compensation Amount”) to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio under the Domination Agreement, which became effective in December 2014. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. The Domination Agreement does not have an expiration date and can be terminated by McKesson without cause in writing no earlier than March 31, 2020. Refer to Financial Note 11, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 17, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 27, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.50Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $2.8 billion and $4.0 billion and in cash and cash equivalents. The effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2017 and 2016 of approximately $19 million and $26 million.Foreign exchange risk: We conduct our business worldwide in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in U.S. dollars. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. We have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps. The forward contracts and cross currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk.As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $357 million and $131 million. However, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Refer to Financial Note 21, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps.The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.51Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:41.364053

These increases for 2018 and 2017 were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion and loss of customers and for 2018 also by the contribution of the majority of our McKesson Technology Solutions businesses (“Core MTS Business”) to a joint venture in March 2017, as further discussed below. 33Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2018 and 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The decrease for 2018 was primarily due to the contribution of the Core MTS Business, significant government reimbursement reductions in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), the competitive sell-side environment and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends. These decreases in 2018 were partially offset by market growth, procurement benefits realized through the joint sourcing entity, ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP (“ClarusONE”), higher last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) credits and our business acquisitions. Gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2017 primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, the competitive sell-side pricing environment, our mix of business and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. These decreases for 2017 were partially offset by our business acquisitions, LIFO inventory credits, higher cash receipts from antitrust legal settlements and higher procurement benefits. Gross profit for 2017 and 2016 benefited from $144 million and $76 million of cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. LIFO credits were $99 million and $7 million in 2018 and 2017 and LIFO charges were $244 million in 2016. LIFO credits were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher net effect of price declines, partially offset by the lower inventory level. LIFO expense was recognized in 2016 primarily due to net effects of price increases. Our Distribution Solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends over the last three years.On March 1, 2017, we contributed our Core MTS Business to the newly formed joint venture, Change Healthcare, LLC (“Change Healthcare”) under the terms of a contribution agreement entered into between McKesson and Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (“Change”) and others including shareholders of Change. We retained our RelayHealth Pharmacy (“RHP”) and Enterprise Information Solutions (“EIS”) businesses. The RHP business was transferred to our MDS segment, effective April 1, 2017, and the EIS business was sold to a third party in the third quarter of 2018. We accounted for this transaction as a sale of the Core MTS Business and a subsequent purchase of a 70% interest in the newly formed joint venture. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. Total operating expenses increased in 2018 and decreased in 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million (after-tax gain of $3,018 million) recognized in 2017 from the contribution of the Core MTS Business. 2018 total operating expenses also increased due to:•Total non-cash goodwill impairment charges (pre-tax and after-tax) of $1,738 million for our McKesson Europe AG (“McKesson Europe”) and Rexall Health reporting units, as further described below. The charges were recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. There were no tax benefits associated with these goodwill impairment charges.•Non-cash pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges of $446 million ($410 million after-tax) and pre-tax restructuring charges of $74 million ($67 million after-tax) primarily representing employee severance and lease exit costs for our McKesson Europe business; •Higher expenses due to our business acquisitions; and •Pre-tax charitable contribution expense of $100 million ($64 million after-tax) to a public benefit California foundation (“Foundation”), as further described below. These increases in 2018 total operating expenses were partially offset by a pre-tax gain of $109 million (after-tax gain of $30 million) from the 2018 third quarter sale of our EIS business in our Technology Solutions segment.Excluding the gain on Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, 2017 total operating expenses increased primarily due to a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million ($282 million after-tax) related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment and higher expenses due to our business acquisitions. 2017 total operating expenses benefited from lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with a cost alignment plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and ongoing expense management efforts. 34Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Our investment in Change Healthcare is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. During 2018, we recorded our proportionate share of loss from Change Healthcare of $248 million under the caption, “Loss from Equity Method Investment in Change Healthcare,” in our consolidated statements of operations. We recorded our proportionate share of a provisional net benefit recognized by Change Healthcare from the enactment of the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) of $76 million primarily due to a reduction in future applicable tax rate. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $122 million ($78 million after-tax) on debt extinguishment related to our February 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing outstanding long-term debt. Refer to Financial Note 16, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased in 2018 and increased in 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to the pre-tax gain recognized in 2017 from the contribution of the Core MTS Business. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased in 2018 also due to the goodwill impairment charges within our Distribution Solutions segment, the restructuring and asset impairment charges, our proportionate share of loss from our equity method investment in Change Healthcare and loss on debt extinguishment. Our reported income tax benefit rate was 22.2% in 2018 and income tax expense rates were 23.4% and 27.9% in 2017 and 2016. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to change in tax laws, including the recently enacted 2017 Tax Act, the impact of nondeductible impairment charges and varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have income tax rates different from the U.S. rate. During 2018, as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we have recognized a provisional tax benefit of $1,324 million due to the re-measurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower U.S. federal tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $457 million for the one-time tax imposed on certain accumulated earnings and profits (“E&P”) of our foreign subsidiaries. Refer to Financial Note 10, “Income Taxes,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2017 includes an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $113 million resulting from the 2017 first quarter sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business. Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $67 million, $5,070 million and $2,258 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from continuing operations were $0.30, $23.28 and $9.84. Diluted income (loss) per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from discontinued operations were $0.02, ($0.55) and ($0.14) in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Additionally, our 2018 diluted earnings per share reflect the cumulative effects of share repurchases. FoundationDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Foundation was established to provide opioid education to patients, caregivers, and providers, address policy issues, and increase patient access to life-saving treatments. In March 2018, we made a pledge to the Foundation and incurred a pre-tax charitable contribution expense of $100 million ($64 million after-tax) for 2018, which was recorded in operating expenses within Corporate Expenses. The pledge is binding and enforceable and is expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2019. Goodwill Impairments McKesson Europe: In 2018, we recorded total non-cash pre-tax and after-tax charges of $1,283 million to impair the carrying value of goodwill for our McKesson Europe reporting unit.35Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)During the second quarter of 2018, our McKesson Europe reporting unit had a decline in its estimated future cash flows, primarily in our United Kingdom (“U.K.”) retail business, driven by significant government reimbursement reductions affecting retail pharmacy economics across the U.K. market. As a result, we performed the interim impairment test in the second quarter of 2018 and recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $350 million (pre-tax and after-tax). During the fourth quarter of 2018, this reporting unit had a further decline in its estimated future cash flows driven by weakening script growth projections in our U.K. business and by a more competitive environment in France. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, we recorded non-cash charges of $933 million (pre-tax and after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2018 to impair this reporting unit’s goodwill balance. The discount rates and terminal growth rates were 7.5% and 1.25% for the 2018 second quarter interim test and 8.0% and 1.25% for the 2018 annual test, compared to 7.0% and 1.5% in our 2017 annual impairment test. At March 31, 2018, this reporting unit had a remaining goodwill balance of $1,851 million. Rexall Health: As a result of the 2018 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge (pre-tax and after-tax) of $455 million in 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018, this reporting unit had a decline in its estimated future cash flows primarily driven by significant generics reimbursement reductions across Canada and minimum wage increases in multiple provinces which can only be partially mitigated through the business’ cost saving efforts. The discount rate and terminal growth rate used in the annual impairment testing were 10.0% and 2.0%. At March 31, 2018, the Rexall Health reporting unit had no remaining goodwill related to our acquisition of Rexall Health.Other risks, expenses and future developments that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing dates in 2018 may require us to further revise the estimated future cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our reporting units in future periods. As a result, we may be required to record additional impairment charges. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Goodwill Impairment Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Restructuring and Asset ImpairmentsMcKesson Europe: Due to the previously described decline in future estimated cash flows related to our U.K. retail business, we also recorded total non-cash pre-tax charges of $189 million ($157 million after-tax) to impair the carrying value of certain intangible assets (primarily pharmacy licenses) and store assets during the second quarter of 2018. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2018, due to further declines in estimated future cash flows in our European business, we also recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $257 million ($253 million after-tax) to impair the carrying value of certain intangible assets (primarily customer relationships) and capitalized software assets. On September 29, 2017, we committed to a restructuring plan, which primarily consists of the closures or sales of underperforming retail stores in the U.K. and a reduction in workforce. The plan is expected to be substantially implemented prior to the first half of 2019. As part of this plan, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $74 million ($67 million after-tax) in operating expenses during 2018 primarily representing employee severance and lease exit costs. Refer to Financial Note 4, “Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. 36Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Revenues: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Distribution Solutions North America pharmaceutical distribution& services$174,186 $164,832 $158,469 6% 4%International pharmaceutical distribution & services27,320 24,847 23,497 10 6 Medical-Surgical distribution & services6,611 6,244 6,033 6 3 Total Distribution Solutions208,117 195,923 187,999 6 4 Technology Solutions - products and services240 2,610 2,885 (91) (10) Total Revenues$208,357 $198,533 $190,884 5% 4%Revenues increased 5% and 4% in 2018 and 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago primarily driven by our Distribution Solutions segment. Distribution SolutionsNorth America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth, reflecting growing drug utilization, price increases, higher revenues associated with our acquisitions and expanded business with existing customers. These increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion and loss of customers. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 10% and 6% in 2018 and 2017. Excluding foreign currency effects, revenues increased 5% in 2018 and 11% in 2017 primarily due to our business acquisitions and market growth. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth. Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions revenues for 2018 and 2017 decreased primarily due to the 2017 fourth quarter contribution of the Core MTS Business to form the Change Healthcare joint venture, the April 2017 transition of our RHP business to our Distribution Solutions segment and the 2018 third quarter sale of our EIS business. As a result, this segment’s 2018 revenues included only our EIS business. 37Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions, except ratios)2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Gross Profit Distribution Solutions (1)$11,064 $9,856 $9,948 12% (1)%Technology Solutions 120 1,415 1,468 (92) (4) Total$11,184 $11,271 $11,416 (1)% (1)% Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions5.32% 5.03% 5.29% 29bp (26)bp Technology Solutions50.00 54.21 50.88 (421) 333 Total5.37 5.68 5.98 (31) (30) bp - basis points(1)Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit includes LIFO credits of $99 million and $7 million in 2018 and 2017 and LIFO charges of $244 million in 2016. Gross profit for 2017 and 2016 also includes $144 million and $76 million of net cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements.Gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2018 and 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The decreases in 2018 were primarily due the previously described contribution of our Core MTS Business to Change Healthcare. Distribution SolutionsDistribution Solutions segment’s gross profit increased 12% in 2018 and decreased 1% in 2017. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 29 bp in 2018 and decreased by 26 bp in 2017. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2018 increased compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to market growth, procurement benefits realized through ClarusONE, higher LIFO inventory credits, our business acquisitions and the transfer of our RHP business from our Technology Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by significant government reimbursement reductions in the U.K., the competitive sell-side pricing environment, weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends and our mix of business. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2017 decreased primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, the competitive sell-side pricing environment and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer in our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business, partially offset by LIFO inventory credits, higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements, higher procurement benefits and our business acquisitions. Gross profit also reflects the impact of recent customer consolidation activities. Our Distribution Solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends over the last three years. Our LIFO inventory credits were $99 million and $7 million in 2018 and 2017 and LIFO charges were $244 million in 2016. Our North America distribution business uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The business’ practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the net impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the net impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. Our annual LIFO charge or credit is affected by changes in year-end inventory quantities, product mix and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be influenced by market and other external factors. Changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual LIFO credit or expense. LIFO credits were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher net effect of price declines, partially offset by lower inventory level. LIFO expense was recognized in 2016 primarily due to net effects of price increases. As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO did not exceed current replacement cost. 38Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions segment’s gross profit decreased in 2018 and 2017. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2018 decreased primarily due to the 2017 fourth quarter contribution of the Core MTS Business, the transfer of our RHP business to our Distribution Solutions segment and the 2018 third quarter sale of our EIS business. As a result, this segment’s 2018 gross profit and gross profit margin included only our EIS business. Gross profit for 2017 decreased due to one less month of gross profit from the Core MTS Business, which was contributed to the joint venture on March 1, 2017. Gross profit margin for 2017 increased primarily due to a decline in hospital software revenues, lower severance charges, ongoing cost management efforts and the prior year sales of businesses, partially offset by a lower margin from our hospital software business. Gross profit margin for 2017 also benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expenses related to the Core MTS Business’ assets, which were classified as held for sale since the second quarter of 2017. Depreciation and amortization related to the long-lived assets ceased as of the date they were determined as held for sale. 39Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Operating Expenses, Other Income, Net and Loss from Equity Method Investment: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions, except ratios)2018 2017 2016 2018 2017Operating Expenses Distribution Solutions Operating Expenses (1)$7,648 $6,540 $6,280 17% 4%Goodwill impairment charges1,738 — — NM NM Restructuring and asset impairment charges567 19 156 2,884 (88) Total Distribution Solutions9,953 6,559 6,436 52% 2%Technology Solutions Operating Expenses (2)42 858 1,002 (95)% (14)%Gains from sales of businesses(109) — (51) NM NM Gain on healthcare technology net asset exchange, net(37) (3,947) — (99) NM Goodwill impairment charge— 290 — NM NM Total Technology Solutions(104) (2,799) 951 (96)% (394)%Corporate 573 402 484 43 (17) Total$10,422 $4,162 $7,871 150% (47)% Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Revenues Distribution Solutions4.78%3.35%3.42% 143bp (7)bp Technology Solutions(43.33) (107.24) 32.96 NM NM Total5.00 2.10 4.12 290 (202) Other Income, Net Distribution Solutions$120 $64 $41 88% 56%Technology Solutions1 1 2 - (50) Corporate9 25 15 (64) 67 Total$130 $90 $58 44% 55% Loss from Equity Method Investment in Change Healthcare - Technology Solutions$248 $— $— NM NM bp - basis pointsNM - not meaningful (1)The amounts exclude the goodwill impairment charges and restructuring and asset impairment charges. 2016 includes a pre-tax gain of $52 million from the 2016 third quarter sale of our ZEE Medical business.(2)The amounts exclude the gain from sale of business, gain on healthcare technology net asset exchange, net, and goodwill impairment charge.

The impairment was primarily due to the decline in the estimated future cash flows from certain pharmacies of Rexall Health’s business, driven primarily by generics reimbursement reductions implemented across Canada; and•Higher expenses due to our business acquisitions.We expect to record total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $90 million to $130 million for our McKesson Europe business, of which $74 million of pre-tax charges were recorded through the end of 2018. Estimated remaining restructuring charges primarily consist of lease termination and other exit costs.Total operating expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to our acquisitions and higher acquisition-related expenses and intangible amortization, partially offset by lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with the 2016 Cost Alignment Plan, ongoing expense management efforts and lower bad debt expense. Total operating expenses for 2016 include a pre-tax gain from the 2016 sale of a business. Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions segment had operating credits of $104 million and $2,799 million in 2018 and 2017 primarily due to gains that offset operating expenses. Total operating expenses for 2018 benefited from a pre-tax gain of $109 million (after-tax gain of $30 million) from the 2018 third quarter sale of our EIS business, a pre-tax credit of $46 million ($30 million after-tax) from the re-measurement of the liability related to a tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare shareholders and a pre-tax gain of $37 million (after-tax gain of $22 million) representing the final net working capital and other adjustments from the 2017 Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. On August 1, 2017, we entered into an agreement with a third party to sell our EIS business for $185 million, subject to adjustments for net debt and working capital. On October 2, 2017, the transaction closed upon satisfaction of all closing conditions including the termination of the waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws. We received net cash proceeds of $169 million after $16 million of assumed net debt by the third party. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $109 million (after-tax gain of $30 million) upon the disposition of this business in the third quarter of 2018 within operating expenses in our Technology Solutions segment.Total operating expenses for 2017 benefited from the pre-tax gain of $3,947 million (after-tax gain of $3,018 million) from the contribution of Core MTS Business, partially offset by a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million ($282 million after-tax) for the EIS reporting unit, cost savings from the 2016 Cost Alignment Plan and ongoing cost management efforts and one less month of expenses from the Core MTS Business.

Segment Operating Profit (Loss)Distribution Solutions: Operating profit and operating profit margin decreased for 2018 compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charges and restructuring and long-lived asset impairment charges related to our McKesson Europe and Rexall Health businesses. These decreases were partially offset by the improved gross profit margin primarily due to market growth within our North America distribution businesses, procurement benefits, our business acquisitions and higher LIFO credits. 2018 operating profit and operating profit margin were also unfavorably affected by government reimbursement reductions in the U.K. and the competitive sell-side pricing environment.Operating profit margin decreased for 2017 primarily due to a decline in gross profit margin reflecting weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, the competitive sell-side pricing environment and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. Operating profit and operating profit margin in 2017 benefited from LIFO credits, our acquisitions, lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with the 2016 Cost Alignment Plan and higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. 44Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Technology Solutions: Operating profit decreased for 2018 primarily due to the 2017 contribution of our Core MTS Business and loss from the equity method investment in Change Healthcare. The decrease is partially offset by a gain from the sale of our EIS business. Operating profit and operating profit margin increased in 2017 primarily due to the gain from the 2017 contribution of the Core MTS Business, which was partially offset by the non-cash EIS goodwill impairment pre-tax charge of $290 million. 2017 operating profit benefited from lower restructuring charges and cost savings from the 2016 Cost Alignment Plan. Operating profit for 2017 was unfavorably affected by one less month of operating profit from the Core MTS business, which was contributed to Change Healthcare on March 1, 2017. Corporate: Corporate expenses, net, increased for 2018 primarily due to higher operating expenses driven by a charitable contribution expense of $100 million, Corporate initiatives and lower other income compared to the same period a year ago. Corporate expenses, net, decreased in 2017 primarily due to lower restructuring charges and a pre-tax gain from a sale-leaseback transaction. Loss on Debt Extinguishment: We recognized a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of $122 million ($78 million after-tax) primarily representing premiums related to our February 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing outstanding long-term debt. Interest Expense: Interest expense over the last two years decreased primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase relating to the issuance of commercial paper. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.45Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Income Taxes During 2018, 2017 and 2016, our income tax benefit was $53 million and income tax expenses were $1,614 million and $908 million related to continuing operations. Our reported income tax benefit rate was 22.2% in 2018 and income tax expense rates were 23.4% and 27.9% in 2017 and 2016. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to change in tax laws, including the recently enacted 2017 Tax Act, the impact of nondeductible impairment charges and varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have income tax rates different from the U.S. rate. Our reported income tax benefit rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by the 2017 Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we recognized a provisional tax benefit of $1,324 million due to the re-measurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower U.S. federal tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $457 million for the one-time tax imposed on certain accumulated E&P of our foreign subsidiaries. Our reported income tax benefit rate for 2018 was unfavorably impacted by non-cash pre-tax charges totaling $1,738 million to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our McKesson Europe and Rexall Health reporting units within our Distribution Solutions segment, given that no tax benefit was recognized for these charges. Our reported income tax expense rate for 2017 was unfavorably affected by a non-cash pre-tax charge of $290 million to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment given that the majority of this charge was not deductible for income tax purposes. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Goodwill Impairment Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. On December 19, 2016, we sold various software relating to our Technology Solutions business between wholly owned legal entities within the McKesson group that are based in different tax jurisdictions. The transferor entity recognized a gain on the sale of assets that was not subject to income tax in its local jurisdiction; such gain was eliminated upon consolidation. An entity based in the U.S. was the recipient of the software and is entitled to amortize the fair value of the assets for book and tax purposes. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the tax benefit associated with the amortization of these assets is recognized over the tax lives of the assets. As a result, a net tax benefit of $137 million was recognized prior to the contribution of a portion of these assets to Change Healthcare as described in Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange”. In 2018, a net tax benefit of $178 million was recognized associated with the amortization of the software. In October 2016, amended guidance was issued to require entities to recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amended guidance is effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates recording approximately $130 million to $160 million of deferred tax assets with a corresponding cumulative-effect increase to retained earnings in the beginning of the period of adoption on its consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences relating to the intra-entity transfer of software. On March 1, 2017, we contributed assets to Change Healthcare as further described in Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange”. While this transaction was predominantly structured as a tax free asset contribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 721(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, we recorded tax expense of $929 million on the gain. The tax expense was primarily driven by the recognition of a deferred tax liability on the excess book over tax basis in our equity investment in Change Healthcare.Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.We signed the Revenue Agent’s Report from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) relating to their audit of the fiscal years 2010 through 2012 on December 29, 2017. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state and local jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to audit by the IRS for fiscal years 2013 through the current fiscal year. We are generally subject to audit by taxing authorities in various U.S. states and in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal years 2010 through the current fiscal year.46Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxIncome (Losses) from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $5 million, ($124 million) and ($32 million) in 2018, 2017 and 2016.Loss from discontinued operations, net for 2017 includes an after-tax loss of $113 million related to the sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business within our Distribution Solutions segment, which we acquired through our February 2014 acquisition of McKesson Europe. In 2015, we committed to a plan to sell this business and the results of operations and cash flows for this business had been classified as discontinued operations since 2015. On May 31, 2016, we completed the sale of this business and recognized the loss primarily for the settlement of certain indemnification matters as well as the release of the cumulative translation losses. We made a payment of approximately $100 million related to the sale in 2017. Refer to Financial Note 7, “Discontinued Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for all periods presented includes the annual recurring compensation that we are obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”). In 2018 and 2017, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes third-party equity interests in our consolidated entities including Vantage and ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP, which was established between McKesson and Walmart, Inc. in 2017. Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within the Company’s control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of Stockholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial Note 11, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation: Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $67 million, $5,070 million and $2,258 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and diluted earnings per common share were $0.32, $22.73 and $9.70. Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 209 million, 223 million and 233 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding is affected by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and in 2018 and 2017, and the cumulative effect of share repurchases.Foreign OperationsOur foreign operations represented approximately 18%, 17% and 17% of our consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency effect”, which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In computing foreign currency effect, we translate our current year results in local currencies into U.S dollars by applying average foreign exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods in U.S. dollars. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in Financial Note 28, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 47Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Business CombinationsRecently Announced Business Acquisition On April 25, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Medical Specialties Distributors LLC (“MSD”) for $800 million, which will be funded from cash on hand. MSD is a leading national distributor of infusion and medical-surgical supplies as well as provider of biomedical services to alternate site and home health providers. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close during the first half of 2019. Upon closing, the financial results of MSD will be included in our consolidated statements of operations within our Medical-Surgical Solutions business.Other Business AcquisitionsRefer to Financial Note 6, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Fiscal 2019 Operating SegmentsAs previously disclosed in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, the executive who was our segment manager of the Distribution Solutions segment retired from the Company in January 2018. As a result, the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluated our management and operating structure. In connection with the completion of this evaluation in the first quarter of 2019, our operating structure is realigned, and we will report our financial results in three reportable segments on a retrospective basis commencing in the first quarter of 2019, as follows: •U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions;•European Pharmaceutical Solutions; and•Medical-Surgical Solutions. All remaining operating segments and business activities that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure will be included in Other. Other primarily consists of McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and our equity method investment in Change Healthcare. The segment changes will reflect how our CODM allocates resources and assesses performance commencing in the first quarter of 2019. The segment changes will not affect the previously issued consolidated financial statements nor earnings per common share of McKesson for historical periods. Strategic Growth InitiativeOn April 25, 2018, the Company announced a multi-year strategic growth initiative, focused on creating innovative new solutions that improve patient care delivery and drive incremental profit growth. The initiative includes a comprehensive review of the Company’s operations and cost structure, designed to increase efficiency, accelerate execution and improve long-term performance. As part of the preliminary phase of this initiative, in April 2018, we committed to a restructuring plan to optimize our operating model and cost structure which will be substantially implemented by the end of 2019. We expect to record total after-tax charges of approximately $150 million to $210 million during 2019. The charges under this plan primarily consist of employee severance, exit-related costs and other charges.Fiscal 2019 OutlookInformation regarding the Company’s fiscal 2019 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 24, 2018. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.48Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes general and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2018, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) accounted for approximately 51.7% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 19.9% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2018, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 24.9% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS were approximately 16.4% of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2018 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future.At March 31, 2018, trade and notes receivables were $14,480 million prior to allowances of $187 million. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our provision for bad debts was $44 million, $93 million and $113 million. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.3% and 1.7%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2018 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $14 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst-case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Inventories: Prior to 2018, we reported inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Effective in the first quarter of 2018, we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the LIFO method. Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”). Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories, net were $16,310 million and $15,278 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017. 49Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The LIFO method was used to value approximately 63% and 70% of our inventories at March 31, 2018 and 2017. If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately $906 million and $1,005 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2018 and 2017. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. We recognized net LIFO credits of $99 million and $7 million in 2018 and 2017 and net LIFO charges of $244 million in 2016 within our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. In determining whether inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 6, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $10,924 million and $10,586 million of goodwill at March 31, 2018 and 2017, $4,102 million and $3,665 million of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2018 and 2017. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.In 2018, we elected to early adopt on a prospective basis, the amended guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the second step of the impairment test. The one-step impairment test under the amended guidance requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, if any. 50Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. For example, some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the DCF method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Under the income approach, the fair value estimates in the goodwill impairment analysis are highly sensitive to the discount rates used in the discounting of expected cash flows attributable to the reporting units. The discount rates are the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital. The unsystematic risk premium is an input factor used in calculating discount rate that specifically addresses uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections. Increases in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate. In 2016, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. In 2017, we recorded a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of our EIS reporting unit’s goodwill. In 2018, we recorded non-cash charges to impair the carrying value of goodwill balance for our McKesson Europe and Rexall Health reporting units. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Goodwill Impairment Charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Commencing in the first quarter of 2019, our operating structure will be realigned into three reportable segments, U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All remaining operating segments and business activities that are not significant enough to be reportable segments are combined into Other. This change in our operating segment structure will result in two new reporting units within the European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. As a result, we will be required to perform a goodwill impairment test for the impacted new reporting units immediately before and after the segment change. While we believe the assumptions used in our 2018 impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results for our 2018 reporting unit structure, we may recognize an additional goodwill impairment charge immediately after the segment change as the reassigned carrying values of the reporting units may exceed their respective estimated fair values. We are currently evaluating the impact and are unable to reasonably estimate the additional goodwill impairment charge upon the segment change. At March 31, 2018, the total remaining goodwill balance for these two reporting units was $1,851 million. A further decrease in the estimated future cash flows, an increase in the discount rate and/or a decrease in the terminal growth rate, could also result in an additional goodwill impairment charge for these reporting units. 51Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Currently, all of our intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 38 years. We review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. During 2018, we performed an impairment test of intangible and other long-lived assets, and recognized non-cash asset impairment charges of $479 million pre-tax ($443 million after-tax) for McKesson Europe and Rexall Health businesses to impair the carrying value of certain intangible and other long-lived assets. We utilized an income approach (DCF method) or a combination of an income approach and a market approach for estimating the fair value of intangible assets. The fair value of the intangible assets is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company specific information. There were no material impairments of intangibles and other long-lived assets in 2017 or 2016 within our continuing operations. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Refer to Financial Note 4, “Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, supplier reserves were $227 million and $201 million. The final outcome of any outstanding claims may differ from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2018 and 2017 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2018 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $32 million in 2018. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive new tax legislation referred to as the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. Although our accounting for the impact of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete, we have made estimates based on management judgment and recorded provisional amounts. Refer to Financial Note 10, “Income Taxes,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. 52Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time to time. Net cash flow provided from operating activities was $4,345 million in 2018 compared to $4,744 million in 2017 and $3,672 million in 2016. Operating activities for 2018 were primarily affected by a decrease in receivables primarily due to timing of receipts and loss of customers and increases in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases. Operating activities for 2017 and 2016 were primarily affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements and vendor payment terms. Operating activities for 2017 and 2016 included cash generated from our Core MTS business. Operating activities for 2017 were also affected by $150 million of settlement payment.

The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. The Board authorized the repurchase of the Company’s common stock up to $4 billion in October 2016. In 2016, we repurchased 8.7 million of our shares through a combination of an ASR program and open market transactions. In 2017, we repurchased 14.1 million of our shares through open market transactions and 1.4 million of our shares through an ASR program. We received 0.3 million additional shares in April 2017 for the 2017 ASR program. In 2018, we repurchased 3.5 million of our shares through open market transactions and 6.7 million of our shares through ASR programs. We received an additional 0.5 million shares in April 2018 under the March 2018 ASR program.

In May 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The total authorization outstanding for repurchases of the Company’s common stock was increased to $5.1 billion.We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.54Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions, except ratios)2018 2017 2016Cash and cash equivalents$2,672 $2,783 $4,048 Working capital451 1,336 3,366 Debt to capital ratio (1)40.6% 39.2% 43.6%Return on McKesson stockholders’ equity (2)0.6 54.6 26.0 (1)Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).(2)Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable and a decrease in receivables, partially offset by an increase in inventories. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance and an increase in drafts and accounts payable and deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by increases in receivables. Our debt to capital ratio increased for 2018 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ equity and decreased for 2017 primarily due to an increase in stockholders’ equity. In July 2017, the Company’s quarterly dividend was raised from $0.28 to $0.34 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. Dividends were $1.30 per share in 2018, $1.12 per share in 2017 and $1.08 per share in 2016. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid total cash dividends of $262 million, $253 million and $244 million. Additionally, as required under the Domination Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe.55Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Contractual Obligations:The table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2018: Years(In millions)Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5On balance sheet Long-term debt (1)$7,880 $1,129 $690 $1,037 $5,024Other (2) (3)666 230 229 62 145 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (4)2,090 223 396 355 1,116Purchase obligations (5)4,369 4,356 9 4 —Operating lease obligations (6) 3,072 502 826 610 1,134Other (7)338 178 25 28 107Total$18,415 $6,618 $2,175 $2,096 $7,526(1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations.

Actual lump sum payments could significantly differ from the estimated amounts depending on the timing of executive retirements and the lump sum interest rate in effect upon retirement. The estimated benefit payments do not reflect the potential effect of the termination of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on May 23, 2018.

The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.At March 31, 2018, we had a $90 million noncurrent liability payable to Change Healthcare shareholders associated with a tax receivable agreement entered into in connection with Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. The amount is based on certain estimates and could become payable in periods after a disposition of our investment in Change Healthcare.Our banks and insurance companies have issued $259 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at March 31, 2018. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.The carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to McKesson Europe was $1.46 billion at March 31, 2018, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.35 billion. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement on December 2, 2014, the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe received a put right that enables them to put their McKesson Europe shares to McKesson at €22.99 per share, which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published semiannually by the German Bundesbank, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid (“Put Amount”). The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the Put Amount are uncertain. 56Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (the “Compensation Amount”) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the Domination Agreement, which became effective in December 2014. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. The Domination Agreement does not have an expiration date and can be terminated by McKesson without cause in writing no earlier than March 31, 2020. Refer to Financial Note 11, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 16, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 26, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion and in cash and cash equivalents. The effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2018 and 2017 of approximately $10 million and $19 million.Foreign exchange risk: We conduct our business worldwide in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in U.S. dollars. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. We have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. The forward contracts and cross-currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk.As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $458 million and $357 million. However, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Refer to Financial Note 20, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps.The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.58Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:40.753541

The increase in revenue for 2018 was also offset by the 2017 contribution of the majority of our McKesson Technology Solutions businesses (“Core MTS Business”) to form the Change Healthcare joint venture. Market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion. Gross Profit:Gross profit and gross profit margin increased in 2019 compared to 2018. Gross profit increased due to market growth, partially offset by loss of customers. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin for 2019 was also due to the receipt of net cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements of $202 million, higher last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) credits and our business acquisitions. These increases in 2019 were partially offset by the incremental government reimbursement reductions in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), government imposed generic price cuts in Canada and the 2018 third quarter sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions (“EIS”) business.Gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the 2017 contribution of the Core MTS Business to the Change Healthcare joint venture, significant government reimbursement reductions in the U.K., the competitive sell-side environment and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends. These decreases in 2018 were partially offset by market growth, procurement benefits realized through the joint sourcing entity, ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP (“ClarusONE”), higher LIFO credits and our business acquisitions.Gross profit for 2019, 2018 and 2017 included LIFO credits of $210 million, $99 million and $7 million. Gross profit for 2017 benefited from $144 million of cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. Operating Expenses:Operating expenses, and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2019 and 2018. Operating expenses for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were affected by the following significant items:2019•Non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $1,776 million ($1,756 million after-tax) in our Consumer Solutions (“CS”) and Pharmacy Solutions (“PS”) reporting units within the European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Of these impairment charges, $238 million was recognized upon the 2019 first quarter segment changes, which resulted in two new reporting units. The remaining charges were primarily due to declines in the reporting units’ estimated future cash flows and the selection of higher discount rates. These impairment charges were generally not deductible for income tax purposes. The declines in estimated future cash flows were primarily attributed to additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures within the U.K. The risk of successfully achieving certain business initiatives was the primary factor in the use of a higher discount rate. At March 31, 2019, both CS and PS reporting units had no remaining goodwill balances;•Pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of $331 million ($273 million after-tax), primarily representing employee severance and exit-related costs related to the 2019 restructuring initiatives, as further discussed below;•Non-cash pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges of $245 million ($207 million after-tax) primarily for our U.K. business (mainly pharmacy licenses) driven by additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures in the U.K.;33Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)•Higher opioid-related costs of $151 million ($122 million after-tax) primarily related to litigation expenses. The Company is a defendant in many cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances to pharmacies, often together with other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacy chains named as defendants. In addition, the State of New York has recently adopted a tax on sales of opioids in the State, and other states are considering legislation that could require us to pay taxes, licensing fees, or assessments on the distribution of opioid medications in those states. Liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws will likely have an adverse impact on our results of operations, unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted. Refer to Financial Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information;•Gain from an escrow settlement of $97 million (pre-tax and after-tax) representing certain indemnity and other claims related to our 2017 acquisition of Rexall Health;•Pre-tax credit of $90 million ($66 million after-tax) related to the derecognition of a tax receivable agreement (“TRA”) payable to the shareholders of Change Healthcare Inc. (“Change”); and •Higher operating expenses due to our business acquisitions and to support growth2018•Non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $1,283 million (pre-tax and after-tax) for the European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and $455 million (pre-tax and after-tax) for our Rexall Health reporting unit in Other. There were no tax benefits associated with these goodwill impairment charges. The impairments for Europe were triggered primarily by government reimbursement reductions in our retail business in the U.K. and a more competitive environment in France. The impairments for Rexall Health were primarily driven by significant generics reimbursement reductions across Canada and minimum wage increases in multiple provinces. At March 31, 2018, the Rexall Health reporting unit had no remaining goodwill related to our acquisition of Rexall Health;•Non-cash pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges of $446 million ($410 million after-tax) primarily due to the declines in estimated future cash flows in our European business including those declines in our U.K. retail business driven by government reimbursement reductions;•Pre-tax restructuring charges of $74 million ($67 million after-tax) primarily representing employee severance and lease exit costs related to the 2018 restructuring plan for our McKesson Europe business. Under this plan, we expect to record total pre-tax charges of approximately $90 million to $130 million, of which $92 million of pre-tax charges were recorded to date;•Higher expenses due to our business acquisitions; •Pre-tax charitable contribution expense of $100 million ($64 million after-tax) to a public benefit California foundation; and•Pre-tax gain of $109 million ($30 million after-tax) recognized from the sale of our EIS business within Other2017•Pre-tax gain of $3,947 million ($3,018 million after-tax) related to the 2017 contribution of the Core MTS Business to the Change Healthcare joint venture; and•Non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million ($282 million after-tax) related to our EIS business within Other. This impairment charge was generally not deductible for income tax purposes.34Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Goodwill Impairments:As a result of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of our reporting units excluding the CS and PS reporting units exceeded their carrying value. However, other risks, expenses and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise the projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our McKesson Canada reporting unit in Other in future periods. Fiscal 2019 Restructuring InitiativesOn April 25, 2018, the Company announced a strategic growth initiative intended to drive long-term incremental profit growth and increase operational efficiency. The initiative consists of multiple growth priorities and plans to optimize the Company’s operating models and cost structures primarily through the centralization and outsourcing of certain administrative functions and cost management. As part of the growth initiative, we committed to implement certain actions including a reduction in workforce, facility consolidation and store closures. We expect to record total pre-tax charges of approximately $140 million to $180 million, of which we recorded pre-tax charges of $135 million ($122 million after-tax) in 2019. This set of the initiatives will be substantially completed by the end of 2020. Estimated remaining charges primarily consist of exit-related costs including contract termination costs.As previously announced on November 30, 2018, the Company relocated its corporate headquarters from San Francisco, California to Irving, Texas to improve efficiency, collaboration and cost competitiveness, effective April 1, 2019. We anticipate that the relocation will be completed by January 2021. We expect to record total pre-tax charges of approximately $80 million to $130 million, of which pre-tax charges of $33 million ($24 million after-tax) were recorded in 2019 primarily representing employee severance. Estimated remaining charges primarily consist of lease and other exit-related costs, employee retention and relocation expenses.During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company committed to additional programs to continue our operating model and cost optimization efforts. We continue to implement centralization of certain functions and outsourcing through the expanded arrangement with a third-party vendor to achieve operational efficiency. The programs also include reorganization and consolidation of our business operations and related headcount reductions as well as the further closures of retail pharmacy stores in Europe and facilities. We expect to incur total pre-tax charges of approximately $300 million to $350 million for these programs, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2021. In 2019, pre-tax charges of $163 million ($127 million after-tax) were recorded, which primarily represent employee severance and accelerated depreciation expense. Estimated remaining charges primarily consist of facility and other exit costs and employee-related costs.Refer to Financial Note 3, “Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.Other Income, Net: Other income, net, for 2019 and 2018 increased compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to higher gains recognized from the sales of investments.Loss from Equity Method Investment in Change Healthcare: 2019 and 2018 include our proportionate share of the loss from the Change Healthcare joint venture of $194 million and $248 million, which includes amortization expenses associated with equity method intangible assets and integration expenses incurred by the joint venture. 2018 also includes certain transaction expenses, partially offset by a tax benefit of $76 million primarily due to a reduction in the future applicable tax rate related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). Refer to Financial Note 5, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.Acquisition-Related Expenses and AdjustmentsAcquisition-related expenses, which included transaction and integration expenses directly related to business acquisitions and the gain on the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange were $228 million and $168 million in 2019 and 2018, and net credit of $3,797 million in 2017. 2019 and 2018 include our proportionate share of transaction and integration expenses incurred by Change Healthcare. 2018 includes a pre-tax gain of $37 million associated with the final net working capital and other adjustments from the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. 2017 includes a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million from the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. 35Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Acquisition-related expenses and adjustments were recorded as follows: Years Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions)2019 2018 2017Operating Expenses Gain on Change Healthcare Net Asset Exchange, net $— $(37) $(3,947)Transaction closing expenses3 15 30Restructuring, severance and relocation12 36 25Other (1)103 54 85Total118 68 (3,807)Other Expenses (2)110 100 10Total Acquisition-Related Expenses and Adjustments$228 $168 $(3,797)(1)These expenses primarily include outside service fees, costs associated with information technology and other integration activities.(2)Fiscal 2019 and 2018 includes our proportionate share of transaction and integration expenses incurred by Change Healthcare, excluding certain fair value adjustments, which were recorded within “Loss from Equity Method Investment in Change Healthcare”. Amortization Expenses of Acquired Intangible AssetsAmortization expenses of acquired intangible assets directly related to business acquisitions and the formation of the Change Healthcare joint venture were $790 million, $792 million and $440 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017. These expenses were primarily recorded in our operating expenses and for 2019 and 2018 also in our proportionate share of loss from the equity method investment in Change Healthcare.Income Taxes We recorded income tax expense of $356 million, benefit of $53 million and expense of $1,614 million related to continuing operations in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Our reported income tax expense rate for 2019 was 58.4% compared to an income tax benefit rate of 22.2% for 2018 and an income tax expense rate of 23.4% in 2017. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, the impact of nondeductible impairment charges, and varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have income tax rates different from the U.S. rate.Our reported income tax expense rate for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by non-cash pre-tax charges of $1,776 million ($1,756 million after-tax) to impair the carrying value of goodwill for our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes. As a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, the 2018 income tax benefit rate included a tax benefit of $1,324 million from the re-measurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower U.S. federal tax rate, partially offset by a tax expense of $457 million representing the one-time tax imposed on certain accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries. The reported income tax benefit and expense rates for 2018 and 2017 were also unfavorably affected by the non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $1,738 million (pre-tax and after-tax) and $290 million ($282 million after-tax), given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Goodwill Impairment Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information.Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., Canada and the U.K., we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.On July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share expenses related to share-based compensation. This opinion reversed the prior decision of the United States Tax Court. On August 7, 2018, the opinion was withdrawn and a rehearing of the case took place on October 16, 2018. We will continue to monitor developments in this case and the ultimate outcome may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate. 36Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax: Income (Loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, were income of $1 million and $5 million in 2019 and 2018, and loss of $124 million in 2017. Loss from discontinued operations, net for 2017 includes an after-tax loss of $113 million related to the sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business within our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. We made a payment of approximately $100 million related to this sale in 2017. Refer to Financial Note 7, “Discontinued Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the annual recurring compensation that we are obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”). Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes third-party equity interests in our consolidated entities including ClarusONE and Vantage. Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within the Company’s control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of Stockholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheet.

In addition, revenues in Other for 2019 were negatively impacted by the 2018 sale of our EIS business. These decreases for 2019 are partially offset by growth in our Canadian and McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions (“MRxTS”) businesses and the effects of acquisitions in Canada.

Corporate expenses, net, increased for 2018 primarily due to a charitable contribution expense of $100 million and higher professional fees incurred for Corporate initiatives.Loss on Debt Extinguishment: In 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of $122 million ($78 million after-tax) primarily representing premiums related to our February 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing outstanding long-term debt.Interest Expense: Interest expense decreased over the last two years primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in the issuance of commercial paper. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.Foreign OperationsOur foreign operations represented approximately 18%, 18% and 17% of our consolidated revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency effect”, which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In computing foreign currency effect, we translate our current year results in local currencies into U.S dollars by applying average foreign exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods in U.S. dollars. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in Financial Note 28, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Business CombinationsRefer to Financial Note 4, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Fiscal 2020 OutlookInformation regarding the Company’s fiscal 2020 outlook is contained in our Forms 8-K and 8-K/A dated May 8, 2019. These Forms should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.40Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes general and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2019, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) accounted for approximately 49.9% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 19.4% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2019, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 31.9% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS were approximately 18.4% of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2019 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future.At March 31, 2019, trade and notes receivables were $15,329 million prior to allowances of $273 million. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, our provision for bad debts was $132 million, $44 million and $93 million. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.8% and 1.3%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2019 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $15 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst-case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Inventories: Inventories consist of merchandise held for resale. Prior to 2018, we reported inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Effective in the first quarter of 2018, we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on first-in, first-out method and weighted average purchase prices. Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories, net were $16,709 million and $16,310 million at March 31, 2019 and 2018. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 62% and 63% of our inventories at March 31, 2019 and 2018. If we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately $696 million and $906 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2019 and 2018. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. We recognized LIFO credits of $210 million, $99 million and $7 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017 within our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. 41Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We believe that moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. In determining whether inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use a method based on the income approach. Methods under the income approach start with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in methods based on the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 4, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9,358 million and $10,924 million of goodwill at March 31, 2019 and 2018, $3,689 million and $4,102 million of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2019 and 2018. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.In 2018, we elected to early adopt on a prospective basis, the amended guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the second step of the impairment test. The one-step impairment test under the amended guidance requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, if any. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.42Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rates or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. For example, some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the DCF method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Under the income approach, the fair value estimates in the goodwill impairment analysis are highly sensitive to the discount rates used in the discounting of expected cash flows attributable to the reporting units. The discount rates are the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital. The unsystematic risk premium is an input factor used in calculating discount rate that specifically addresses uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections. Increases in the unsystematic risk premium increase the discount rate. As a result of the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of our reporting units excluding the CS and PS reporting units exceeded their carrying value. However, other risks, expenses and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise the projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods. For example, the estimated fair value of our McKesson Canada reporting unit within Other exceeded the carrying value of this reporting unit by 8% in 2019. The goodwill balance of this reporting unit was $1,444 million at March 31, 2019 or approximately 15% of the consolidated goodwill balance. Generally, a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of 12% or an increase in the discount rate in excess of 1.0% could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit in future reporting periods. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Goodwill Impairment Charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Currently, all of our intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 38 years. We review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Restructuring Charges: We have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exit-related costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. We generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred. In connection with these restructuring actions, we also assess the recoverability of long-lived assets used in the business, and as a result, we may recognize accelerated depreciation reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets.43Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in facts and circumstances. The final outcome of any outstanding claims may differ from our estimate. The supplier reserves primarily pertain to our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive new tax legislation referred to as the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. Refer to Financial Note 10, “Income Taxes,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. 44Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time to time. Net cash flow provided from operating activities was $4,036 million in 2019 compared to $4,345 million in 2018 and $4,744 million in 2017. Operating activities for 2019 were primarily affected by an increase in receivables due to overall increase in sales volume and timing of receipts and increases in drafts and accounts payable primarily due to increased inventory purchases and timing of payments. Operating activities for 2018 were primarily affected by a decrease in receivables primarily due to timing of receipts and loss of customers and increases in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases. Operating activities for 2017 were primarily affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements and vendor payment terms. Operating activities for 2017 included cash generated from our Core MTS business. Operating activities for 2017 were also affected by $150 million of a settlement payment. Net cash used in investing activities was $1,381 million in 2019 compared to $2,993 million in 2018 and $3,269 million in 2017. Investing activities for 2019 include $905 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $784 million for our acquisition of MSD, $426 million and $131 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $101 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. Investing activities for 2018 include $2,893 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $1.3 billion and $720 million for our acquisitions of CoverMyMeds, LLC and RxCrossroads, $405 million and $175 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, $374 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and investments and $126 million cash payment received related to the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. Investing activities for 2017 included $4,212 million of net cash payments for acquisitions including $2.1 billion for our acquisition of Rexall Health, $1,226 million of net payments received on the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, $404 million and $158 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $206 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. Financing activities utilized $2,227 million, $3,084 million and $2,069 million of cash in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Financing activities for 2019 include cash receipts of $37,265 million and payments of $37,268 million from short-term borrowings (primarily commercial paper). We received cash from long-term debt issuances of $1,099 million and made repayments on long-term debt of $1,112 million in 2019. Financing activities in 2019 also include $1,627 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $292 million of dividends paid. Financing activities for 2018 include cash receipts of $20,542 million and payments of $20,725 million from short-term borrowings (primarily commercial paper). We received cash from long-term debt issuances of $1,522 million and made repayments on long-term debt of $2,287 million in 2018. Financing activities in 2018 also include $1,650 million of cash paid for stock repurchases $262 million of dividends paid and $112 million of payments for debt extinguishment. Financing activities for 2017 include cash receipts of $8,294 million and payments of $8,124 million from short-term borrowings. We received cash from long-term debt issuances of $1,824 million and made repayments on long-term debt of $1,601 million in 2017. Financing activities in 2017 also include $2,250 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $253 million of dividends paid. The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. 45Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)In 2017, we repurchased 14.1 million of our shares through open market transactions and 1.4 million of our shares through an ASR program. We received 0.3 million additional shares in April 2017 for the 2017 ASR program. In 2018, we repurchased 3.5 million of our shares through open market transactions and 6.7 million of our shares through ASR programs. We received an additional 1.0 million shares in the first quarter of 2019 under the March 2018 ASR program. In 2019, we repurchased 10.4 million of our shares through open market transactions and 2.1 million of our shares through the December 2018 ASR program.In 2019, we retired 5.0 million or $542 million of the Company’s treasury shares previously repurchased. Under the applicable state law, these shares resume the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. In accordance with our accounting policy, we allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. Accordingly, our retained earnings and additional paid-in capital were reduced by $472 million and $70 million during 2019. Years Ended March 31,(In millions, except per share data)2019 2018 2017Number of shares repurchased (1)13.5 10.5 15.5Average price paid per share$130.72 $151.06 $141.16Total value of shares repurchased (1)$1,627 $1,650 $2,250(1)Excludes shares surrendered for tax withholding.The total authorization outstanding for repurchase of the Company’s common stock was $3.5 billion at March 31, 2019. We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions, except ratios)2019 2018 2017Cash and cash equivalents$2,981 $2,672 $2,783 Working capital839 451 1,336 Debt to capital ratio (1)43.3% 40.6% 39.2%Return on McKesson stockholders’ equity (2)0.4 0.6 54.6 (1)Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).(2)Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2019 included approximately $1,450 million of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. Following enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, the repatriation of cash to the United States is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes.46Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and other current liabilities. We require a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2019 compared to March 31, 2018 primarily due to an increase in the cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories and a decrease in current portion of long-term debt, partially offset by a increase in drafts and accounts payable. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable and a decrease in receivables, partially offset by an increase in inventories. Our debt to capital ratio increased for 2019 and 2018 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ equity.In July 2018, the Company’s quarterly dividend was raised from $0.34 to $0.39 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. Dividends were $1.51 per share in 2019, $1.30 per share in 2018 and $1.12 per share in 2017. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we paid total cash dividends of $292 million, $262 million and $253 million. Additionally, as required under the Domination Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe.Contractual Obligations:The table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2019: Years(In millions)Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5On balance sheet Long-term debt (1)$7,595 $330 $1,737 $1,900 $3,628Other (2) 648 223 91 89 245 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3)2,018 234 413 348 1,023Purchase obligations (4)4,631 4,544 35 52 —Operating lease obligations (5) 2,656 454 740 526 936Other (6)366 195 31 50 90Total$17,914 $5,980 $3,047 $2,965 $5,922(1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations. (2)Includes our estimated benefit payments, including assumed executive lump sum payments, for the unfunded benefit plans and minimum funding requirements for the pension plans. Actual lump sum payments could significantly differ from the estimated amounts depending on the timing of executive retirements and the lump sum interest rate in effect upon retirement. The estimated benefit payments do not reflect the potential effect of the termination of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on May 23, 2018. (3)Primarily represents interest that will become due on our fixed rate long-term debt obligations.(4)A purchase obligation is defined as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases and capital commitments. (5)Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases.(6)Includes agreements under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory and our customers’ debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions.The contractual obligations table above excludes the following obligations:At March 31, 2019, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $810 million. The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.47Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)During 2019, we renegotiated the terms of the TRA which resulted in the extinguishment and derecognition of the $90 million noncurrent liability. In exchange for the shareholders of Change agreeing to extinguish the liability, we agreed to an allocation of certain tax amortization that had the effect of reducing the amount of a distribution from the Change Healthcare joint venture that would otherwise have been required to be made to the shareholders of Change. As a result of the renegotiation, McKesson was relieved from any potential future obligations associated with the noncurrent liability and recognized a pre-tax credit of $90 million ($66 million after-tax) in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations in 2019. Our banks and insurance companies have issued $165 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at March 31, 2019. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.The carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to McKesson Europe was $1.39 billion at March 31, 2019, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.23 billion. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement on December 2, 2014, the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe received a put right that enables them to put their McKesson Europe shares to McKesson at €22.99 per share, which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published semiannually by the German Bundesbank, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid (“Put Amount”). The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the Put Amount are uncertain. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (the “Compensation Amount”) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the Domination Agreement. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. The Domination Agreement does not have an expiration date and can be terminated by McKesson without cause in writing no earlier than March 31, 2020. Refer to Financial Note 11, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 16, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 26, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.48Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded) Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion and in cash and cash equivalents. The effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2019 and 2018 of approximately $4 million and $10 million.Foreign exchange risk: We conduct our business worldwide in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in U.S. dollars. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies. We have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. The forward contracts and cross-currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk.As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $581 million and $458 million. However, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Refer to Financial Note 20, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps.The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.49Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:41.020324

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean our fiscal year.Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Overview of Our Business:We are a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare technology. We partner with life sciences companies, manufacturers, providers, pharmacies, governments and other healthcare organizations to help provide the right medicines, medical products and healthcare services to the right patients at the right time, safely and cost-effectively. We conduct our business through three reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All remaining operating segments and business activities that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure are included in Other, which primarily consists of McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions (“MRxTS”) and our investment in Change Healthcare LLC (“Change Healthcare JV”), which was split-off from the Company in the fourth quarter of 2020 as further discussed in this Financial Review. Our organizational structure also includes Corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects, and the results of certain investments. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of the individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit before interest expense and income taxes. Refer to Financial Note 24, “Segments of Business,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of these segments. 25Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Executive Summary:The following executive summary provides highlights and key factors that impacted our business, operating results and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2020. The coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) did not significantly impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in 2020. For a more in-depth discussion of how COVID-19 impacted our business, operations, and outlook, see the COVID-19 section of ""Trends and Uncertainties"" included below.•Revenues of $231.1 billion, reflecting an 8% increase from the prior year driven primarily by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, including branded pharmaceutical price increases and higher volumes from retail national account customers;•Gross profit increased 2% from the prior year primarily driven by market growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment;•On October 21, 2019, we disclosed an opioid-related litigation settlement with two Ohio counties and recorded a related charge of $82 million in total operating expenses;•On December 12, 2019, McKesson and Walgreens Boots Alliance announced an agreement to create a joint venture that is expected to combine their respective pharmaceutical wholesale businesses in Germany. As a result of this agreement, we recognized fair value remeasurement charges of $275 million in total operating expenses within our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment;•On March 10, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our investment in Change Healthcare JV and recognized an estimated gain of $414 million related to this transaction. We no longer hold an interest in any securities of Change Healthcare JV or Change Healthcare, Inc. (“Change”) following the separation. During the second quarter of 2020, we recorded an other-than-temporary-impairment (“OTTI”) charge of $1.2 billion and a dilution loss of $246 million related to our investment in Change Healthcare JV;•Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation in 2020 of $4.99 reflects the aforementioned items and a lower share count compared to the prior year driven largely by share repurchases; and•We returned $2.2 billion of cash to shareholders through $1.9 billion of common stock repurchases and $294 million of dividend payments. Trends and Uncertainties:COVID-19In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” on January 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.We continue to evaluate the nature and extent COVID-19 may have to our business and operations. The pandemic is developing rapidly and the full extent to which COVID-19 will impact us depends on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, as well as potential seasonality of new outbreaks.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local government directives and policies have been put in place in the United States to enhance availability of medications and supplies to meet the increased demand, assist front-line healthcare providers, manage public health concerns by creating social distancing, and address the economic impacts, including sharply reduced business activity, increased unemployment, and overall uncertainty presented by this new healthcare challenge. Similar governmental actions have occurred in Canada and Europe. As a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information technology, we are uniquely positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Canada, and Europe. We are working closely with national and local governments, agencies, and industry partners to ensure supplies, including personal protective equipment, and medicine reach our customers and patients when they need them. 26Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that we continue to supply our customers and protect the safety of our employees. The various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations, including telecommuting and work-from-home policies, restricted travel requirements, employee support programs, and enhanced safety measures are intended to limit exposure to COVID-19. These successful steps in our fourth quarter of 2020 have resulted in limited disruption of our normal business operations, productivity trends, and slightly compressed operating margins due to increased operating expenses.The financial impact to the year ended March 31, 2020 is muted due to the timing of the COVID-19 pandemic late in our fourth quarter. We experienced higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in March, however, these increases were partially offset by decreases in specialty drug volumes and decreased demand within primary care medical-surgical supplies. Specialty drug volumes were negatively impacted by lower demand for infusions, elective specialty drugs, oncology, and dermatology practice sales. Demand for primary care medical-surgical supplies were negatively impacted by deferrals in elective procedures in hospitals and surgery centers as well as decreased traffic or closures in doctor’s offices. These positive and negative COVID-19 impacts drove increased consolidated revenues by less than 1% in 2020.The increased volumes and revenue due to COVID-19 favorably impacted income from continuing operations before income taxes, but were mostly offset by increased variable labor costs, enhanced sterilization procedures to sanitize operating facilities, costs of personal protection equipment for our employees, and increased costs of transport as well as increased other operating expenses. Additionally, as previously mentioned, decreased specialty drug volumes and demand challenges for primary care medical-surgical supplies weighed negatively on income from continuing operations before income taxes. We also expanded temporary employee benefits and incentives targeted for our front-line employees to not only protect their safety, but to provide further support including additional medical benefits, emergency leave as well as added compensation. The overall impact to income from continuing operations before income taxes from the favorable and unfavorable items mentioned above largely offset each other, however, impacts to future periods due to COVID-19 may differ based on future developments, including the duration and spread of the virus as well as potential seasonality of new outbreaks. Overall operating margins were compressed due to higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes, shifts in product mix, higher demand by retail national accounts and increased operating expenses. Our consolidated balance sheets and ability to maintain financial liquidity remains strong. We have experienced no material impacts to our liquidity or net working capital. With many of our customers anticipating extended declines in their businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are monitoring closely for trends that may impact their timing or ability to pay amounts owed to us. We remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility. Long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, have remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are signs of stress in both markets, we do not have an immediate need to access these markets and could use our revolving credit facility to meet any near-term liquidity needs. We have seen some improvement in conditions in the debt markets and commercial paper markets as the Federal Reserve has taken steps to stabilize the markets. We believe we have the ability to meet the covenants of our credit agreements.We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic impact on our supply chain. We were able to maintain appropriate labor and overall vendor supply levels under the circumstances in the fourth quarter, despite challenges including higher sickness rates and service level issues with suppliers. Supplier shortages and stock-outs for certain products have occurred in specific instances as demand in excess of supply escalated for certain items tied to the COVID-19 pandemic response, such as personal protective equipment and other preventive products. Our inventory levels have fluctuated in response to these supply dynamics and increased concentrated customer orders for certain products, with varying inventory level impacts depending on the specific product within our portfolio of offerings. Although the availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers, their location and the extent to which they are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proactively working with manufacturers, industry partners, and government agencies to meet the needs of our customers during the pandemic. We have assembled a Critical Care Drug Task Force, made up of our procurement specialists, clinical health systems pharmacists, and supply chain professionals, focused on securing additional product where available, sourcing back-up products, adjusting allocations to ensure equitable distribution and to protect our operations across all locations and facilities. We have a robust Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Program (“BCRP”) and we have proactively enhanced our BCRP in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 27Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business operations and financial results beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020. Although the financial impact on our overall 2020 results is limited due to the timing of the outbreak, we face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects on our future business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Additionally, responses from authorities and regulators at all levels of government may materially impact us in future periods. Due to several rapidly changing variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate future economic trends and the timing of when stability will return. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a disclosure of risk factors related to COVID-19.Opioid-Related Litigation and Claims We are a defendant in over 3,000 legal proceedings asserting claims related to distribution of controlled substances (opioids) in federal and state courts throughout the United States, and in Puerto Rico and Canada. We are vigorously defending ourselves against such claims and proceedings and are a party to discussions with the objective of achieving broad resolution of the remaining claims. Because of the large number of parties involved, together with the novelty and complexity of the issues, for which there may be different considerations among the parties, we cannot predict the successful resolution through a negotiated settlement. An adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations.

Market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion. The increase in revenues for 2019 was also due to our 2019 first quarter acquisition of Medical Specialties Distributors LLC (“MSD”), partially offset by loss of customers within our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. The impact from COVID-19 increased revenues by less than 1% for the year ended March 31, 2020 and was primarily attributable to our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions and European Pharmaceutical Solutions segments.Gross Profit Gross profit increased for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Gross profit and gross profit margin for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year were unfavorably impacted by a decrease in net cash proceeds received of $22 million in 2020 compared to $202 million in 2019 representing our share of antitrust legal settlements, partially offset by higher last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) credits in 2020 due to higher generic deflation. The impact from COVID-19 increased gross profit by less than 1% and decreased gross profit margin by less than 10 basis points for the year ended March 31, 2020.Gross profit and gross profit margin increased for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. Gross profit increased due to market growth, partially offset by loss of customers. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin for 2019 was also due to the receipt of net cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements of $202 million, higher LIFO credits and our business acquisitions. These increases in 2019 were partially offset by the incremental government reimbursement reductions in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), government imposed generic price cuts in Canada and the 2018 third quarter sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions (“EIS”) business.Gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included LIFO inventory credits of $252 million, $210 million and $99 million. Refer to the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section included in this Financial Review for further information.Total Operating Expenses A summary of the components of our total operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions, except ratios)2020 2019 2018 20202019Selling, distribution and administrative expenses$9,168 $8,403 $8,138 9%3%Research and development96 71 125 35 (43) Goodwill impairment charges2 1,797 1,738 (100) 3 Restructuring, impairment and related charges268 597 567 (55) 5 Gain from sale of business— — (109) NM (100) Gain on healthcare technology net asset exchange, net— — (37) NM (100) Total Operating Expenses$9,534 $10,868 $10,422 (12)%4%Percent of Revenues4.13%5.07%5.00%(94)bp7bpTotal operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year and increased for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. 29Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Total operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were affected by the following significant items:2020•Selling, distribution and administrative expenses (“SD&A”) includes charges of $275 million to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell related to the expected contribution of the majority of our German wholesale business to create a joint venture in which McKesson will have a non-controlling interest within our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Held for Sale,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information; •SD&A includes opioid-related expenses of $232 million, primarily litigation and related expenses, including the second quarter settlement charge of $82 million recorded in connection with an agreement executed in December 2019 to settle all opioid-related claims filed by two Ohio counties;•Restructuring, impairment and related charges includes long-lived asset impairment charges of $112 million, primarily for our U.K. business (mainly pharmacy licenses) and Rexall Health retail business (“Rexall Health”) in Other (mainly customer relationships), and the remaining $156 million primarily represents employee severance and exit-related costs related to our 2019 restructuring initiatives, as further discussed below; and•Total operating expenses includes higher SD&A due to our business acquisitions and to support business growth, as well as our technology initiatives, partially offset by favorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations.2019•Goodwill impairment charges of $1.8 billion in our Retail Pharmacy (“RP”, formerly “Consumer Solutions”) and Pharmaceutical Distribution (“PD”, formerly “Pharmacy Solutions”) reporting units within the European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Of these impairment charges, $238 million was recognized upon the 2019 first quarter segment changes, which resulted in two new reporting units. The remaining charges primarily were due to declines in the reporting units’ estimated future cash flows and the selection of higher discount rates. These impairment charges generally were not deductible for income tax purposes. The declines in estimated future cash flows primarily were attributed to additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures within the U.K. The risk of successfully achieving certain business initiatives was the primary factor in the use of a higher discount rate. At March 31, 2019, both RP and PD reporting units had no remaining goodwill balances;•Restructuring, impairment and related charges primarily includes employee severance and exit-related costs of $331 million for our 2019 restructuring initiatives, as further discussed below and long-lived asset impairment charges of $245 million primarily for our U.K. business (mainly pharmacy licenses) driven by additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures in the U.K.; and•SD&A includes opioid-related costs of $151 million primarily related to litigation expenses and increased expenses due to our business acquisitions and to support growth, partially offset by a gain from an escrow settlement of $97 million representing certain indemnity and other claims related to our 2017 acquisition of Rexall Health and a credit of $90 million for the derecognition of a liability related to the tax receivable agreement (“TRA”) payable to the shareholders of Change. 2018•Goodwill impairment charges of $1.3 billion for the European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment and $455 million for Rexall Health. There were no tax benefits associated with these goodwill impairment charges. The impairments for Europe were triggered primarily by government reimbursement reductions in our retail business in the U.K. and a more competitive environment in France. The impairments for Rexall Health were primarily driven by significant generics reimbursement reductions across Canada and minimum wage increases in multiple provinces. At March 31, 2018, Rexall Health had no remaining goodwill related to our acquisition of Rexall Health;30Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)•Restructuring, impairment and related charges primarily includes long-lived asset impairment charges of $446 million due to the declines in estimated future cash flows in our European business including those declines in our U.K. retail business driven by government reimbursement reductions. In addition, we recorded employee severance and lease exit costs of $74 million for our 2018 restructuring plan in our McKesson Europe business. The plan was substantially completed in 2020;•SD&A includes a charitable contribution expense of $100 million to a public benefit California foundation (the “Foundation”);•SD&A includes increased expenses due to our business acquisitions, partially offset by a gain from sale of business of $109 million related to the sale of our EIS business within Other.Goodwill ImpairmentsThe impairment testing performed in 2020 did not indicate any material impairment of goodwill. As of the testing date, other risks, expenses and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods, including our McKesson Canada reporting unit in Other where the risk of a material goodwill impairment is higher than other reporting units. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in this Financial Review for further information.On October 1, 2019, we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 to better align with the timing of our annual long-term planning process. This change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge. Refer to Note 14, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.2019 Restructuring InitiativesOn April 25, 2018, we announced a strategic growth initiative intended to drive long-term incremental profit growth and increase operational efficiency. The initiative consists of multiple growth priorities and plans to optimize our operating models and cost structures primarily through the centralization, cost management and outsourcing of certain administrative functions. As part of the growth initiative, we committed to implement certain actions including a reduction in workforce, facility consolidation and store closures. This set of the initiatives was substantially complete by the end of 2020 and we recorded charges of $15 million and $135 million in 2020 and 2019 primarily representing employee severance, exit-related costs and asset impairment charges. Any remaining charges primarily consist of exit-related costs. As previously announced on November 30, 2018, we relocated our corporate headquarters from San Francisco, California to Irving, Texas to improve efficiency, collaboration and cost competitiveness, effective April 1, 2019. We anticipate that the relocation will be complete by January 2021. We expect to incur total charges of approximately $80 million to $130 million, of which charges of $44 million and $33 million were recorded in 2020 and 2019 primarily representing employee retention expenses, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation. The estimated remaining charges primarily consist of lease and other exit-related costs, and employee-related expenses including retention.During the fourth quarter of 2019, we committed to additional programs to continue our operating model and cost optimization efforts. We continue to implement centralization of certain functions and outsourcing through the expanded arrangement with a third-party vendor to achieve operational efficiency. The programs also include reorganization and consolidation of our business operations and related headcount reductions, closures of retail pharmacy stores in Europe and closures of other facilities. We anticipate these additional programs will be substantially complete by the end of 2021. We expect to incur total charges of approximately $300 million to $350 million for these programs, of which charges of $72 million and $163 million were recorded in 2020 and 2019 primarily representing employee severance, accelerated depreciation expense and project consulting fees. The estimated remaining charges primarily consist of facility and other exit costs and employee-related costs.Refer to Financial Note 4, “Restructuring, Impairment and Related Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.31Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Other Income, Net Other income, net, for the year ended March 31, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the 2020 pension settlement charges of $122 million related to our previously approved termination of the frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan and higher gains recognized from the sale of investments in 2019, partially offset by higher settlement gains in 2020 from our derivative contracts. In connection with the pension plan termination, we purchased annuity contracts from an insurer that will pay and administer the future pension benefits of the remaining participants.Other income, net for the year ended March 31, 2019 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher gains recognized from the sales of investments.Equity Earnings and Charges from Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture Our investment in Change Healthcare JV is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Excluding the impairment and transaction-related items described below, our proportionate share of loss from our investment in Change Healthcare JV for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $119 million, $194 million and $248 million, which primarily includes transaction and integration expenses incurred by the joint venture and basis differences between the joint venture and McKesson including amortization of fair value adjustments. 2018 also includes certain transaction expenses, partially offset by a tax benefit of $76 million primarily due to a reduction in the future applicable tax rate related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”). During the first quarter of 2020 and for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we owned approximately 70% of this joint venture. On June 27, 2019, common stock and certain other securities of Change began trading on the NASDAQ (“IPO”). On July 1, 2019, upon the completion of its IPO, Change contributed net cash proceeds it received from its offering of common stock to Change Healthcare JV in exchange for additional membership interests of Change Healthcare JV (“LLC Units”) at the equivalent of its offering price of $13 per share. The proceeds from the concurrent offering of other securities were also used by Change to acquire certain securities of Change Healthcare JV. As a result, McKesson’s equity interest in Change Healthcare JV was reduced to approximately 58.5%, which was used to recognize our proportionate share in net loss from Change Healthcare JV, commencing the second quarter of 2020. As a result of the ownership dilution to 58.5% from 70%, we recognized a dilution loss of approximately $246 million in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, our proportionate share of income or loss from this investment was subsequently reduced as immaterial settlements of stock option exercises occurred after the IPO and further diluted our ownership.In the second quarter of 2020, we recorded an OTTI charge of $1.2 billion to our investment in Change Healthcare JV, representing the difference between the carrying value of our investment and the fair value derived from the corresponding closing price of Change’s common stock at September 30, 2019. This charge was included within equity earnings and charges from investment in Change Healthcare joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended March 31, 2020. On March 10, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our interest in Change Healthcare JV. The separation was effected through the split-off of SpinCo, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that held all of our interest in Change Healthcare JV, to certain of our stockholders through an exchange offer (“Split-off”), followed by the merger of SpinCo with and into Change, with Change surviving the merger (“Merger”). In connection with the exchange offer, on March 9, 2020, we distributed all 176.0 million outstanding shares of common stock of SpinCo to participating holders of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 15.4 million shares of McKesson common stock. Following consummation of the exchange offer, on March 10, 2020, the Merger was consummated, with each share of SpinCo common stock converted into one share of Change common stock, par value $0.001 per share, with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of Change common stock. The Split-off and Merger are intended to be generally tax-free transactions to McKesson and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Following the Split-off, we do not beneficially own any of Change’s outstanding securities. In connection with this transaction, we recognized an estimated gain for financial reporting purposes of $414 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, which was largely driven by the reversal of a related deferred tax liability. 32Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)After the separation, Change Healthcare JV is required under the TRA to pay McKesson 85% of the net cash tax savings realized, or deemed to be realized, resulting from depreciation or amortization allocated to Change by McKesson. The receipt of any payments under the TRA is dependent upon Change benefiting from this depreciation or amortization in future tax return filings, which creates uncertainty over the amount, timing and probability of the gain recognized. As such, we account for the TRA as a gain contingency, with no receivable recognized as of March 31, 2020. Loss on Debt Extinguishment In 2018, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $122 million primarily representing premiums related to our February 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing outstanding long-term debt.Interest ExpenseInterest expense decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the issuance of commercial paper, partially offset by a decrease in interest income from our derivative contracts. Interest expense decreased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in the issuance of commercial paper. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.Income Tax (Expense) Benefit We recorded income tax expense of $18 million and $356 million and tax benefit of $53 million related to continuing operations for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our reported income tax expense rates were 1.6% and 58.4% in 2020 and 2019, and our income tax benefit rate was 22.2% in 2018. Our reported income tax expense rate for 2020 was favorably impacted by an estimated gain on the Change Healthcare JV divestiture of $414 million (pre-tax and after-tax), which was intended to generally be a tax-free split-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and unfavorably impacted by charges of $275 million (pre-tax and after-tax) to remeasure the carrying value of assets and liabilities held for sale related to the expected formation of a new German wholesale joint venture within our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. Refer to Financial Note 2,“Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture” and Note 3,“Held for Sale,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for more information. Our reported income tax expense rate for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by charges of $1.8 billion (pre-tax and after-tax) to impair the carrying value of goodwill for our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment, given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes. The reported income tax benefit rate for 2018 was unfavorably impacted by the goodwill impairment charges of $1.7 billion (pre-tax and after-tax), given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes. Refer to Financial Note 14, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. As a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, the 2018 income tax benefit rate included a tax benefit of $1.3 billion from the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower U.S. federal tax rate, partially offset by a tax expense of $457 million representing the one-time tax imposed on certain accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., Canada and the U.K., we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, was a loss of $6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 and income of $1 million and $5 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. 33Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP, Vantage Oncology Holdings, LLC and the accrual of the annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe AG (“McKesson Europe”) share that McKesson is obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”). Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of Stockholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial Note 9, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $900 million, $34 million and $67 million for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation was $4.95, $0.17 and $0.32 for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, our 2020, 2019 and 2018 diluted earnings per share reflect the cumulative effects of share repurchases. Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 182 million, 197 million and 209 million for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding is impacted by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and the cumulative effect of share repurchases, including the impact of shares exchanged as part of the split-off from our investment in Change Healthcare JV, as discussed above.34Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Overview of Segment Results: Revenues: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2020 2019 2018 20202019U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions$183,341 $167,763 $162,587 9%3%European Pharmaceutical Solutions27,390 27,242 27,320 1 — Medical-Surgical Solutions8,305 7,618 6,611 9 15 Other12,015 11,696 11,839 3 (1) Total Revenues$231,051 $214,319 $208,357 8%3%U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions2020 vs. 2019U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions revenues for the year ended March 31, 2020 increased 9% compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth, including branded pharmaceutical price increases, higher volumes from retail national account customers and growth in specialty pharmaceuticals, partially offset by brand to generic drug conversions.2019 vs. 2018U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions revenues for the year ended March 31, 2019 increased 3% compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth, including expanded business with existing customers, growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and our business acquisitions, partially offset by loss of customers.

Operating profit and operating profit margin were unfavorably impacted by customer mix and lower net cash proceeds received of $22 million in 2020 compared to $202 million in 2019 representing our share of antitrust legal settlements.36Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)2019 vs. 2018Operating profit increased for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth, including growth in our specialty business, partially offset by loss of customers. Operating profit and operating profit margin for 2019 benefited from the net cash proceeds of $202 million representing our share of antitrust legal settlements and higher LIFO credits of $210 million in 2019 compared to $99 million in 2018, partially offset by a $61 million charge related to a customer bankruptcy. European Pharmaceutical Solutions2020 vs. 2019Operating loss and operating loss margin improved for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to 2019 goodwill impairment charges of $1.8 billion and decreased long-lived asset impairment charges of $82 million in 2020 compared to $210 million in 2019, partially offset by 2020 charges of $275 million for the fair value remeasurement related to our German wholesale business to be contributed to a joint venture.2019 vs. 2018Operating loss and operating loss margin were negatively impacted for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to goodwill impairment charges of $1.8 billion in 2019 compared to $1.3 billion in 2018, the effect of government reimbursement reductions and lower sales volume in the U.K., and increased competition in France. This was partially offset by market growth and long-lived asset impairment charges of $210 million in 2019 compared to $446 million in 2018.Medical-Surgical Solutions2020 vs. 2019Operating profit and operating profit margin increased for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to prior year primarily due to market growth in our primary care business and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by the remeasurement of assets and liabilities to fair value related to a divestiture that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 and higher operating expenses, including an increase in our provision for bad debts.2019 vs. 2018Operating profit decreased for the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher restructuring charges, partially offset by market growth. Operating profit margin for 2019 decreased primarily due to higher restructuring charges and changes in our mix of business, partially offset by ongoing cost management. OtherOperating profit for Other decreased for 2020 and increased in 2019 compared to the respective prior years.

Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency effect”, which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. In computing foreign currency effect, we translate our current year results in local currencies into U.S dollars by applying average foreign exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods in U.S. dollars. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in Financial Note 24, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Business CombinationsRefer to Financial Note 5, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.38Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Fiscal 2021 OutlookInformation regarding the Company’s fiscal 2021 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 20, 2020. That Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in Item 7 - Trends and Uncertainties, and the cautionary statements in Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes general and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. Sales to the Company’s ten largest customers, including GPOs, accounted for approximately 51% of total consolidated revenues in 2020 and comprised approximately 37% of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2020. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 20% of our total consolidated revenues in 2020 and comprised approximately 20% of total trade accounts receivable March 31, 2020. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. With many of our customers anticipating extended declines in their businesses due to COVID-19, we are monitoring closely for trends that may impact their timing or ability to pay amounts owed to us. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2020 are appropriate and consistent in the context of historical methodologies employed, as well as assessment of trends currently available.At March 31, 2020, trade and notes receivables were $17.6 billion prior to allowances of $252 million. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, our provision for bad debts was $91 million, $132 million and $44 million. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.4% and 1.8%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2020 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $18 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst-case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.39Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Inventories: Inventories consist of merchandise held for resale. Prior to 2018, we reported inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Effective in the first quarter of 2018, we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the last-in, last-out (“LIFO”) method which are valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. LIFO method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under LIFO approximates market. The majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and weighted average purchase prices. Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, total inventories, net were $16.7 billion on our consolidated balance sheets. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 60% and 62% of our inventories at March 31, 2020 and 2019. If we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately $444 million and $696 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2020 and 2019. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. We recognized LIFO credits of $252 million, $210 million and $99 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018 in our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. In determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that the Company obtains control of the acquired business. Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use a method that is a form or variation of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life. Refer to Financial Note 5, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9.4 billion of goodwill at March 31, 2020 and 2019, and $3.2 billion and $3.7 billion of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2020 and 2019. On October 1, 2019, we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 to better align with the timing of our annual long-term planning process. This change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge. Refer to Note 14, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. 40Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.In 2018, we elected to early adopt, on a prospective basis, the amended guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the second step of the impairment test. The one-step impairment test under the amended guidance requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, if any, up to the amount of goodwill the entity has recorded. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rates or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. Under the market approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit. Under the income approach, significant estimates and assumptions also includes the determination of discount rates. The discount rates represent the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing, which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital structure. Included in the estimate of the weighted average cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections. An increase in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate.Based on the 2019 annual goodwill impairment tests, the estimated fair values of our reporting units excluding the Retail Pharmacy (formerly, Consumer Solutions) and Pharmaceutical Distribution (formerly, Pharmacy Solutions) reporting units in our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment exceeded their carrying values. However, other risks, expenses and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty and material changes in key market assumptions that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise the projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods. The estimated fair value of our McKesson Canada reporting unit within Other exceeded the carrying value of this reporting unit by 11% in 2020. The goodwill balance of this reporting unit was $1.4 billion at March 31, 2020 or approximately 15% of the consolidated goodwill balance. Generally, a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of 12% or an increase in the discount rate in excess of 1% could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit in future reporting periods. Refer to Financial Note 14, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Currently, all of our intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 38 years. We review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.41Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Refer to Financial Note 4, “Restructuring, Impairment and Related Charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Equity Method Investments: We evaluate our investments for other-than-temporary impairments when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether a loss in value of an investment is other than temporary including: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost; the financial condition of the investees, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of value. Management makes certain judgments and estimates in its assessment including but not limited to: identifying if circumstances indicate a decline in value is other than temporary, expectations about the business operations of investees, as well as industry, financial and market factors. Any significant changes in assumptions or judgments in assessing impairments could result in an impairment charge.Restructuring Charges: We have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exit-related costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. We generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred. In connection with these restructuring actions, we also assess the recoverability of long-lived assets used in the business, and as a result, we may recognize accelerated depreciation reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets.Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties and include those used to conclude on the tax-free nature of the separation of the Change Healthcare JV. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations.We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.42Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided.We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. In conjunction with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements, we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party. While we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, consolidated financial position, cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Financial Note 21, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper program, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. As described within “Trends and Uncertainties” above, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly. We continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business, as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us. We remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility. Additionally, long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, have remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are signs of stress in both markets, we do not have an immediate need to access these markets and could use our revolving credit facility to meet any near-term liquidity needs. We have seen some improvement in conditions in the debt markets and commercial paper markets as the Federal Reserve has taken steps to stabilize the markets. We believe we have the ability to meet the covenants of our credit agreements.43Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The following table summarizes the net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the periods shown: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2020 2019 2018 2020 2019Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$4,374 $4,036 $4,345 $338 $(309)Investing activities(579) (1,381) (2,993) 802 1,612Financing activities(2,734) (2,227) (3,084) (507) 857Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(19) (119) 150 100 (269)Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$1,042 $309 $(1,582) $733 $1,891Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided from operating activities was $4.4 billion, $4.0 billion and $4.3 billion for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements and vendor payment terms. Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2020 were affected by increases in drafts and accounts payable primarily associated with timing, replenishing inventory stocks and effective working capital management, and an increase in receivables primarily due to revenue growth. Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2019 were primarily affected by an increase in receivables due to the overall increase in sales volume and timing of receipts, and increases in drafts and accounts payable, primarily due to increased inventory purchases and timing of payments. Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2018 were primarily affected by a decrease in receivables primarily due to timing of receipts and loss of customers, and increases in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases. During the year ended March 31, 2020, we made a cash payment of $114 million from the executive benefit retirement plan. Other non-cash items within operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2020 primarily includes fair value remeasurement charges of $275 million related to our German wholesale business to be contributed to a joint venture, a pension settlement charge of $122 million and stock-based compensation of $119 million.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $579 million, $1.4 billion and $3.0 billion for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2018 also include $1.7 billion of cash paid for stock repurchases, $262 million of dividends paid and $112 million of payments for debt extinguishment. Share Repurchase PlansThe Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, ASR programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.In 2018, we repurchased 3.5 million of our shares through open market transactions and 6.7 million of our shares through ASR programs. We received an additional 1.0 million shares in the first quarter of 2019 under the March 2018 ASR program. In 2019, we repurchased 10.4 million of our shares through open market transactions and 2.1 million of our shares through the December 2018 ASR program.In 2019, we retired 5.0 million or $542 million of the Company’s treasury shares previously repurchased. Under the applicable state law, these shares resume the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. In accordance with our accounting policy, we allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. Accordingly, our retained earnings and additional paid-in capital were reduced by $472 million and $70 million during 2019.In 2020, we repurchased 9.2 million of the Company’s shares for $1.3 billion through open market transactions at an average price per share of $144.68. We also entered into an ASR program with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $600 million of the Company’s common stock. The total number of shares repurchased under this ASR program was 4.7 million shares at an average price per share of $127.68.On March 9, 2020, we completed the Split-off of our interest in the Change Healthcare JV. In connection with the Split-off, we distributed all 176.0 million outstanding shares of SpinCo common stock, which held all of the Company’s interests in the Change Healthcare JV, to participating holders of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 15.4 million shares of McKesson stock, which are now held as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheet. Following consummation of the exchange offer, on March 10, 2020, SpinCo merged with and into Change with each share of SpinCo common stock converted into one share of Change common stock, par value $0.001 per share, with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of Change common stock.

However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. As described within “Trends and Uncertainties” above, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly. We continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business, as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions, except ratios)2020 2019 2018Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$4,023 $2,981 $2,672 Working capital(402) 839 451 Debt to capital ratio (1)52.1% 43.3% 40.6%Return on McKesson stockholders’ equity (2)13.3% 0.4% 0.6%(1)Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).(2)Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests.Cash equivalents, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA-rated U.S. government money market funds and overnight deposits with financial institutions. Deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollars. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 included approximately $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. Following enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the repatriation of cash to the United States is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and other current liabilities. We require a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to increase the variations in our working capital, which we will continue to monitor closely.Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in drafts and accounts payable and an increase in the current portion of long-term debt for term notes due in 2021, partially offset by an increase in receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories and a decrease in current portion of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable. Our debt to capital ratio increased for 2020 primarily due to decrease in stockholders’ equity driven by the Split-off of our interest in Change Healthcare JV and share repurchases. Our debt to capital ratio increased for 2019 primarily due to a decrease in stockholder’s equity driven by share repurchases.In July 2019, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.39 to $0.41 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. Dividends were $1.62 per share in 2020, $1.51 per share in 2019 and $1.30 per share in 2018. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid total cash dividends of $294 million, $292 million and $262 million. Additionally, as required under the Domination Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe.46Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Contractual Obligations:The table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2020: Years(In millions)Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5On balance sheet Long-term debt (1)$7,387 $1,052 $1,517 $1,128 $3,690Operating lease obligations (2) 2,274 398 681 465 730Other (3) 284 39 64 50 131 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (4)1,824 228 384 298 914Purchase obligations (5)6,964 6,889 48 27 —Other (6)403 222 30 42 109Total$19,136 $8,828 $2,724 $2,010 $5,574(1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of finance lease obligations.(2)Represents undiscounted minimum operating lease obligations under non-cancelable operating leases having an initial remaining term over one year and is not adjusted for imputed interest.

The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.Our banks and insurance companies have issued $170 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at March 31, 2020. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.The carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to McKesson Europe was $1.4 billion at March 31, 2020, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.2 billion. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement on December 2, 2014, the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe received a put right that enables them to put their McKesson Europe shares to McKesson at €22.99 per share, which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published semiannually by the German Bundesbank, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid (“Put Amount”). The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the Put Amount are uncertain. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (the “Compensation Amount”) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the Domination Agreement. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. The Domination Agreement does not expire, but it may be terminated at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least six month’s advance notice.Refer to Financial Note 9, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.47Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuances.

Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $4.0 billion and $3.0 billion and in cash and cash equivalents. The effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2020 and 2019 of approximately $6.0 million and $4.0 million.Foreign exchange risk: We conduct our business worldwide in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollars. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in U.S. dollars. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies.We have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. The forward contracts and cross-currency swaps are designated to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk.As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $435 million and $581 million. However, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Refer to Financial Note 18, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps.The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.49Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:32.365803

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean our fiscal year.Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to these statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 29Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Overview of Our Business:We are a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information solutions. We partner with life sciences companies, manufacturers, providers, pharmacies, governments, and other healthcare organizations to help provide the right medicines, medical products, and healthcare services to the right patients at the right time, safely, and cost-effectively. We implemented a new segment reporting structure commencing with the second quarter of 2021, which resulted in four reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical, International, Medical-Surgical Solutions, and Prescription Technology Solutions (“RxTS”). Other, for retrospective periods presented, consists of our equity method investment in Change Healthcare LLC (“Change Healthcare JV”), which was split-off from McKesson in the fourth quarter of 2020. All prior segment information has been recast to reflect our new segment structure and current period presentation. Our organizational structure also includes Corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects, and the results of certain investments. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit before interest expense and income taxes. The following summarizes our four reportable segments and the changes made to our reporting structure commencing in the second quarter of 2021. Refer to Financial Note 22, “Segments of Business,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our reportable segments. •U.S. Pharmaceutical, previously the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions reportable segment, continues to distribute branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare-related products. This segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate site) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services.•International is a new reportable segment that includes our operations in Europe and Canada, bringing together non-U.S.-based drug distribution services, specialty pharmacy, retail, and infusion care services. McKesson Europe was previously reflected as the European Pharmaceutical Solutions reportable segment and McKesson Canada was previously included in Other.•Medical-Surgical Solutions provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers in the United States (“U.S.”) and was unaffected by the segment realignment.•RxTS is a new reportable segment that brings together existing businesses, including CoverMyMeds, RelayHealth, RxCrossroads, and McKesson Prescription Automation, including Multi-Client Central Fill as a Service, to serve our biopharma and life sciences partners and patients. RxCrossroads was previously included in our former U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions reportable segment and CoverMyMeds, RelayHealth, and McKesson Prescription Automation were previously included in Other.30Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Executive Summary:The following summary provides highlights and key factors that impacted our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2021. •Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) impacted our results of operations for the year ended March 31, 2021. Following the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) on March 11, 2020, there was a temporary increase in demand for pharmaceuticals across our businesses. Subsequently, pharmaceutical distribution volumes decreased during the first quarter as a result of the weakened and uncertain global economic environment and COVID-19 restrictions, including government shutdowns and shelter-in-place orders. The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continued to fluctuate throughout our fiscal year. We benefited from demand for COVID-19 tests, favorable contributions from our vaccine and related ancillary supply kit distribution programs as discussed further below, and savings from reduced travel and meetings throughout 2021;•We expanded our existing contractual relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) through an amendment to our existing Vaccines for Children Program contract to support the U.S. government as a centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines. We have also partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and Pfizer to manage the assembly and distribution of the ancillary supplies needed to administer COVID-19 vaccines; •In December 2020, we began distributing certain COVID-19 vaccines under the direction of the CDC. Through the end of the fiscal year, we had distributed approximately 100 million of COVID-19 vaccine doses. For a more in-depth discussion of how COVID-19 impacted our business, operations, and outlook, refer to the COVID-19 section of ""Trends and Uncertainties"" included below;•Revenues of $238.2 billion, reflects a 3% increase from the prior year primarily in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment driven by market growth;•Gross profit increased 1% from the prior year primarily in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment driven by sales of COVID-19 tests;•Total operating expenses in 2021 includes the following: ◦a charge of $8.1 billion related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims as further described in the Opioid-Related Litigation and Claims section of “Trends and Uncertainties” included below; and◦charges of $115 million to impair certain long-lived assets within our International segment; partially offset by◦a net gain of $131 million recorded in connection with insurance proceeds received from the settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to our controlled substances monitoring program;•Other income, net in 2021 includes net gains of $133 million related to our equity investments;•Diluted loss per common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation in 2021 of $28.26 reflects the aforementioned items, net of any respective tax impacts, and a lower share count compared to the prior year driven largely by the separation of our investment in Change Healthcare JV on March 10, 2020;•On November 1, 2020, we completed the contribution of our German pharmaceutical wholesale business to a newly formed joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance (“WBA”) in which we have a 30% ownership interest; •On December 3, 2020, we completed a public offering of 0.90% Notes due December 3, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) in a principal amount of $500 million and repaid $1.0 billion of long-term debt in 2021. Refer to Financial Note 13, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information;•We returned $1.0 billion of cash to shareholders through $770 million of common stock repurchases, including the value of equity awards surrendered for tax withholding, and $276 million of dividend payments during 2021. On July 29, 2020, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.41 to $0.42 per common share; and•In January 2021, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an increase of $2.0 billion for the authorized share repurchase of McKesson’s common stock. 31Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Trends and Uncertainties:COVID-19 In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China. The WHO declared COVID-19 a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” on January 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impacts COVID-19 has on our business and operations. The pandemic developed rapidly during our fourth quarter of 2020 and continued to evolve throughout 2021. Infection rates varied throughout our fiscal year, peaking in January 2021. A significant number of new COVID-19 cases continue to be reported, particularly in the U.S. These also include cases from new and emerging COVID-19 variants, which could have the potential to be more severe, spread more easily, require different treatments, or change the effectiveness of current vaccines. However, vaccines which have met the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA’s”) standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”), are currently being administered across the country, as further discussed below. As of March 31, 2021, nearly 154 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the U.S. according to the CDC. The full extent to which COVID-19 will impact us depends on many factors and future developments, which are described at the end of this COVID-19 section.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local government directives and policies have been put in place in the U.S. to enhance availability of medications and supplies to meet the increased demand, assist front-line healthcare providers, manage public health concerns by creating social distancing, and address the economic impacts, including sharply reduced business activity, increased unemployment, and overall uncertainty presented by this healthcare emergency. Similar governmental actions have occurred in Canada and Europe, the timing of which has varied across geographies. In December 2020, the FDA issued an EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer Vaccine”) and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc. (“Moderna Vaccine”) to be distributed in the U.S. These authorizations were followed by an EUA for the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Janssen Biotech Inc., a Janssen pharmaceutical company of Johnson & Johnson, (“Janssen Vaccine”) in February 2021. Government-coordinated administrative or allocation decisions at the federal, state, and local levels may cause variability in the timing and volume of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration activities. Our role in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. as well as the assembly and distribution of related ancillary supply kits is discussed further below. Similar COVID-19 vaccine authorizations have occurred in Canada and Europe. McKesson Canada’s corporately owned retail pharmacy chain, Rexall, as well as independent pharmacy banners are supporting Canada’s vaccination efforts. McKesson Europe is also playing a role in helping support governments and public health entities in not only distributing COVID-19 vaccines across several European countries, but administering them in pharmacies as well.As a global leader in healthcare supply chain management solutions, retail pharmacy, community oncology and specialty care, and healthcare information solutions, we are well positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. We have worked and continue to work closely with national and local governments, agencies, and industry partners to ensure that available supplies, including personal protective equipment (“PPE”), and medicine reach our customers and patients. 32Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Our Response to COVID-19 in the WorkplaceDuring this unprecedented time, we are committed in continuing to supply our customers and protect the safety of our employees. The various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations, including telecommuting and work-from-home policies, restricted travel, employee support programs, and enhanced safety measures, are intended to limit employee exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. We expanded employee medical benefits covering COVID-19 related visits, treatments, and testing as well as expanded telehealth options to protect employee safety. We provided further support including additional emergency leave and an internal paid time off donation platform for employees impacted by COVID-19. For employees whose roles require presence at our facilities, we enhanced safety by promoting the practice of social distancing, providing reminders to wash or disinfect hands and avoid unnecessary face touching, making face masks available, placing hand sanitizers within our operating environments, and periodically cleaning and disinfecting our facilities. For employees whose roles do not require presence at our facilities, we added technology resources to support their working remotely. These responses were initially put in place during our fourth quarter of 2020. During the second quarter of 2021, we also implemented on-site workplace temperature screening as we continue to adapt our health and safety practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. When working in frozen vaccine storage environments, employees are provided with protective gear, including special clothing, gloves, and facial gear. These steps to protect employee safety have resulted in limited disruption from COVID-19 to our normal business operations, productivity trends, and have not materially impacted our operating expenses or operating margins.We have evaluated the impact of our telecommuting and work-from-home policies on our system of internal controls and we have concluded that these policies did not have a material effect on our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended March 31, 2021. We also took various actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our results from operations through cost-containment and payroll-related expenses.Trends in our BusinessAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic late in our fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes and increased retail pharmacy foot traffic as our customers increased supplies on hand in March, which drove unfavorability in our results of operations when comparing 2021 versus 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced growth in pharmaceutical distribution and specialty drug volumes at a lower rate in the U.S., while pharmaceutical distribution volumes decreased in Europe and Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to the same prior year period. Specialty drug volumes increased, but were negatively impacted by lower demand for elective specialty drugs, as compared to the same prior year period. We also experienced decreased demand for primary care medical-surgical supplies due to deferrals in elective procedures in hospitals and surgery centers as well as decreased traffic and closures of doctors’ offices, which was partially offset by demand for PPE and COVID-19 tests. Additionally, the decreased traffic in doctors’ offices and general shelter-in-place guidance by governmental authorities negatively impacted retail pharmacy foot traffic in both Europe and Canada. While we experienced improvements in prescription volumes and primary care patient visits during our second quarter of 2021, the impact and recovery of COVID-19 for the second half of our fiscal year was non-linear and tracked with patient mobility. We also saw increased demand for COVID-19 tests and continued sales of PPE throughout the year in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment partially offset by the impacts of social distancing measures which resulted in a less severe cough, cold, and flu season, savings for reduced travel and meetings across the enterprise, as well as improvements of retail pharmacy foot traffic in Europe and Canada. The vaccine and related ancillary kit distribution in the U.S. favorably impacted our results in the second half of fiscal 2021 as further discussed below. 33Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Our Role in the Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines and Ancillary Supply KitsOn August 14, 2020, we expanded our contractual relationship with the CDC through an amendment to our existing Vaccines for Children Program contract for the distribution of certain COVID-19 vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccine distribution agreement with the CDC was finalized during the third quarter of 2021. We support the U.S. government as a centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines. In the centralized model, the U.S. government directs us on the distribution of the vaccines and related supplies to point-of-care sites across the country. We make no decisions on where products are to be distributed nor how the products are allocated between the various provider sites and ultimately administered to the individuals receiving a vaccine. We utilize our expertise and capabilities to support the CDC’s efforts to vaccinate everyone in the U.S. who wants to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC and McKesson collaborated similarly in response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. In December 2020, we began distributing the Moderna Vaccine in the U.S. and in March 2021, we began distributing the Janssen Vaccine. We may distribute other future authorized COVID-19 vaccines that are refrigerated or frozen. Ancillary supply kits may be shipped either together with the Moderna Vaccine and Janssen Vaccine or in advance of the vaccines. The results of operations related to our vaccine distribution are reflected in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. The Pfizer Vaccine, which is ultra-frozen, is not being distributed by McKesson, although we are providing ancillary supplies needed for its administration. On September 23, 2020, we announced our contract with the HHS under which our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment manages the assembly and distribution of ancillary supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccines, including sourcing some of those supplies. We also have an agreement with Pfizer to assemble and distribute ancillary supply kits needed to administer that particular COVID-19 vaccine. Ancillary supply kits include alcohol prep pads, face shields, surgical masks, needles and syringes, and other vaccine administration items. For the Pfizer Vaccine, ancillary supply kits also include the diluent needed to administer the ultra-frozen vaccine. We began assembling the ancillary supply kits in September 2020 in preparation for vaccine authorization and subsequent distribution. Ancillary supply kits to administer the Pfizer Vaccine are shipped directly to point-of-care sites, and all other ancillary supply kits are shipped to our dedicated vaccine distribution centers. The results of operations for the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies are reflected in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. The future financial impact of the arrangements with the CDC and HHS depend on numerous uncertainties, which are described at the end of this COVID-19 section.To manage the COVID-19 vaccine and ancillary supply kit distribution, we have set up special, dedicated vaccine distribution centers that include large-scale, custom freezers and refrigerators to safely store and process millions of vaccine doses. These facilities can scale to meet the demand of increasing volumes of vaccines being manufactured. We have also set up distribution centers for kitting and inventory management as part of our contract with the HHS. We are working with delivery partners to manage the delivery of vaccines and ancillary supply kits from our centralized vaccine distribution centers to point-of-care destinations as directed by the CDC. The capital expenditures we made during 2021 to prepare for vaccine and ancillary supply kit distribution were not material to our financial condition or liquidity.34Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Impact to our Results of Operations, Financial Condition, and LiquidityFor the year ended March 31, 2021, the demand for COVID-19 tests, the year over year impact from PPE and other related products, net of inventory charges, as well as the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment contributed approximately 20% in segment revenues and segment operating profit. Additionally, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment contributed approximately 2% in segment operating profit for the year ended March 31, 2021. During our fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced a temporary increase in demand for pharmaceuticals. Subsequently, during the first quarter, we had lower pharmaceutical volumes, specialty drug volumes, and patient care visits that negatively impacted our consolidated revenues and income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended March 31, 2021. During the year ended March 31, 2021, selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses decreased as a result of the pandemic, largely due to savings from restricted travel and decreased meetings. The favorable reduction in selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses was partially offset by increased costs of transport, costs for enhanced procedures to sanitize operating facilities, and costs of providing PPE and other related products for employee use. Additionally, increased costs for certain PPE compressed our margins. Certain PPE items held for resale were valued in our inventory at costs that were inflated by earlier COVID-19 pandemic demand levels. That inventory valuation, if not supported by market resale prices, may be written down to net realizable value. We may also write-off inventory due to decreased customer demand and excess inventory. During the year ended March 31, 2021, we recorded charges totaling $136 million in cost of sales on certain PPE and other related products due to inventory impairments and excess inventory in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. Although market price volatility and changes to anticipated customer demand may require additional write-downs in future periods, we are taking measures to mitigate such risk. Overall, these COVID-19 related items had a net favorable impact on consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. Impacts to future periods due to COVID-19 may differ based on future developments, which is described at the end of this COVID-19 section.We were able to maintain appropriate labor and overall vendor supply levels during the year ended March 31, 2021. Our inventory levels have fluctuated in response to supply availability and customer demand patterns for certain products, with varying inventory level impacts depending on the specific product within our portfolio. We collaborated closely with the federal government and other healthcare stakeholders to source more critical PPE to the U.S. This collaboration expedited the shipment of critical medical supplies to areas hit hardest by COVID-19, as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As our supply levels improve, and the federal government evolves guidance on the prioritization of providers or geographic markets, we will continue to adapt our distribution policies. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the CARES Act provides certain changes to tax laws and includes provisions to provide relief for citizens, companies, healthcare providers and patients, and others. We have deferred certain employer payroll taxes and continue to monitor the potential impact of other tax legislation changes as result of the CARES Act, including refundable payroll tax credits on certain qualified wages. We anticipate changes due to the CARES Act in the timing of certain cash flows, with no material impact to our financial results for the year ended March 31, 2021. On December 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “CA Act”), which enhances and expands certain provisions of the CARES Act. The CA Act did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2021 nor do we currently expect a material impact on our future financial results. Our consolidated balance sheets and ability to maintain financial liquidity remains strong. We have experienced no material impacts to our liquidity or net working capital due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are monitoring our customers closely for changes to their timing of payments or ability to pay amounts owed to us as a result of COVID-19 pandemic impacts to their businesses. We remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility. Long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, have remained open and accessible to us during the COVID-19 pandemic. At March 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future.35Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Impact to our Supply Chain We also continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on our supply chain. Although the availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers, their locations, and the extent to which they are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proactively working with manufacturers, industry partners, and government agencies to meet the needs of our customers during the pandemic. We have assembled a Critical Care Drug Task Force, made up of our procurement specialists, clinical health systems pharmacists, and supply chain professionals, that is focused on securing additional product where available, sourcing back-up products, and protecting our operations across all locations and facilities. We are also working with manufacturers through several channels, including our ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP (“ClarusONE”) and global sourcing teams in London, and our leaders are actively engaged in addressing potential shortages. We have engaged with industry partners and government agencies to gain visibility into supply and demand. Additionally, we have a robust Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Program (“BCRP”) and we have proactively enhanced our BCRP in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to protect the supply chain to minimize disruption in healthcare, protect our customers, ensure the safety and security of our employees and workplaces, and ensure the continuity of critical business processes. The situation remains fluid and we are taking a proactive approach to protect inventory during this crisis and ensure our provider partners have needed supplies and medications to help prevent the spread of the disease and treat those that are ill. COVID-19 has put an unprecedented strain on the supply of high-demand PPE, including N95 masks, gloves, as well as disinfecting sprays and wipes. The supply chain has improved over the initial impact of pandemic-related demand, and we continue to closely monitor demand by customer type and certain PPE and infection prevention items are still in short supply. Our allocation approach has helped us avoid stock outs in many critical product categories, allowing us to provide PPE supplies to many more customers for a much longer time. We anticipate these market conditions will remain for the foreseeable future. Our efforts to help the supply chain have included sourcing products from new suppliers all over the world, working closely with the federal government to help with the nation’s response and collaborating with partners to source, develop, and deliver new products to market. Risks and Forward-Looking InformationThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and exacerbated uncertainties inherent in estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in our forecasts. We face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on our future business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. The full extent to which COVID-19 will impact us depends on many factors and future developments, including: the duration and spread of the virus; governmental actions to limit the spread of the virus; potential seasonality of viral outbreaks; potential new strains or variants of the original virus; the amount of COVID-19 vaccines authorized, manufactured, distributed, and administered; the amount of ancillary supply kits assembled and distributed; the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and governmental measures in controlling the spread of the virus; and the effectiveness of treatments of infected individuals. Due to several rapidly changing variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic, estimations of future economic trends and the timing of when stability will return remains challenging. Additionally, we periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Key assumptions and estimates about future values in our impairment assessments can be affected by a variety of factors, including the impacts of the global pandemic on industry and economic trends as well as on our business strategy and internal forecasts. Material changes to key assumptions and estimates can decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and have resulted in impairment charges of certain long-lived assets as disclosed in Financial Note 4, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and could potentially result in future impairment charges. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a disclosure of risk factors related to COVID-19.36Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Opioid-Related Litigation and Claims We are a defendant in approximately 3,200 legal proceedings asserting claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids) in federal and state courts throughout the U.S., and in Puerto Rico and Canada. Those proceedings include approximately 2,900 federal cases and approximately 300 state court cases throughout the U.S., and cases in Puerto Rico and Canada. We continue to be involved in discussions with the objective of achieving broad resolution of opioid-related claims of states, their political subdivisions and other government entities (“governmental entities”). We are in ongoing, advanced discussions with state attorneys general and plaintiffs’ representatives regarding a framework under which, in order to resolve the claims of governmental entities, the three largest U.S. pharmaceutical distributors would pay up to approximately $21.0 billion over a period of 18 years, with up to approximately $8.0 billion to be paid by us, of which more than 90% is anticipated to be used to remediate the opioids crisis. Most of the remaining amount relates to plaintiffs’ attorneys fees and costs, and would be payable over a shorter time period. In addition, the proposed framework would require the three distributors, including the Company, to adopt changes to anti-diversion programs. We have concluded that discussions under that framework have reached a stage at which a broad settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is probable, and the loss related thereto can be reasonably estimated as of March 31, 2021. As a result of that conclusion, and our assessment of certain other opioid-related claims, we recorded a charge of $8.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2021 within “Claims and litigation charges, net” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, related to our share of the settlement framework described above, as well as other opioid-related claims. Because of the many uncertainties associated with any potential settlement arrangement or other resolution of opioid-related litigation, including the uncertainty of the scope of participation by plaintiffs in any potential settlement, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters. In light of the uncertainty of the timing of amounts that would be paid with respect to the charge, the charge was recorded in “Long-term litigation liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021. Moreover, in light of this uncertainty, the amount of any ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued. While we continue to be involved in discussions regarding a potential broad settlement framework, we also continue to prepare for trial in these pending matters. We believe that we have valid defenses to the claims pending against us and, absent an acceptable settlement, intend to vigorously defend against all such claims. An adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations. Refer to Financial Note 19, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for more information. State Opioid Statutes Legislative, regulatory, or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. In April 2018, the State of New York adopted the Opioid Stewardship Act (“OSA”) which required the imposition of an annual surcharge on all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in New York. On December 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York found the law unconstitutional and issued an injunction preventing the State of New York from enforcing the law. The State of New York appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The State of New York has subsequently adopted an excise tax on sales of opioids in the State, which became effective July 1, 2019. The law adopting the excise tax made clear that the OSA would apply only to opioid sales on or before December 31, 2018. The excise tax applies only to the first sale occurring in New York, and thus may not apply to sales from our distribution centers in New York to New York customers. On September 14, 2020, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court’s decision on procedural grounds. The Healthcare Distribution Alliance filed a petition for panel rehearing, or, in the alternative, for rehearing en banc with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; that petition was denied on December 18, 2020. On February 12, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted a motion by the Healthcare Distribution Alliance to stay its mandate pending the filing and disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari before the U.S. Supreme Court. The due date for filing such a petition is May 17, 2021. Unless the appellate court’s decision is overturned, the OSA will be reinstated for calendar years 2017 and 2018 (but not beyond those years), and, subject to any further legal challenge, we will have to pay our ratable share of the annual surcharge for those two years. During the second quarter of 2021, we reflected an estimated liability of $50 million for the OSA surcharge in our accompanying consolidated financial statements on the assumption that the appellate court’s decision will stand. Refer to Note 19, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for more information.37Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Consolidated Results:(In millions, except per share data)Years Ended March 31, Change20212020201920212020Revenues$238,228 $231,051 $214,319 3 %8 %Gross profit12,148 12,023 11,754 1 2 Gross profit margin5.10 %5.20 %5.48 %(10)bp(28)bpTotal operating expenses$(17,188)$(9,534)$(10,868)80 %(12)%Total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues7.21 %4.13 %5.07 %308 bp(94)bpOther income, net$223 $12 $182 NM (93)%Equity earnings and charges from investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture— (1,108)(194)(100)471 Interest expense(217)(249)(264)(13)(6)Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes(5,034)1,144 610 (540)88 Income tax benefit (expense)695 (18)(356)NM (95)Income (loss) from continuing operations(4,339)1,126 254 (485)343 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax(1)(6)1 (83)(700)Net income (loss)(4,340)1,120 255 (488)339 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests(199)(220)(221)(10)- Net income (loss) attributable to McKesson Corporation$(4,539)$900 $34 (604)%NM Diluted earnings (loss) per common share attributable to McKesson CorporationContinuing operations$(28.26)$4.99 $0.17 (666)%NM Discontinued operations— (0.04)— (100)NM Total$(28.26)$4.95 $0.17 (671)%NM Weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding160.6 181.6 197.3 (12)%(8)%bp - basis points NM - computation not meaningful 38Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Revenues Revenues increased for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 compared to the respective prior years primarily due to market growth, including expanded business with existing customers, within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases, and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with branded to generic drug conversion. Gross Profit Gross profit increased for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the prior year primarily in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment driven by the demand for COVID-19 tests and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from PPE and other related products largely due to inventory charges. Gross profit was favorably impacted by growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and the contribution from our vaccine distribution programs in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Gross profit was unfavorably impacted by the adverse impacts from COVID-19 largely during the first quarter of 2021, including disruptions of doctors’ office operations, deferred or cancelled elective procedures, lower demand for pharmaceuticals, and overall reduction of foot traffic in pharmacies. Gross profit increased for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, partially offset by unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Gross profit and gross profit margin for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year were unfavorably impacted by lower gains from antitrust legal settlements, partially offset by higher last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) credits in 2020. The impact from COVID-19 increased gross profit by less than 1% and decreased gross profit margin by less than 10 basis points for the year ended March 31, 2020.Gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 included LIFO inventory credits of $38 million, $252 million, and $210 million, respectively. The lower LIFO credits in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to higher brand inflation and delays of branded off-patent to generic drug launches. The higher LIFO credits in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily driven by higher generic deflation. Refer to the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section included in this Financial Review for further information. Gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 also included net cash proceeds received of $181 million, $22 million, and $202 million, respectively, representing our share of antitrust legal settlements.Total Operating Expenses A summary and description of the components of our total operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows: •Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses (“SDG&A”): SDG&A consists of personnel costs, transportation costs, depreciation and amortization, lease costs, professional fee expenses, and administrative expenses.•Claims and litigation charges, net: These charges include adjustments for estimated probable settlements related to our controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. Legal fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred, are included within SDG&A. We have reclassified prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation.•Goodwill impairments charges: We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the third quarter and more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. The resulting goodwill impairment charges are reflected within this line item. •Restructuring, impairment, and related charges: Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as well as long-lived asset impairments. 39Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)20212020201920212020Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses$8,849 $9,182 $8,437 (4)%9 %Claims and litigation charges, net7,936 82 37 NM 122 Goodwill impairment charges69 2 1,797 NM (100)Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net334 268 597 25 (55)Total operating expenses$17,188 $9,534 $10,868 80 %(12)%Percent of revenues7.21 %4.13 %5.07 %308 bp(94)bpbp - basis points NM - computation not meaningful Total operating expenses and total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased for the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, and decreased for the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.

(“Change”);•Goodwill impairment charges of $1.8 billion in our European Retail Pharmacy (“European RP”) and European Pharmaceutical Distribution (“European PD”) reporting units within the International segment. Of these impairment charges, $238 million was recognized upon the 2019 first quarter segment changes, which resulted in two new reporting units. The remaining charges primarily were due to declines in the reporting units’ estimated future cash flows and the selection of higher discount rates. These impairment charges generally were not deductible for income tax purposes. The declines in estimated future cash flows primarily were attributed to additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures within the U.K. The risk of successfully achieving certain business initiatives was the primary factor in the use of a higher discount rate. At March 31, 2019, both the European RP and European PD reporting units had no remaining goodwill balances; and•Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net primarily includes employee severance and exit-related costs of $352 million for our 2019 restructuring initiatives, as further discussed below and long-lived asset impairment charges of $245 million primarily for our U.K. business (mainly pharmacy licenses) within our International segment driven by additional government reimbursement reductions and competitive pressures in the U.K.Goodwill ImpairmentsAs discussed in the “Overview of Our Business” section, our operating structure was realigned commencing in the second quarter of 2021 into four reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical, International, Medical-Surgical Solutions, and RxTS. These reportable segments encompass all operating segments of the Company. The second quarter segment realignment resulted in changes in multiple reporting units across the Company. As a result, we were required to perform a goodwill impairment test for these reporting units and recorded a goodwill impairment charge in our European RP reporting unit of $69 million during the second quarter of 2021. At March 31, 2021, the balance of goodwill for our reporting units in Europe was approximately nil and the remaining balance of goodwill in the International segment primarily relates to one of our reporting units in Canada. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, and at an interim date, if indicators of potential impairment exist. The annual impairment testing performed in 2021 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. As of the testing date, other risks, expenses, and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods, including our McKesson Canada reporting unit within our International segment and our RxCrossroads reporting unit within our RxTS segment, where the risk of a material goodwill impairment is higher than other reporting units. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in this Financial Review for further information.41Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)On October 1, 2019, we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from January 1 to October 1 to better align with the timing of our annual long-term planning process. This change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge. Refer to Note 12, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.Restructuring Initiatives and Long-Lived Asset Impairments During the first quarter of 2022, we approved an initiative to increase operational efficiencies and flexibility by transitioning to a partial remote work model for certain employees. This initiative primarily led us to rationalize our office space in North America. Where we determine to cease using office space, we plan to exit the portion of the facility no longer used. We also may retain and repurpose certain other office locations. We expect to incur total charges of approximately $180 million to $280 million for this initiative, consisting primarily of exit related costs, accelerated depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, and asset impairments. This initiative is expected to be completed in 2022.During the first quarter of 2021, we committed to an initiative within the U.K., which is included in our International segment, to further drive transformational changes in technologies and business processes, operational efficiencies, and cost savings. The initiative includes reducing the number of retail pharmacy stores, decommissioning obsolete technologies and processes, reorganizing and consolidating certain business operations, and related headcount reductions. We expect to incur total charges of approximately $85 million to $90 million, of which $57 million of charges were recorded to date. The initiative is expected to be substantially complete in 2022 and estimated remaining charges primarily consist of accelerated amortization of long-lived assets, facility and other exit costs, and employee-related costs.In the fourth quarter of 2019, we committed to certain programs to continue our operating model and cost optimization efforts. We continue to implement centralization of certain functions and outsourcing through an expanded arrangement with a third-party vendor to achieve operational efficiency. The programs also include reorganization and consolidation of business operations, related headcount reductions, the further closures of retail pharmacy stores in Europe, and closures of other facilities. Total charges of $297 million were recorded to date. This initiative was substantially complete in 2021 and remaining costs we expect to record under this initiative are not material. We also committed to certain actions in connection with the previously announced relocation of our corporate headquarters from San Francisco, California to Irving, Texas, which became effective April 1, 2019. Total charges of $105 million were recorded to date. The relocation was substantially complete in January 2021 and remaining costs we expect to record under this initiative, primarily relating to lease costs, are not material.In the second quarter of 2018, we committed to a restructuring plan, which primarily consisted of the closures of underperforming retail pharmacy stores in the U.K., and a reduction in workforce. The plan was substantially complete in 2020.On April 25, 2018, we announced a strategic growth initiative intended to drive long-term incremental profit growth and to increase operational efficiency. The initiative consisted of multiple growth priorities and plans to optimize our operating models and cost structures primarily through centralization, cost management, and outsourcing of certain administrative functions. As part of the growth initiative, we committed to implement certain actions including a reduction in workforce, facility consolidation, and store closures. This set of initiatives was substantially complete by the end of 2020.Restructuring, impairment, and related charges for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 also includes long-lived asset impairment charges of $115 million, $112 million, and $245 million, respectively, primarily related to our retail pharmacy businesses in Canada and Europe within our International segment. In addition, certain charges related to restructuring initiatives are included under the caption “Cost of sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were not material for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.Refer to Financial Note 4, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.42Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Other Income, Net Other income, net for the year ended March 31, 2021 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to net gains recognized from our equity investments of $133 million. This primarily reflects mark-to-market gains on our investments in certain U.S. growth stage companies in the healthcare industry and realized gains on the exit of some of these investments as further described in Financial Note 17, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In future periods, fair value adjustments recognized in our operating results for these types of investments may be adversely impacted by market volatility. Other income, net also increased year over year due to pension settlement charges of $122 million recognized in 2020 related to our previously approved termination of the frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan. In connection with the pension plan termination, we purchased annuity contracts from an insurer that will pay and administer the future pension benefits of the remaining participants. Other income, net, for the year ended March 31, 2020 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the 2020 pension settlement charges described above and higher gains recognized from the sale of investments in 2019, partially offset by higher net settlement gains in 2020 from our derivative contracts. Equity Earnings and Charges from Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture Until the separation of our investment in Change Healthcare JV on March 10, 2020, we accounted for this investment using the equity method of accounting. Excluding the impairment and transaction-related items described below, our proportionate share of loss from our investment in Change Healthcare JV for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 was $119 million and $194 million, respectively, which primarily includes transaction and integration expenses incurred by the joint venture and basis differences between the joint venture and McKesson including amortization of fair value adjustments. During the first quarter of 2020 and for the year ended March 31, 2019, we owned approximately 70% of this joint venture. On June 27, 2019, common stock and certain other securities of Change began trading on the NASDAQ (“IPO”). On July 1, 2019, upon the completion of its IPO, Change contributed net cash proceeds it received from its offering of common stock to Change Healthcare JV in exchange for additional membership interests of Change Healthcare JV at the equivalent of its offering price of $13 per share. The proceeds from the concurrent offering of other securities were also used by Change to acquire certain securities of Change Healthcare JV. As a result, McKesson’s equity interest in Change Healthcare JV was reduced from 70% to approximately 58.5%, which was used to recognize our proportionate share in net loss from Change Healthcare JV, commencing in the second quarter of 2020. As a result of the ownership dilution to 58.5% from 70%, we recognized a dilution loss of approximately $246 million in the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, our proportionate share of income or loss from this investment was subsequently reduced as immaterial settlements of stock option exercises occurred after the IPO and further diluted our ownership.In the second quarter of 2020, we recorded an other-than-temporary-impairment (“OTTI”) charge of $1.2 billion to our investment in Change Healthcare JV, representing the difference between the carrying value of our investment and the fair value derived from the corresponding closing price of Change’s common stock at September 30, 2019. This charge was included within “Equity earnings and charges from investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended March 31, 2020. On March 10, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our interest in Change Healthcare JV, which eliminated our investment in the joint venture. The separation was effected through the split-off of PF2 SpinCo, Inc. (“SpinCo”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that held all of our interest in Change Healthcare JV, to certain of our stockholders through an exchange offer (“Split-off”), followed by the merger of SpinCo with and into Change, with Change surviving the merger (“Merger”). 43Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)In connection with the exchange offer, on March 9, 2020, we distributed all 176.0 million outstanding shares of common stock of SpinCo to participating holders of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 15.4 million shares of McKesson common stock. Following consummation of the exchange offer, on March 10, 2020, the Merger was consummated, with each share of SpinCo common stock converted into one share of Change common stock, par value $0.001 per share, with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of Change common stock. The Split-off and Merger are intended to be generally tax-free transactions to McKesson and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Following the Split-off, we do not beneficially own any of Change’s outstanding securities. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a net gain for financial reporting purposes of $414 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, which was largely driven by the reversal of a related deferred tax liability. Under the agreement with Change Healthcare JV, McKesson, Change, and certain subsidiaries of the Change Healthcare JV, there may be changes in future periods to the amount reversed. Any such change is not expected to be material.After the separation, Change Healthcare JV is required under the TRA to pay McKesson 85% of the net cash tax savings realized, or deemed to be realized, resulting from depreciation or amortization allocated to Change by McKesson. The receipt of any payments under the TRA is dependent upon Change benefiting from this depreciation or amortization in future tax return filings, which creates uncertainty over the amount, timing and probability of the gain recognized. As such, we accounted for the TRA as a gain contingency, with no receivable recognized as of March 31, 2021 nor 2020. Interest ExpenseInterest expense decreased in 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to the repayment of $1.0 billion of long-term debt in the third quarter of 2021 and a decrease in the issuance of commercial paper. Interest expense decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the issuance of commercial paper, partially offset by a decrease in interest income from our derivative contracts. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.Income Tax (Benefit) Expense We recorded income tax (benefit) expense of ($695 million), $18 million, and $356 million for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our reported income tax (benefit) expense rates were (13.8%), 1.6%, and 58.4% in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our reported income tax rate for 2021 was impacted by the charge for opioid-related claims of $8.1 billion ($6.8 billion after-tax). Our reported income tax expense rate for 2020 was favorably impacted by a net gain on the Change Healthcare JV divestiture of $414 million (pre-tax and after-tax), which was intended to generally be a tax-free split-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and unfavorably impacted by charges of $275 million (pre-tax and after-tax) to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to fair value less costs to sell related to the completed contribution of the majority of our German pharmaceutical wholesale business to create a joint venture with WBA. Refer to Financial Note 2,“Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture” and Note 3,“Held for Sale,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for more information. Our reported income tax expense rate for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by charges of $1.8 billion (pre-tax and after-tax) to impair the carrying value of goodwill of our European RP and European PD reporting units within the International segment, given that these charges are generally not deductible for tax purposes. Refer to Financial Note 12, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties. 44Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $(1) million, $(6) million, and $1 million for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents ClarusONE, Vantage Oncology Holdings, LLC, and the accrual of the annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe AG (“McKesson Europe”) share that McKesson is obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the December 2014 domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”). Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of McKesson Corporation stockholders’ equity (deficit) on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial Note 9, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to McKesson Corporation Net income (loss) attributable to McKesson Corporation was $(4.5) billion, $900 million, and $34 million for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation was $(28.26), $4.95, and $0.17 for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Net loss per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2021 is calculated by excluding dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effects. Additionally, our 2021, 2020, and 2019 diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect the cumulative effects of share repurchases. Weighted-Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding Diluted earnings (loss) per common share was calculated based on a weighted-average number of shares outstanding of 160.6 million, 181.6 million, and 197.3 million for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding is impacted by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and the cumulative effect of share repurchases, including the impact of shares exchanged as part of the split-off from our investment in Change Healthcare JV, as discussed above.45Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Overview of Segment Results: Segment Revenues: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)20212020201920212020Segment revenuesU.S. Pharmaceutical$189,274 $181,700 $166,189 4 %9 %International35,965 38,341 38,023 (6)1 Medical-Surgical Solutions10,099 8,305 7,618 22 9 Prescription Technology Solutions2,890 2,705 2,489 7 9 Total revenues$238,228 $231,051 $214,319 3 %8 %U.S. Pharmaceutical2021 vs. 2020U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 increased 4% compared to the prior year primarily due to market growth, including branded pharmaceutical price increases, growth in specialty pharmaceuticals, and higher volumes from retail national account customers, partially offset by branded to generic drug conversions.

Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency exchange fluctuations,” which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of our operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In computing the foreign currency exchange fluctuations, we translate our current year results of our operations in foreign countries recorded in local currencies into U.S dollars by applying their respective average foreign currency exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods reported in U.S. dollars. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in Financial Note 22, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Business CombinationsRefer to Financial Note 5, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Fiscal 2022 OutlookInformation regarding the Company’s fiscal 2022 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 6, 2021. That Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in the ""Trends and Uncertainties"" section of this Financial Review, as well as the cautionary statements in Item 1, ""Business - Forward-Looking Statements,"" and Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.The Company considers historical experience, the current economic environment, customer credit ratings or bankruptcies, and reasonable and supportable forecasts to develop its allowance for doubtful accounts. Management reviews these factors quarterly to determine if any adjustments are needed to the allowance. 50Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Sales to the Company’s ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), accounted for approximately 51% of total consolidated revenues in 2021 and comprised approximately 32% of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2021. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 21% of our total consolidated revenues in 2021 and comprised approximately 19% of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2021. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2021 are appropriate and consistent in the context of historical methodologies employed, as well as assessment of trends currently available.At March 31, 2021, trade and notes receivables were $17.5 billion prior to allowances of $211 million. In 2021, 2020 and, 2019, our provision for bad debts was $4 million, $91 million, and $132 million, respectively. At March 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2021 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $18 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst-case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Inventories: Inventories consist of merchandise held for resale. We report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the LIFO method which are valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. LIFO method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under LIFO approximates market. The majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and weighted-average purchase prices. Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. At March 31, 2021 and 2020, total inventories, net were $19.2 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 58% and 60% of our inventories at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately $406 million and $444 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. The lower LIFO credits in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to higher brand inflation and delays of branded off-patent to generic drug launches. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. We recognized LIFO credits of $38 million, $252 million, and $210 million, respectively, in 2021, 2020, and 2019 in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. Excluding LIFO reserves, our inventory reserves as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 were $263 million and $96 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to 2021 charges totaling $136 million on certain PPE and other related products due to inventory impairments and excess inventory within our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.We believe that the moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. 51Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)In determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.Business Combinations: The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that the Company obtains control of the acquired business. Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use a method that is a form or variation of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life. Refer to Financial Note 5, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9.5 billion and $9.4 billion of goodwill at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the third quarter and more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.We apply the goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and recording an impairment charge equal to the amount of excess carrying value above the estimated fair value, if any, but not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.52Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rates or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. Under the market approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit. Under the income approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the determination of discount rates. The discount rates represent the weighted-average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing, which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital structure. Included in the estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections. An increase in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate.Based on the 2019 annual goodwill impairment tests, the estimated fair values of our reporting units, excluding the Europe Retail Pharmacy and Europe Pharmaceutical Distribution reporting units in our International segment, exceeded their carrying values. The impairment testing performed in 2020 did not indicate any material impairment of goodwill. The segment change in the second quarter of 2021 prompted changes in multiple reporting units across the Company. As a result, goodwill included in impacted reporting units was reallocated using a relative fair value approach and assessed for impairment both before and after the reallocation. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $69 million in 2021 as the estimated fair value of the Europe Retail Pharmacy reporting unit was lower than its reassigned carrying value based on changes in the composition of the Europe Retail Pharmacy reporting unit within the International segment. At March 31, 2021, the balance of goodwill for the reporting units in Europe was approximately nil and the remaining balance of goodwill in the International segment primarily relates to one of our reporting units in Canada.The estimated fair values of our McKesson Canada reporting unit in our International segment and our RxCrossroads reporting unit in our RxTS segment exceeded the carrying values of these reporting units by 11% and 14%, respectively, in 2021. The goodwill balance of these reporting units was $1.5 billion for McKesson Canada and $312 million for RxCrossroads at March 31, 2021 or approximately 19% of the consolidated goodwill balance. Generally, a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of 16% for McKesson Canada and 17% for RxCrossroads or an increase in the discount rate in excess of approximately 1.5% could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for these reporting units in future reporting periods. Other risks, expenses and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing date may require us to further revise the projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods. Refer to Financial Note 12, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Currently, all of our intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 38 years. We review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Refer to Financial Note 4, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.53Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Valuation of Equity Method Investments: We evaluate our investments for other-than-temporary impairments when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether a loss in value of an investment is other than temporary including: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition of the investees, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of value. Management makes certain judgments and estimates in its assessment including but not limited to: identifying if circumstances indicate a decline in value is other than temporary, expectations about the business operations of investees, as well as industry, financial, and market factors. Any significant changes in assumptions or judgments in assessing impairments could result in an impairment charge.Restructuring Charges: We have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exit-related costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. We generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred. In connection with these restructuring actions, we also assess the recoverability of long-lived assets used in the business, and as a result, we may recognize accelerated depreciation and amortization reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets.Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties and include those used to conclude on the tax-free nature of the separation of the Change Healthcare JV and the unrecognized tax position related to opioid-related litigation and claims, which remains unfinalized, and which may differ from the actual amounts of tax benefit recognized. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations.We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided.54Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on future negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. In conjunction with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements, we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party. As a result of ongoing, advanced discussions with state attorneys general and plaintiffs’ representatives regarding a framework to resolve the claims of governmental entities, and our assessment of certain other opioid-related claims, we have reached a stage at which a broad settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is probable and recorded a charge of $8.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2021 within “Claims and litigation charges, net” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in this report. Because of the many uncertainties associated with any potential settlement arrangement or other resolution of opioid-related litigation, including the uncertainty of the scope of participation by plaintiffs in any potential settlement, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters. While we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, consolidated financial position, cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Financial Note 19, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper program, will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term capital expenditures, working capital, and other cash requirements. As described within the “Trends and Uncertainties” section above, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop rapidly. We continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business, as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us. We remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. Additionally, long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, have remained open and accessible to us during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen continued improvement in conditions in the debt markets and commercial paper markets as the Federal Reserve has taken steps to stabilize the markets. At March 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future.55Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The following table summarizes the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the periods shown:Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)20212020201920212020Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$4,542 $4,374 $4,036 $168 $338 Investing activities(415)(579)(1,381)164 802 Financing activities(1,693)(2,734)(2,227)1,041 (507)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(61)(19)(119)(42)100 Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$2,373 $1,042 $309 $1,331 $733 Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided from operating activities was $4.5 billion, $4.4 billion, and $4.0 billion for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements, and vendor payment terms. Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 were affected by net income adjusted for non-cash items, including the pre-tax $8.1 billion (after-tax $6.8 billion) non-cash charge related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims, an increase in inventory of $2.3 billion and an increase in drafts and accounts payable of $1.3 billion driven by higher inventory stock levels to meet increased volume demand as part of our inventory management, as well as a decrease in receivables of $1.1 billion driven by timing, higher sales recognized at the end of March 2020, and higher collections in our fourth quarter of 2021. Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2020 were affected by increases in drafts and accounts payable of $4.0 billion primarily associated with timing, replenishing inventory stocks, and effective working capital management, and an increase in receivables of $2.5 billion primarily due to revenue growth. Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2019 were affected by increases in drafts and accounts payable of $2.0 billion primarily due to increased inventory purchases and timing of payments, and an increase in receivables of $1.0 billion due to the overall increase in sales volume and timing of receipts. Other non-cash items within operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 primarily includes stock-based compensation of $151 million and fair value remeasurement charges of $58 million related to the contribution of our German pharmaceutical wholesale business to a joint venture with WBA. Other non-cash items for the year ended March 31, 2020 primarily includes fair value remeasurement charges of $275 million described above, pension settlement charges of $122 million, and stock-based compensation of $119 million. Additionally, we made a cash payment of $114 million from the executive benefit retirement plan in 2020. Other non-cash items for the year ended March 31, 2019 primarily includes stock-based compensation of $95 million.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $415 million, $579 million, and $1.4 billion for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 include $451 million and $190 million in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, respectively. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 also includes net cash proceeds of $400 million from sales of businesses and investments, including $286 million in exchange for the contribution of our German pharmaceutical wholesale business to a joint venture with WBA.Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2020 include $362 million and $144 million in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, respectively, and $133 million of net cash payments for acquisitions.Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2019 include $905 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $784 million for our acquisition of Medical Specialties Distributors LLC, $426 million and $131 million in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, respectively, and $101 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and investments. 56Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $1.7 billion, $2.7 billion, and $2.2 billion for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 include cash receipts of $6.3 billion and payments of $6.3 billion from short-term borrowings, primarily commercial paper, along with the issuance of the 2025 Notes in a principal amount of $500 million, the retirement of our $700 million total principal amount of notes due on November 30, 2020 at a fixed interest rate of 3.65% upon maturity, and the redemption of our 4.75% $323 million total principal of notes due on March 1, 2021 prior to maturity. The notes were redeemed using cash on hand and proceeds from the 2025 Notes. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 also include $770 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $276 million of dividends paid. Cash used for other financing activities generally includes payments to noncontrolling interests and activity from our finance leases. Other financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 also include restricted cash net inflow related to funds temporarily held on behalf of unaffiliated medical practice groups and a payment of $49 million to purchase shares of McKesson Europe through exercises of a put right option by noncontrolling shareholders.Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2020 include cash receipts of $21.4 billion and payments of $21.4 billion from short-term borrowings, primarily commercial paper. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2020 also include $2.0 billion of cash paid for stock repurchases, repayments of long-term debt of $298 million, and $294 million of dividends paid.Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2019 include cash receipts of $37.3 billion and payments of $37.3 billion from short-term borrowings, primarily commercial paper. We received cash from long-term debt issuances of $1.1 billion and made repayments on long-term debt of $1.1 billion in 2019. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2019 also include $1.6 billion of cash paid for stock repurchases and $292 million of dividends paid.Share Repurchase PlansThe Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by combinations of such methods, any of which may use pre-arranged trading plans that are designed to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations, and other market and economic conditions.Information regarding the share repurchase activity over the last three years is as follows:Share Repurchases (1)(In millions, except price per share data)Total Number ofShares Purchased (2) Average Price Paid Per ShareApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the ProgramsBalance, March 31, 2018$1,096 Shares repurchase plans authorized in May 20184,000 Shares repurchased - Open market10.4 $132.14 (1,377)Shares repurchased - ASR2.1 $117.98 (250)Balance, March 31, 20193,469 Shares repurchased - Open market9.2 $144.68 (1,334)Shares repurchased - ASR4.7 $127.68 (600)Balance, March 31, 20201,535 Shares repurchase plans authorized in January 20212,000 Shares repurchased - Open market (3)4.7 $160.33 (750)Balance, March 31, 2021$2,785 57Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)(1)This table does not include the value of equity awards surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations. It also excludes shares related to the Split-off of the Change Healthcare JV as described below. (2)The number of shares purchased reflects rounding adjustments.(3)$8 million was accrued within “Other accrued liabilities” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021 for share repurchases that were executed in late March and settled in early April.During the last three years, our share repurchases were transacted through both open market transactions and ASR programs with third party financial institutions.In 2019, we retired 5.0 million or $542 million of the Company’s treasury shares previously repurchased. Under the applicable state law, these shares resume the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. In accordance with our accounting policy, we allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. Accordingly, our retained earnings and additional paid-in capital were reduced by $472 million and $70 million during 2019, respectively.On March 9, 2020, we completed the Split-off of our interest in the Change Healthcare JV. In connection with the Split-off, we distributed all 176.0 million outstanding shares of SpinCo common stock, which held all of the Company’s interests in the Change Healthcare JV, to participating holders of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 15.4 million shares of McKesson stock, which are now held as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheet. Following consummation of the exchange offer, on March 10, 2020, SpinCo merged with and into Change and each share of SpinCo common stock was converted into one share of Change common stock, par value $0.001 per share, with cash being paid in lieu of fractional shares of Change common stock. See Note 2, “Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The total authorization outstanding for repurchase of the Company’s common stock was $2.8 billion at March 31, 2021.We believe that our future operating cash flow, financial assets, and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that an increase in volatility or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. As described within the “Trends and Uncertainties” section above, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop rapidly. We continue to monitor its impact on demand within parts of our business, as well as trends potentially impacting the timing or ability for some of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources:March 31, (Dollars in millions)202120202019Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$6,396 $4,023 $2,981 Working capital1,279 (402)839 Days sales outstanding for: (1)Customer receivables26 26 26 Inventories31 27 31 Drafts and accounts payable63 61 62 Debt to capital ratio (2)83.1 %52.1 %43.3 %Return on McKesson stockholders’ equity (deficit) (3)(142.5)%13.3 %0.4 %(1)Based on year-end balances and sales or cost of sales for the last 90 days of the year.(2)This ratio describes the relationship and changes within our capital resources, and is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity (deficit), which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA-rated U.S. government money market funds and overnight deposits with financial institutions. Deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollars. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 included approximately $2.3 billion and $1.7 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S., respectively. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the U.S. is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. Following enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the repatriation of cash to the U.S. is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, and other current liabilities. Our businesses require substantial investments in working capital that are susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to increase the variations in our working capital, which we continue to monitor closely.Consolidated working capital improved at March 31, 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and inventory, partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable and a decrease in receivables. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in drafts and accounts payable and the current portion of long-term debt for term notes due in 2021, partially offset by an increase in receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Our debt to capital ratio increased for the year ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ equity driven by net loss for the year and share repurchases. Our unfavorable return on McKesson’s stockholder’s equity (deficit) as of March 31, 2021 was also driven by net loss for the year. Net loss for the year ended March 31, 2021 includes an after-tax non-cash charge of $6.8 billion related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims, as discussed in “Trends and Uncertainties” of this Financial Review and Financial Note 19, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. Our debt to capital ratio increased for 2020 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ equity driven by the Split-off of our interest in Change Healthcare JV and share repurchases. On July 29, 2020, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.41 to $0.42 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. Dividends were $1.67 per share in 2021, $1.62 per share in 2020, and $1.51 per share in 2019. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, we paid total cash dividends of $276 million, $294 million, and $292 million, respectively. Additionally, as required under the Domination Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe.59Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Contractual Obligations: The table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2021:Years(In millions)TotalWithin 1Over 1 to 3Over 3 to 5After 5On balance sheetTotal debt (1)$7,148 $742 $1,970 $1,253 $3,183 Operating lease obligations (2) 2,505 433 733 516 823 Other (3) 250 30 53 51 116 Off balance sheetInterest on borrowings (4)1,617 199 367 268 783 Purchase obligations (5)7,354 7,268 76 10 — Other (6)472 268 59 26 119 Total$19,346 $8,940 $3,258 $2,124 $5,024 (1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations, including an immaterial amount of finance lease obligations.(2)Represents undiscounted minimum operating lease obligations under non-cancelable operating leases having an initial remaining term over one year and is not adjusted for imputed interest.

(6)Includes agreements under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory and our customers’ debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions.The contractual obligations table above excludes the following obligations:At March 31, 2021, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $738 million. Additionally, any future payments that may be made related to our estimated litigation liability of $8.1 billion for opioid-related claims, as described in the “Trends and Uncertainties” section in this Financial Review and Financial Note 19, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are excluded. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements related to these items cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.Our banks and insurance companies have issued $146 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at March 31, 2021. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations, and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.Our redeemable noncontrolling interests primarily relate to our consolidated subsidiary, McKesson Europe. Under the Domination Agreement, the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe have a right to put (“Put Right”) their shares at €22.99 per share, increased annually for interest in the amount of five percentage points above a base rate published semi-annually by the German Bundesbank, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid by McKesson (“Put Amount”). The exercise of the Put Right will reduce the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests. During 2021, we paid $49 million to purchase 1.8 million shares of McKesson Europe through exercises of the Put Right by the noncontrolling shareholders. During 2020 and 2019, there were no material exercises of the Put Right. 60Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. The carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests is also adjusted each period for the portion of other comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling shareholders, which is primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At March 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to McKesson Europe of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.2 billion. In future periods, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the Euro and the U.S. dollar could adversely impact the carrying value of our redeemable noncontrolling interests and require an adjustment to increase the balance of our redeemable noncontrolling interests to its maximum redemption value. Such adjustments would be recorded in “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in our consolidated statements of operations.Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (the “Compensation Amount”) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the Domination Agreement. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. The Domination Agreement does not expire, but it may be terminated at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least six month’s advance notice. The Put Amount, Compensation Amount, and the guaranteed dividend were subject to ongoing appraisal proceedings. On April 12, 2021, we received the Stuttgart Court of Appeals’ final ruling confirming the original put value of €22.99 per share and the annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share. The Put Right exercise window will expire on June 15, 2021. While the ultimate amount of any future cash payments related to exercises of the Put Right are uncertain, Put Right exercises could result in cash payments of up to approximately $1.3 billion prior to the expiration of the Put Right.Refer to Financial Note 9, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on redeemable noncontrolling interests.Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources, and other capital market transactions. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 13, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 2, “Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture,” and Financial Note 21, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $6.3 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. The effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2021 and 2020 of approximately $17 million and $6 million, respectively.61Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)Foreign exchange risk: We conduct our business worldwide in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in U.S. dollars. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies.We have certain foreign exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. The forward contracts and cross-currency swaps are intended to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign exchange risk.As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $267 million and $435 million, respectively. However, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Refer to Financial Note 16, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps.The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.62Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:11:59.625377

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part II, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 12, 2021.Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report for additional factors relating to these statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Overview of Our Business:We are a diversified healthcare services leader dedicated to advancing health outcomes for patients everywhere. Our teams partner with biopharma companies, care providers, pharmacies, manufacturers, governments, and others to deliver insights, products, and services to help make quality care more accessible and affordable.32Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We report our results in four reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical, Prescription Technology Solutions (“RxTS”), Medical-Surgical Solutions, and International. Our organizational structure also includes Corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects, and the results of certain investments. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit before interest expense and income taxes. The following summarizes our four reportable segments. Refer to Financial Note 21, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information regarding our reportable segments.•U.S. Pharmaceutical is a reportable segment that distributes branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare-related products. This segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate site) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services.•Prescription Technology Solutions is a reportable segment that combines automation and our ability to navigate the healthcare ecosystem to connect pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharma companies to address patients’ medication access, adherence, and affordability challenges to help people get the medicine they need to live healthier lives. •Medical-Surgical Solutions is a reportable segment that provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers in the United States (“U.S.”).•International is a reportable segment that includes our operations in Europe and Canada, bringing together non-U.S.-based drug distribution services, specialty pharmacy, retail, and infusion care services. During 2022, we entered into agreements to sell certain of our businesses in the European Union (“E.U.”) and our retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), as well as completed the sale of our Austrian business. These divestitures are further described in the “European Divestiture Activities” section below.European Divestiture ActivitiesOn July 5, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell certain of our businesses in the E.U. located in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia, along with our German headquarters and wound-care business, part of a shared services center in Lithuania, and our ownership stake in a joint venture in the Netherlands (“E.U. disposal group”) to the PHOENIX Group for a purchase price of €1.2 billion (or, approximately $1.4 billion) adjusted for certain items, including cash, net debt and working capital adjustments, and reduced by the value of the noncontrolling interest held by minority shareholders of McKesson Europe AG (“McKesson Europe”) at the transaction closing date. We recorded charges of $438 million for the year ended March 31, 2022 in total operating expenses to remeasure the E.U. disposal group to fair value less costs to sell and to impair certain internal-use software that will not be utilized in the future. The remeasurement adjustment includes a $151 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive income balances associated with the E.U. disposal group, driven by declines in the Euro. The transaction is anticipated to close within the second half of fiscal year 2023, pursuant to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.On November 1, 2021, we announced an agreement to sell our retail and distribution businesses in the U.K. (“U.K. disposal group”) to Aurelius Elephant Limited. In April 2022, we entered into an amendment to the agreement for a purchase price of £110 million (or, approximately $144 million), including certain adjustments. We recorded charges of $1.2 billion for the year ended March 31, 2022 in total operating expenses to remeasure the U.K. disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. The remeasurement adjustment includes a $734 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive income balances associated with the U.K. disposal group, driven by declines in the British pound sterling. The transaction closed on April 6, 2022, and at closing the buyer assumed and repaid a note payable to us of approximately $118 million.33Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)On January 31, 2022, we completed the sale of our Austrian business to Quadrifolia Management GmbH in a management-led buyout for a purchase price of €244 million (or, approximately $276 million), including certain adjustments. We divested net assets of the Austrian business of $272 million, primarily within the International segment, and the buyer assumed a note payable to us of approximately $63 million which was paid to us in the fourth quarter of 2022. We recorded a charge of $32 million for the year ended March 31, 2022 in total operating expenses to remeasure the Austrian business to fair value less costs to sell.On January 31, 2022, we sold our 30% interest in the German pharmaceutical wholesale joint venture to Walgreens Boots Alliance (“WBA”). We recognized a $42 million gain within “Other income, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended March 31, 2022 related to this sale.As of March 31, 2022, we had $4.5 billion of assets and $4.7 billion of liabilities classified as “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities held for sale,” respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet primarily related to the European divestiture activities described above. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Held for Sale,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.Executive Summary:The following summary provides highlights and key factors that impacted our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2022. •The pandemic disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) impacted our results of operations for the year ended March 31, 2022. As previously disclosed in our 2021 Annual Report, pharmaceutical distribution volumes decreased across the enterprise during the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the weakened and uncertain global economic environment and COVID-19 restrictions, including government-mandated business shutdowns and shelter-in-place orders, following the onset of the pandemic. The recovery from the pandemic is favorably reflected in our results when comparing 2022 versus 2021. We also had favorable contributions from our COVID-19 vaccine and related ancillary supply kit distribution programs during 2022;•In 2021, we began distributing certain COVID-19 vaccines under the direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”). Since 2021 and through the end of 2022, we distributed over 380 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to administration sites all across the U.S. and in support of the U.S. government’s international donation mission. For a more in-depth discussion of how COVID-19 impacted our business, operations, and outlook, refer to the COVID-19 section of ""Trends and Uncertainties"" included below;•Revenues of $264 billion, reflects an 11% increase from the prior year primarily driven by market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment;•Gross profit increased 8% from the prior year primarily driven by improvements in primary care patient visits and the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment as well as growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and the contribution from our COVID-19 vaccination distribution program in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment; •Total operating expenses in 2022 includes fair value remeasurement charges related to our “European Divestiture Activities” discussed above;•Other income, net in 2022 includes net gains of $98 million related to our McKesson Ventures equity investments and $42 million related to the gain on sale of our 30% interest in the German pharmaceutical wholesale joint venture with WBA;•On July 23, 2021, we completed a cash tender offer and paid an aggregate consideration of $1.1 billion to redeem certain notes with a principal amount of $922 million. As a result of the redemption, we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment in the second quarter of 2022 of $191 million, consisting of the premiums paid and a portion of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs in an amount proportional to the principal amount of debt retired. Refer to Financial Note 12, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information;•Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation in 2022 of $7.23 reflects the aforementioned items, net of any respective tax impacts, discrete tax items recognized, and a lower share count compared to the prior year due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases;34Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)•We paid $1.0 billion to purchase 34.5 million shares of McKesson Europe in 2022 through exercises of a put right by the noncontrolling shareholders pursuant to the December 2014 domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”); •On July 17, 2021, we redeemed our 0.63% Euro-denominated notes with a principal amount of €600 million (or, approximately $709 million) prior to the maturity date of August 17, 2021. The notes were redeemed using cash on hand. On August 12, 2021, we also completed a public offering of 1.30% notes due August 15, 2026 with a principal amount of $500 million for proceeds received, net of discounts and offering expenses, of $495 million. We utilized the net proceeds from this note for general corporate purposes;•We returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders through $3.5 billion of common stock repurchases and $277 million of dividend payments during 2022. On July 23, 2021, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.42 to $0.47 per common share; and•In December 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an increase of $4.0 billion for the authorized repurchases of our common stock.Trends and Uncertainties:The Impact of Inflationary and Global EventsOur business and results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity are impacted by broad economic conditions including inflation, increased competition for talent, and disruption of the supply chain, as well as by political or civil unrest or military action, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Cost inflation during 2022 generally affects us by increasing transportation, operational, and other administrative costs associated with our normal business operations which we might not be able to fully pass along to our customers. Although, it is difficult to predict the impact that these factors may have on our business in the future, they did not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2022.COVID-19 The SARS-CoV-2 novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, continues to evolve since it was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization. We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the ongoing impacts COVID-19 has on our business, operations, and financial results. The full extent to which COVID-19 will impact us depends on many factors and future developments, which are described in our “Risks and Forward-Looking Information” section below.Our Response to COVID-19 in the WorkplaceWe are committed to continuing to supply our customers and protect the safety of our employees. The various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations include telecommuting and work-from-home policies, restricted travel, employee support programs, and enhanced safety measures. During the first quarter of 2022, we approved changes to our real estate strategy to increase efficiencies and support flexibility for our employees, including a partial remote work model for certain employees as further discussed in this Financial Review and in Financial Note 3, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. During the third quarter of 2022, we continued to refine our policies and apply safety measures in the workplace as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) as COVID-19 cases increased across North America and Europe driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant.During 2022, we continued COVID-19 vaccination protocols for our U.S. and Canada employees, which are designed to be consistent with federal, state, and local laws and with customer requirements and to protect the safety of our employees, customers, patients, and communities while also safeguarding the healthcare supply chain. In Europe, we followed applicable government guidelines. We continue to monitor all of these changing laws, requirements and guidelines. We have not observed a material increase in employee turnover as a result of COVID-19 vaccination protocols; however, we are unable to predict whether such protocols will have a material impact on our workforce in the future.35Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Our Role in the Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines and Ancillary Supply KitsAs a diversified healthcare services leader, we remain well positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. We have worked and continue to work closely with national and local governments, agencies, and industry partners to ensure that available supplies, including PPE, and medicine reach our customers and patients. Through a contract with the CDC, we continue to support the U.S. government as a centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies needed to administer vaccines. We began distributing certain COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020. In the first quarter of 2022, McKesson began supporting the U.S. government’s commitment to donate COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. For this initiative, we are responsible for picking and packing the COVID-19 vaccines into temperature-controlled coolers and preparing them for pickup by an international partner. We do not manage the actual shipments of the vaccines to other countries. The results of operations related to our vaccine distribution are reflected in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. We also continue to manage the assembly, storage, and distribution of ancillary supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccines, including sourcing some of those supplies, through agreements with both the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and Pfizer, Inc. The results of operations for the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies are reflected in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. The future financial impact of the arrangements with the CDC and HHS depend on numerous uncertainties, which are described in our “Risks and Forward-Looking Information” section below.McKesson Canada and McKesson Europe are playing a role by supporting governments and public health entities through distributing COVID-19 vaccines and administering them in pharmacies. Additionally, McKesson Canada and McKesson Europe are distributing COVID-19 tests and certain PPE.Trends in our BusinessAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic late in our fourth quarter of 2020, we had higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes and increased retail pharmacy foot traffic as our customers increased supplies on hand in March. During 2021, pharmaceutical distribution volumes decreased as a result of the weakened and uncertain global economic environment and COVID-19 restrictions, including government-mandated business shutdowns and shelter-in-place orders. We also had a decrease in demand for primary care medical-surgical supplies due to deferrals in elective procedures in hospitals and surgery centers as well as decreased traffic and closures of doctors’ offices, which was partially offset by demand for PPE and COVID-19 tests. Additionally, the decreased traffic in doctors’ offices and general shelter-in-place guidance by governmental authorities negatively impacted retail pharmacy foot traffic in both Europe and Canada. This drove favorability in our results when comparing 2022 versus 2021, particularly during the first quarter.We have observed improvements in prescription volumes and primary care patient visits during 2022 compared to the prior year period; however, the recovery of COVID-19 continues to be non-linear and impacted by virus variants such as Omicron and ongoing fluctuations in case levels. During the year ended March 31, 2022, the U.S. distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and related ancillary kits favorably impacted our results. We recognized higher sales for COVID-19 tests primarily due to limited product availability in the first quarter of 2021 and increased demand during 2022 corresponding with the spike in positive COVID-19 cases as a result of the Delta and Omicron variants.36Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Impact to our Supply Chain We also continue to monitor and address the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on our supply chain. Although the availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers, their locations, and the extent to which they are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proactively working with manufacturers, industry partners, and government agencies to meet the needs of our customers during the pandemic. Overall, during 2022 we had an increase in supply chain costs primarily related to transportation and labor; however, this did not materially impact our results of operations for the year ended March 31, 2022. In our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, we have observed certain supply chain disruptions for COVID-19 tests, which poses a potential risk for supply availability to meet the future demand. As potential shortages or disruptions of any products are identified we address supply continuity, which includes securing additional products when available, sourcing back-up products when needed, and following allocation procedures to maintain and protect supply as much as possible. We utilize business continuity action planning to maintain and protect operations across all locations and facilities.Impact to our Results of Operations, Financial Condition, and LiquidityFor the year ended March 31, 2022, COVID-19 tests and the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment contributed approximately $1.8 billion, or 16% to segment revenues, and including total inventory charges as further described below, increased our segment operating profit by approximately $208 million, or 22%.The distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment contributed less than 10% to segment operating profit during the year ended March 31, 2022. The financial impact from our COVID-19 response efforts in the International segment during 2022 was not material to our consolidated results, but contributed to year over year favorability in segment operating results. During the year ended March 31, 2021, particularly during the first quarter, we had lower pharmaceutical volumes, specialty drug volumes, and patient care visits that negatively impacted our consolidated revenues and income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes. The recovery of prescription volume trends and patient care visits, which are also described in more detail above in the “Trends in our Business” section, had a favorable impact year over year across our businesses when comparing 2022 versus 2021.Additionally, certain PPE items held for resale were valued in our inventory at costs that were inflated by earlier COVID-19 pandemic demand levels. That inventory valuation, if not supported by market resale prices, may be written down to net realizable value. We may also write-off inventory due to decreased customer demand and excess inventory. During the year ended March 31, 2022, we recorded inventory charges totaling $164 million on certain PPE and other related products in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. Of this amount, we recorded $147 million in cost of sales driven by the intent of management not to sell certain excess PPE inventory, which required an inventory write-down to zero, and instead direct it to charitable organizations or otherwise dispose. We recorded $8 million in total operating expenses for excess inventory which had already been committed for donation at the time of the charge and subsequently was delivered during 2022. In addition, $9 million of inventory charges were recorded in cost of sales for PPE and other related products that management intends to sell. Although market price volatility and changes to anticipated customer demand may require additional write-downs in future periods of other PPE and related product categories, we are taking measures to mitigate such risk.Overall, these COVID-19 related items had a net favorable impact on consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period. Impacts to future periods due to COVID-19 may differ based on future developments, which is described in our “Risks and Forward-Looking Information” section below.During the year ended March 31, 2022, we maintained appropriate labor and overall vendor supply levels and experienced no material impacts to our liquidity or net working capital due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and engage with manufacturers, industry partners, and government agencies to anticipate shortages and respond to demand for certain medications and therapies. We are monitoring our customers closely for changes to their timing of payments or ability to pay amounts owed to us as a result of COVID-19 pandemic impacts to their businesses. We remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our revolving credit facility. Long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, have remained open and accessible to us during the COVID-19 pandemic. At March 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future.37Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Risks and Forward-Looking InformationThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and exacerbated uncertainties inherent in estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in our forecasts. We still face numerous uncertainties in estimating the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on our future business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. The full extent to which COVID-19 will impact us depends on many factors and future developments, including: the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic; potential seasonality of viral outbreaks; impacts of additional variants of the SARS-Cov-2 virus; the amount of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supply kits that we are contracted to distribute; the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and governmental measures designed to mitigate the spread of the virus; the effectiveness of treatments of infected individuals; commercialization of COVID-19 vaccines; competition in COVID-19 vaccine distribution; and changes or disruptions in product supply. We have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in pricing due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains. Due to several rapidly changing variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic, estimations of future economic trends and the timing of when COVID-19 may no longer significantly impact our ability to forecast future financial performance remain challenging. Additionally, we periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Key assumptions and estimates about future values in our impairment assessments can be affected by a variety of factors, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on industry and economic trends as well as on our business strategy and internal forecasts. Material changes to key assumptions and estimates can decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and have resulted in impairment charges of certain long-lived assets and could potentially result in future impairment charges. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report for a disclosure of risk factors related to COVID-19.Opioid-Related Litigation and ClaimsWe are a defendant in many legal proceedings asserting claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids) in federal and state courts throughout the U.S., and in Puerto Rico and Canada. The plaintiffs in these actions have included state attorneys general, county and municipal governments, tribal nations, hospitals, health and welfare funds, third-party payors, and individuals. On February 25, 2022, the Company and two other United States pharmaceutical distribution companies (collectively, ""Distributors"") determined that there is sufficient State and subdivision participation to proceed with an agreement (""Settlement"") to settle a substantial majority of opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Distributors by U.S. states, territories and local governmental entities. Under the Settlement, 46 of 49 eligible states and their participating subdivisions, as well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories (collectively, ""Settling Governmental Entities""), have agreed to join the Settlement. The Settlement became effective on April 2, 2022. If all conditions to the Settlement are satisfied, including the receipt of approval by relevant courts of consent decrees to dismiss the lawsuits, the Distributors would pay the Settling Governmental Entities up to approximately $19.5 billion over 18 years, with up to approximately $7.4 billion to be paid by the Company for its 38.1% portion. Under the Settlement, a minimum of 85% of the settlement payments must be used by state and local governmental entities to remediate the opioid epidemic. Most of the remaining percentage relates to plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs, and would be payable over a shorter time period. Under the Settlement, the Distributors will establish a clearinghouse to consolidate their controlled-substance distribution data, which will be available to the settling U.S. states to use as part of their anti-diversion efforts. The Settlement provides that the Distributors do not admit liability or wrongdoing and do not waive any defenses.The Settlement only addresses the claims of attorneys general of U.S. states and territories and political subdivisions in participating states and territories. The terms under which the Distributors previously agreed to settle opioids claims of the states of New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Florida and Texas, and each of their participating subdivisions, will become part of the Settlement. The previously disclosed agreement for the Distributors to settle opioids claims of the attorney general of West Virginia will remain a separate settlement arrangement that is not part of the Settlement. Governmental entities not participating in the Settlement may continue to pursue their claims. The states of Alabama, Oklahoma and Washington chose not to participate in the Settlement. We have reached separate agreements in principle with the attorneys general of Alabama and Washington to settle the claims of those states and their subdivisions. The Distributors previously settled with the Cherokee Nation and reached a separate agreement in principle to settle the claims of the remaining federally recognized Native American Tribes.38Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We recorded a charge of $8.1 billion during the year ended March 31, 2021 related to our estimated liability to U.S. governmental entities, including those expected to participate in the Settlement, the states and subdivisions that were not expected to participate or were not eligible, and the Native American tribes. In connection with the Settlement and other opioid-related settlement accruals described above, we recorded additional charges of $274 million during the year ended March 31, 2022 within “Claims and litigation charges, net” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our total estimated liability for opioid-related claims was $8.3 billion as of March 31, 2022, of which $1.0 billion was included in “Other accrued liabilities” for the amount estimated to be paid prior to March 31, 2023, and the remaining liability was included in “Long-term litigation liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Although the vast majority of opioid claims have been brought by governmental entities in the U.S., the Company is also a defendant in cases brought in the U.S. by private plaintiffs, such as hospitals, health and welfare funds, third-party payors, and individuals, as well as four cases brought in Canada (three by governmental or tribal entities and one by an individual). These claims, and those of private entities generally, are not included in the Settlement or in the charges recorded by the Company, described above. The Company believes it has valid legal defenses in these matters and intends to mount a vigorous defense. Because of the many uncertainties associated with ongoing opioid-related litigation matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters. In light of the uncertainty, the amount of any ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued. Notwithstanding the Settlement, we also continue to prepare for trial in pending matters. We believe that we have valid defenses to the claims pending against us and, absent an acceptable settlement, intend to vigorously defend against all such claims. An adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations.

Market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases, and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with branded to generic drug conversion. Gross ProfitGross profit increased for the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment driven by improvements in patient care visits in our primary care business, the contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from PPE and other related products largely due to inventory charges. Gross profit was favorably impacted by growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and the contribution from our vaccine distribution programs in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Gross profit was also driven by increased volume with new and existing customers in our RxTS segment.Gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, included LIFO inventory credits of $23 million and $38 million, respectively. The lower LIFO credits in 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily due to higher brand inflation and delays of branded off-patent to generic drug launches. Refer to the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section included in this Financial Review for further information. Gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 also included net cash proceeds received of $46 million and $181 million, respectively, representing our share of antitrust legal settlements.Total Operating ExpensesA summary and description of the components of our total operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:•Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses (“SDG&A”): SDG&A consists of personnel costs, transportation costs, depreciation and amortization, lease costs, professional fee expenses, administrative expenses, remeasurement charges to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, and other general charges.•Claims and litigation charges, net: These charges include adjustments for estimated probable settlements related to our controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. Legal fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred, are included within SDG&A.•Goodwill impairments charges: We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the third quarter and more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. The resulting goodwill impairment charges are reflected within this line item. •Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net: Restructuring charges that are incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted as well as long-lived asset impairments.

Total operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 were affected by the following significant items:2022•SDG&A includes charges totaling $1.2 billion to remeasure our U.K. disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. The remeasurement adjustment includes a $734 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive income balances associated with the U.K. disposal group, driven by declines in the British pound sterling. Of the total charges recorded during the period, $1.1 billion are included within our International segment and $42 million are included within Corporate expenses, net;•SDG&A includes charges of $438 million to remeasure assets and liabilities of our E.U. disposal group held for sale to fair value less costs to sell and to impair certain internal-use software that will not be utilized in the future. The remeasurement adjustment includes a $151 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive income balances associated with the E.U. disposal group, driven by declines in the Euro. Of the total charges recorded during the period, $383 million are included within our International segment and $55 million are included within Corporate expenses, net;•SDG&A reflects a cost reduction of $142 million related to the cessation of depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and operating lease right-of-use assets classified as held for sale for our European divestiture disposal groups;•SDG&A includes opioid-related costs of $130 million primarily related to litigation expenses;•SDG&A includes a gain of $59 million related to the sale of our Canadian health benefit claims management and plan administrative services business;•SDG&A when compared to the same prior year period also includes increased employee-related and transportation costs across our businesses, partially offset by lower operating expenses due to the contribution of a majority of our German pharmaceutical business to a joint venture with WBA in the third quarter of 2021;•Claims and litigation charges, net includes a charge of $274 million related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims as previously discussed in the “Trends and Uncertainties” section;•Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net includes charges related to Corporate expenses, net, as well as our International segment. Refer to the “Restructuring Initiatives and Long-Lived Asset Impairments” and “Segment Operating Profit (Loss) and Corporate Expenses, Net” sections below as well as Financial Note 3, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information; and•Total operating expenses were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations.2021•SDG&A includes opioid-related costs of $153 million, primarily related to litigation expenses;•SDG&A reflects cost savings of $95 million on travel and entertainment due to travel and meeting restrictions associated with COVID-19;•SDG&A reflects charges of $58 million to remeasure assets and liabilities held for sale to fair value less costs to sell related to the completed contribution of the majority of our German pharmaceutical wholesale business to create a joint venture with WBA in which we held a 30% ownership interest within our International segment. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Held for Sale,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information;•SDG&A includes a charge of $50 million related to our estimated liability under the State of New York Opioid Stewardship Act (“OSA”);•SDG&A also includes lower operating expenses due to the contribution of our German pharmaceutical wholesale business to a joint venture with WBA and a divestiture in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment that closed in 2020; 42Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)•Claims and litigation charges, net includes a charge of $8.1 billion related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims;•Claims and litigation charges, net includes a net gain of $131 million reflecting insurance proceeds received, net of attorneys' fees and expenses awarded to plaintiffs' counsel, in connection with the previously reported $175 million settlement of the shareholder derivative action related to our controlled substances monitoring program;•Goodwill impairment charges of $69 million were recorded in connection with our segment realignment that commenced in the second quarter of 2021. Refer to the “Goodwill Impairment” section below for further details;•Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net includes long-lived asset impairment charges of $115 million primarily related to our retail pharmacy businesses in Canada and Europe within our International segment, and the remaining $219 million primarily represents costs associated with our operating model and cost optimization efforts in our corporate headquarters and International segment. In addition, certain charges related to restructuring initiatives are included under the caption “Cost of sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and were not material for the year ended March 31, 2021; and•Total operating expenses were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations.Goodwill ImpairmentsAs discussed in the “Overview of Our Business” section, our operating structure was realigned commencing in the second quarter of 2021 into four reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical, RxTS, Medical-Surgical Solutions, and International. These reportable segments encompass all operating segments of the Company. The segment realignment resulted in changes in multiple reporting units across the Company. As a result, we were required to perform a goodwill impairment test for these reporting units and recorded a goodwill impairment charge in our Europe Retail Pharmacy reporting unit of $69 million during the second quarter of 2021. At March 31, 2022, the balance of goodwill for our reporting units in Europe was approximately nil and the remaining balance of goodwill in the International segment primarily relates to one of our reporting units in Canada. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, and at an interim date, if indicators of potential impairment exist. The annual impairment testing performed in 2022 and 2021 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. However, other risks, expenses, and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods, including our McKesson Canada reporting unit within our International segment, where the risk of material goodwill impairment is higher than other reporting units. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in this Financial Review for further information.Restructuring Initiatives and Long-Lived Asset Impairments During the first quarter of 2022, we approved an initiative to increase operational efficiencies and flexibility by transitioning to a partial remote work model for certain employees. This initiative primarily included the rationalization of our office space in North America. Where we ceased using office space, we exited the portion of the facility no longer used. We also retained and repurposed certain other office locations. We recorded charges of $124 million for the year ended March 31, 2022 primarily related to lease right-of-use and other long-lived asset impairments, lease exit costs, and accelerated depreciation and amortization. This initiative was substantially complete in 2022 after which immaterial charges will continue to be incurred through the termination date of certain leases.During the first quarter of 2021, we committed to an initiative within the U.K., which is included in our International segment, to further drive transformational changes in technologies and business processes, operational efficiencies, and cost savings. The initiative included reducing the number of retail pharmacy stores, decommissioning obsolete technologies and processes, reorganizing and consolidating certain business operations, and related headcount reductions. Charges incurred for this initiative were not material for 2022, and were $57 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, primarily related to asset impairments and accelerated depreciation expense as well as employee severance and other employee-related costs. This initiative was substantially complete in 2022 and remaining costs we expect to record under this initiative are not material.43Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)In 2022, we recognized charges totaling $36 million to impair certain long-lived assets within our International segment related to our operations in Denmark and our retail pharmacy businesses in Canada. Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net for the year ended 2021 includes long-lived asset impairment charges of $115 million primarily related to our retail pharmacy businesses in Canada and Europe within our International segment. Refer to Financial Note 3 , “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.Other Income, Net Other income, net for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 includes net gains recognized from our equity investments of $98 million and $133 million, respectively. This primarily reflects mark-to-market gains on our investments in certain U.S. growth stage companies in the healthcare industry and realized gains on the exit of some of these investments as further described in Financial Note 16, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In future periods, fair value adjustments recognized in our operating results for these types of investments may be adversely impacted by market volatility. Other income, net for the year ended March 31, 2022 also includes a gain of $42 million related to the sale of our 30% interest in the German pharmaceutical wholesale joint venture with WBA.Loss on Debt ExtinguishmentThe loss on debt extinguishment recorded for the year ended March 31, 2022 of $191 million includes premiums of $182 million as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and transaction fees incurred of $9 million, and was driven by our July 2021 tender offer to redeem a portion of our existing debt. Refer to Financial Note 12, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.Interest ExpenseInterest expense decreased in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to the repayment of $1.0 billion of long-term debt in the third quarter of 2021 and our tender offer activity in the second quarter of 2022. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.Income Tax (Benefit) ExpenseWe recorded income tax (benefit) expense of $636 million and ($695 million) for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our reported income tax (benefit) expense rates were 33.0% and (13.8%) in 2022 and 2021, respectively.Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to non-cash charges related to remeasuring the value of certain of our European businesses to fair value less costs to sell, the impact of opioid-related claims, and changes in our mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions. Refer to Financial Note 7, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information. Our reported income tax rate for 2021 was impacted by the charge for opioid-related claims of $8.1 billion ($6.8 billion after-tax). Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $5 million and $1 million and for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.44Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP, Vantage Oncology Holdings, LLC, and the accrual of the annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe AG (“McKesson Europe”) share that McKesson is obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the Domination Agreement. Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of McKesson Corporation stockholders’ deficit in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to the “Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review and Financial Note 8, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on changes to our redeemable and noncontrolling interests that occurred during the first quarter of 2022.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to McKesson Corporation Net income (loss) attributable to McKesson Corporation was $1.1 billion and $(4.5) billion for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation was $7.23 and $(28.26) for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net loss per diluted share for the year ended March 31, 2021 is calculated by excluding dilutive securities from the denominator due to their antidilutive effects. Additionally, our 2022 and 2021 diluted earnings (loss) per share reflect the cumulative effects of share repurchases. Weighted-Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding Diluted earnings (loss) per common share was calculated based on a weighted-average number of shares outstanding of 154.1 million and 160.6 million for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding is impacted by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and the cumulative effect of share repurchases.45Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Overview of Segment Results: Segment Revenues: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions)20222021ChangeSegment revenuesU.S. Pharmaceutical$212,149 $189,274 12 %Prescription Technology Solutions3,864 2,890 34 Medical-Surgical Solutions11,608 10,099 15 International36,345 35,965 1 Total revenues$263,966 $238,228 11 %The changes in revenues for each of our segments for the year ended March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year consisted of the following:(Dollars in millions)Increase (decrease)Sales to pharmacies and institutional healthcare providers$20,577 Sales to specialty practices and other (1)2,298 Total change in U.S. Pharmaceutical revenues$22,875 Total change in Prescription Technology Solutions revenues$974 Sales to primary care customers$1,300 Sales to extended care customers(138)Other (2) 347 Total change in Medical-Surgical Solutions revenues$1,509 Sales in Europe, excluding FX impact$(2,159)Sales in Canada, excluding FX impact1,560 Impact from FX979 Total change in International revenues$380 Total change in revenues$25,738 FX - foreign currency exchange fluctuations.

Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report for a risk factor related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency exchange fluctuations,” which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of our operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In computing the foreign currency exchange fluctuations, we translate our current year results of our operations in foreign countries recorded in local currencies into U.S. dollars by applying their respective average foreign currency exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods reported in U.S. dollars.In July 2021, we announced our intention to exit our businesses in Europe. In 2022, we entered into agreements to sell the E.U. disposal group and U.K. disposal group and completed the previously announced sale of our Austrian business. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Held for Sale,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information on these European divestitures.Additional information regarding our foreign operations is also included in Financial Note 21, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.BUSINESS COMBINATIONSRefer to Financial Note 4, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.FISCAL 2023 OUTLOOKInformation regarding the Company’s fiscal 2023 outlook is contained in the release of our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 financial results included as an exhibit to our Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on May 5, 2022, which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. That Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in the ""Trends and Uncertainties"" section of this Financial Review, as well as the cautionary statements in Item 1, ""Business - Forward-Looking Statements,"" and Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" in Part I of this Annual Report.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters based upon past experience and management’s judgment that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.Allowances for Credit Losses: Our receivables primarily consist of short-term trade accounts receivable from customers that result from the sale of goods and services. We also provide other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.50Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The Company considers historical experience, the current economic environment, customer credit ratings or bankruptcies, legal disputes, and reasonable and supportable forecasts to develop its allowance for credit losses. Management reviews these factors quarterly to determine if any adjustments are needed to the allowance. Sales to the Company’s ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), accounted for approximately 52% of total consolidated revenues in 2022 and comprised approximately 43% of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2022. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 21% of our total consolidated revenues in 2022 and comprised approximately 28% of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2022. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business, and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2022 are appropriate and consistent in the context of historical methodologies employed, as well as assessment of trends currently available.At March 31, 2022, trade and notes receivables were $16.8 billion prior to allowances of $99 million. In 2022, 2021 and, 2020, our provision for bad debts was $29 million, $4 million, and $91 million, respectively. At March 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 0.6% and 1.2%, respectively. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2022 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $17 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst-case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowances for credit losses may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report.Inventories: Inventories consist of merchandise held for resale. We report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the LIFO method which are valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. LIFO method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under LIFO approximates market. The majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and weighted-average purchase prices. Rebates, cash discounts, and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. In determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.At March 31, 2022 and 2021, total inventories, net were $18.7 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 63% and 58% of our inventories at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately $383 million and $406 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We recognized LIFO credits of $23 million, $38 million, and $252 million in 2022, 2021 and, 2020, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The lower LIFO credits in 2022 compared to 2021 are primarily due to higher brand inflation and delays of branded off-patent to generic drug launches. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. 51Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We believe that the moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. As of March 31, 2022 and 2021, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. Business Combinations: We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that we obtain control of the acquired business. Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use a method that is a form or variation of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset are discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life. Refer to Financial Note 4, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets:GoodwillAs a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9.5 billion of goodwill at March 31, 2022 and 2021, and $2.1 billion and $2.9 billion of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the third quarter and more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.We apply the goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded equal to the amount of excess carrying value above the estimated fair value, if any, but not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the reasonableness of our concluded fair values.52Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rates or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry, or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. Under the market approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit. Under the income approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the determination of discount rates. The discount rates represent the weighted-average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing, which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital structure. Included in the estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections. An increase in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate.The annual impairment testing performed for 2022, 2021, and 2020 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. The segment change in the second quarter of 2021 prompted changes in multiple reporting units across the Company and as a result, goodwill included in impacted reporting units was reallocated using a relative fair value approach and assessed for impairment both before and after the reallocation. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $69 million in 2021 as the estimated fair value of the Europe Retail Pharmacy reporting unit was lower than its reassigned carrying value based on changes in the composition of the Europe Retail Pharmacy reporting unit within the International segment. At March 31, 2022 and 2021, the balance of goodwill in the International segment primarily relates to our McKesson Canada reporting unit. The estimated fair value of our McKesson Canada reporting unit in our International segment exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by 22% in 2022. The goodwill balance of this reporting unit was $1.5 billion at March 31, 2022, or approximately 16% of the consolidated goodwill balance. Generally, a decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of approximately 22% for McKesson Canada or an increase in the discount rate in excess of approximately 2% could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit in future reporting periods under the income approach. Other risks, expenses, and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions may require us to further revise the projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods. Refer to Financial Note 11, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.Long-Lived AssetsCurrently, all of our intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 24 years. We review intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of intangible and other long-lived assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our long-lived asset impairments.53Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are not depreciated or amortized. Fair value is determined based on the total consideration expected to be received by the Company. The fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group. When the net realizable value of a disposal group increases during a period, a gain can be recognized to the extent that it does not increase the value of the disposal group beyond its original carrying value when the disposal group was reclassified as held for sale. Valuation of Equity Method Investments: We evaluate our investments for other-than-temporary impairments when circumstances indicate those assets may be impaired. When the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the investment. We consider various factors in determining whether a loss in value of an investment is other than temporary including: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, the financial condition of the investees, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of value. Management makes certain judgments and estimates in its assessment including but not limited to: identifying if circumstances indicate a decline in value is other than temporary, expectations about the business operations of investees, as well as industry, financial, and market factors. Any significant changes in assumptions or judgments in assessing impairments could result in an impairment charge.Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties, including those used to conclude on the tax-free nature of the separation of the Change Healthcare JV and the unrecognized tax position related to opioid-related litigation and claims, and may differ from the actual amounts of tax benefit recognized. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations.We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided.54Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on future negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system, and other interested parties. In conjunction with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party. On February 25, 2022, the Company and two other U.S. pharmaceutical distribution companies (collectively, “Distributors”) determined that there is sufficient state and subdivision participation to proceed with an agreement to settle a substantial majority of opioid-related lawsuits filed against the Distributors by U.S. states, territories, and local governmental entities. Based on our estimated liability under the Settlement and to governmental entities not expected to participate in the settlement, we recorded a charge of $8.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2021 within “Claims and litigation charges, net” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations included in this Annual Report. In connection with the Settlement and other opioid-related settlement accruals, we recorded additional charges of $274 million during the year ended March 31, 2022 within “Claims and litigation charges, net,” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Because of the many uncertainties associated with the remaining opioid-related litigation matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters. While we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, or liquidity. Refer to Financial Note 18, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper program, will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term capital expenditures, working capital, and other cash requirements. We remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. At March 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future.55Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The following table summarizes the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the periods shown:Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions)20222021ChangeNet cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$4,434 $4,542 $(108)Investing activities(89)(415)326 Financing activities(6,321)(1,693)(4,628)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash55 (61)116 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash classified within Assets held for sale (1)(540)— (540)Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$(2,461)$2,373 $(4,834)(1)Refer to Financial Note 2, “Held for Sale,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided from operating activities was $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers, inventory receipts, and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements, and vendor payment terms. Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 were affected by net income adjusted for non-cash items, including the losses on our European businesses held for sale and our classifications of receivables, drafts and accounts payables, and inventories as held for sale. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Held for Sale,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information. Excluding the aforementioned classifications, operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 were affected by increases in inventory of $1.2 billion and drafts and accounts payable of $2.8 billion due to timing of purchases, and an increase in receivables of $1.8 billion resulting from timing of collections and higher revenues. Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 were affected by net income adjusted for non-cash items, including the pre-tax $8.1 billion (after-tax $6.8 billion) non-cash charge related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims, an increase in inventory of $2.3 billion and an increase in drafts and accounts payable of $1.3 billion driven by higher inventory stock levels to meet increased volume demand as part of our inventory management, as well as a decrease in receivables of $1.1 billion driven by timing, higher sales recognized at the end of March 2020, and higher collections in our fourth quarter of 2021.Other non-cash items within operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes an adjustment to net income of $191 million related to loss on debt extinguishment, non-cash inventory charges totaling $164 million on certain PPE and other related products in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, and stock-based compensation of $161 million. Other non-cash items for the year ended March 31, 2021 primarily includes stock-based compensation of $151 million and fair value remeasurement charges of $58 million related to the contribution of our German pharmaceutical wholesale business to a joint venture with WBA.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $89 million and $415 million for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 include $388 million and $147 million in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, respectively. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 also includes net cash proceeds of $578 million from sales of businesses and investments, primarily driven by our European divestiture activities described above including the disposal of our Austria business, and the sale of certain of our equity investments. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 include $451 million and $190 million in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, respectively. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 also includes net cash proceeds of $400 million from sales of businesses and investments, including $286 million in exchange for the contribution of our German pharmaceutical wholesale business to a joint venture with WBA.56Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $6.3 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 include cash receipts of $11.2 billion and payments of $11.2 billion for short-term borrowings of commercial paper. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 include a cash tender offer of $1.1 billion to redeem certain notes with a principal amount of $922 million and the redemption of our 0.63% Euro-denominated notes with a principal amount of €600 million (or, approximately $709 million) prior to the maturity date of August 17, 2021 using cash on hand. This resulted in total repayments of long-term debt during the year ended March 31, 2022 of $1.8 billion, including $184 million of cash paid for premiums and transaction fees. This was partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in August 2021 from a public offering of 1.30% notes due August 15, 2026 for proceeds received of $498 million, which was utilized for general corporate purposes. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 also include $3.5 billion of cash paid for share repurchases and $277 million of cash paid for dividends. Additionally, financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 include payments of $1.0 billion to purchase shares of McKesson Europe through exercises of a put right option by noncontrolling shareholders. Cash used for other financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes payments to noncontrolling interests, and funds temporarily held on behalf of unaffiliated medical practice groups.Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 include cash receipts of $6.3 billion and payments of $6.3 billion from short-term borrowings of commercial paper, along with the issuance of the 2025 Notes in a principal amount of $500 million, the retirement of our $700 million total principal amount of notes due on November 30, 2020 at a fixed interest rate of 3.65% upon maturity, and the redemption of our 4.75% $323 million total principal of notes due on March 1, 2021 prior to maturity. The notes were redeemed using cash on hand and proceeds from the 2025 Notes. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 also include $742 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $276 million of dividends paid. Cash used for other financing activities generally includes payments to noncontrolling interests and activity from our finance leases. Other financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 also include restricted cash net inflow related to funds temporarily held on behalf of unaffiliated medical practice groups.Share Repurchase PlansThe Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by combinations of such methods, any of which may use pre-arranged trading plans that are designed to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations, and other market and economic conditions. During the last two years, our share repurchases were transacted through both open market transactions and ASR programs with third-party financial institutions.Information regarding the share repurchase activity over the last two years is as follows:Share Repurchases (1)(In millions, except price per share data)Total Number ofShares Purchased (2) Average Price Paid Per ShareApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the ProgramsBalance, March 31, 2020$1,535 Shares repurchase authorization increase in 20212,000 Shares repurchased - Open market (3)4.7 $160.33 (750)Balance, March 31, 20212,785 Shares repurchased - May 2021 ASR5.2 $193.22 (1,000)Shares repurchased - Open market4.6 $217.73 (1,007)Shares repurchase authorization increase in 20224,000 Shares repurchased - February 2022 ASR (4)4.8 $265.56 (1,500)Balance, March 31, 2022$3,278 57Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)(1)This table does not include the value of equity awards surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations or forfeitures of equity awards.(2)The number of shares purchased reflects rounding adjustments.(3)Of the total dollar value, $8 million was accrued within “Other accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021 for share repurchases that were executed in late March and settled in early April.(4)In February 2022, the Company entered into an ASR program with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of the Company’s common stock. The average price paid per share and total number of shares purchased under this program are estimates based on the initial share purchase price and initial delivery of shares under an ASR agreement and may differ from the average price paid per share and total number of shares purchased under the ASR program upon its final settlement in May 2022.We believe that our future operating cash flow, financial assets, and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that an increase in volatility or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital ResourcesMarch 31, (Dollars in millions)20222021Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$3,935 $6,396 Working capital(2,235)1,279 Days sales outstanding for: (1)Customer receivables22 26 Inventories27 31 Drafts and accounts payable55 63 Debt to capital ratio (2)114.5 %83.1 %(1)Based on year-end balances and sales or cost of sales for the last 90 days of the year.(2)This ratio describes the relationship and changes within our capital resources, and is computed as the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt divided by the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, long-term debt, and McKesson stockholders’ equity (deficit), which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive loss.Cash equivalents, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA-rated U.S. government money market funds and overnight deposits with financial institutions. Deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollars. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2022 and 2021 included approximately $1.5 billion and $2.3 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S., respectively. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the U.S. is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. Following enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the repatriation of cash to the U.S. is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, and other accrued liabilities. Our businesses require substantial investments in working capital that are susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements.58Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and receivables, as well as an increase in other accrued liabilities and an increase in our current portion of debt, partially offset by a decrease in drafts and accounts payable, and an increase in net current assets held for sale related to our E.U. disposal group and U.K. disposal group. Consolidated working capital improved at March 31, 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and inventory, partially offset by an increase in drafts and accounts payable and a decrease in receivables.Our debt to capital ratio increased for the year ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in McKesson stockholders’ deficit driven by share repurchases, partially offset by net income for the year to date period. Our debt to capital ratio was also impacted by a decrease in total debt from the completion of a cash tender offer to redeem certain notes with a principal amount of $922 million and the redemption of our €600 million Euro-denominated notes both in July 2021, partially offset by the issuance of notes with a principal amount of $500 million in August 2021. Our debt to capital ratio increased for 2021 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ equity driven by net loss for the year and share repurchases.On July 23, 2021, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.42 to $0.47 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. Dividends were $1.83 per share in 2022 and $1.67 per share in 2021. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. In 2022 and 2021, we paid total cash dividends of $277 million and $276 million, respectively.Our redeemable noncontrolling interests primarily related to our consolidated subsidiary, McKesson Europe. At March 31, 2021, the carrying value was $1.3 billion and we owned approximately 78% of McKesson Europe’s outstanding common shares. Under the Domination Agreement, the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe had a right to put (“Put Right”) their shares at €22.99 per share, increased annually for interest in the amount of five percentage points above a base rate published semi-annually by the German Bundesbank, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid by McKesson (“Put Amount”). During 2022 and 2021, we paid $1.0 billion and $49 million, respectively, to purchase 34.5 million and 1.8 million shares, respectively, of McKesson Europe through exercises of the Put Right by the noncontrolling shareholders, which reduced the balance of our redeemable noncontrolling interests.The Put Right expired on June 15, 2021, at which point the remaining shares owned by the minority shareholders, valued at $287 million, were transferred from redeemable noncontrolling interests to noncontrolling interests. At March 31, 2022, we owned approximately 95% of McKesson Europe’s outstanding common shares. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (the “Compensation Amount”) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the Domination Agreement. The Compensation Amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period in “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Domination Agreement does not expire, but it may be terminated at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least six months’ advance notice. Our noncontrolling interest in McKesson Europe will be included in the sale of our E.U. disposal group, as discussed in more detail in Financial Note 2, “Held for Sale,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Refer to Financial Note 8, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests.59Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Material Cash Requirements: The table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments as of March 31, 2022:Years(In millions)TotalWithin 1Over 1 to 3Over 3 to 5After 5On balance sheetTotal debt (1)$5,879 $799 $1,001 $2,400 $1,679 Operating lease obligations (2) 1,815 328 578 403 506 Other (3) 144 19 29 30 66 Off balance sheetInterest on borrowings (4)1,085 164 252 199 470 Purchase obligations (5)6,294 6,195 99 — — Other (6)451 309 51 27 64 Total$15,668 $7,814 $2,010 $3,059 $2,785 (1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations, including an immaterial amount of finance lease obligations.(2)Represents undiscounted minimum operating lease obligations under non-cancelable operating leases having an initial remaining term over one year and is not adjusted for imputed interest.

The majority of this amount relates to a global settlement payable in annual installments for up to 18 years pursuant to the schedule set forth in the agreement. We expect to pay $1.0 billion prior to March 31, 2023.At March 31, 2022, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $1.0 billion. The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.Our banks and insurance companies have issued $214 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at March 31, 2022. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations, pension obligations in Europe, and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.60Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our commercial paper issuances. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements, including any future payments that may be made related to our total estimated litigation liability of $8.3 billion as of March 31, 2022 for opioid-related claims, are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources, and other capital market transactions. Long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, are open and accessible to us should we decide to access those markets. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 12, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 4, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” and Financial Note 20, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.Interest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $3.5 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. The effect of a hypothetical 50 basis points increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings, would not have resulted in a material impact to earnings in 2022 or 2021.Foreign currency exchange rate risk: We conduct our business worldwide in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Euro, British pound sterling, and Canadian dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in U.S. dollars. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies.We have certain foreign currency exchange rate risk programs that use foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps. The forward contracts and cross-currency swaps are intended to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency exchange rate risk.As of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $122 million and $267 million, respectively. However, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Refer to Financial Note 15, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps.61Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONIn July 2021, we announced our intention to exit our businesses in Europe. During 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell certain of our businesses in the European Union which is anticipated to close within the second half of fiscal year 2023. We also completed the sale of our Austrian business during 2022 and, on April 6, 2022, we completed the sale of our retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Held for Sale,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information on these divestitures. Subsequent to the completion of these divestitures, our foreign currency exchange rate risk will be primarily limited to the Canadian dollar.The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.62Table of ContentsItem 8 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:00.325239

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 9, 2022.Certain statements in this Annual Report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report for additional factors relating to these statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and liquidity, and results of operations.Overview of Our Business:We are a diversified healthcare services leader dedicated to advancing health outcomes for patients everywhere. Our teams partner with biopharma companies, care providers, pharmacies, manufacturers, governments, and others to deliver insights, products, and services to help make quality care more accessible and affordable.30Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We report our financial results in four reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical, Prescription Technology Solutions (“RxTS”), Medical-Surgical Solutions, and International. Our organizational structure also includes Corporate, which consists of income and expenses associated with administrative functions and projects as well as the results of certain investments. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of individual business activities. We evaluate the performance of our operating segments on a number of measures, including revenues and operating profit (loss) before interest expense and income taxes.The following summarizes our four reportable segments. Refer to Financial Note 20, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information regarding our reportable segments.•U.S. Pharmaceutical is a reportable segment that distributes branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs and other healthcare-related products. This segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate site) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services.•Prescription Technology Solutions is a reportable segment that combines automation and our ability to navigate the healthcare ecosystems to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma companies to address patients’ medication access, affordability, and adherence challenges. RxTS also offers prescription price transparency, benefit insight, dispensing support services, third-party logistics, and wholesale distribution support across various therapeutic categories and temperature ranges to biopharma customers throughout the product lifecycle.•Medical-Surgical Solutions is a reportable segment that provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers in the United States (“U.S.”), including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, and home health care agencies. This segment offers national brand medical-surgical products as well as McKesson’s own line of high-quality products through a network of distribution centers within the U.S.•International is a reportable segment that includes our operations in Europe and Canada, bringing together non-U.S.-based drug distribution services, specialty pharmacy, retail, and infusion care services. During fiscal 2023, we completed transactions to sell certain of our businesses in the European Union (“E.U.”) and our retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and during fiscal 2022, we completed the sale of our Austrian business. These divestitures are further described in the “European Divestiture Activities” section below. Our remaining operations in Europe provide distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in Norway where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies. Our operations in Canada deliver vital medicines, supplies and information technology solutions throughout Canada and includes Rexall Health pharmacies.Business Acquisitions and DivestituresRx Savings Solutions, LLCOn November 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Rx Savings Solutions, LLC (“RxSS”), a privately-owned company headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, to further connect our biopharma and payer services to patients. RxSS is a prescription price transparency and benefit insight company that offers affordability and adherence solutions to health plans and employers. The purchase consideration included a payment of $600 million in cash made upon closing and a maximum of $275 million of contingent consideration based on RxSS’ operational and financial performance through calendar year 2025. The payment made upon closing was funded from cash on hand, and we recorded a liability of $92 million as of the acquisition date representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. As of March 31, 2023, the current portion of $83 million is included within “Other accrued liabilities” and the long-term portion of $9 million is included within “Other non-current liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The financial results of RxSS are included in our RxTS segment as of the acquisition date. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.31Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)SCRI Oncology, LLCOn October 31, 2022, we completed a transaction with HCA to form SCRI Oncology, LLC (“SCRI Oncology”), an oncology research business, combining our U.S. Oncology Research (“USOR”) and HCA’s Sarah Cannon Research Institute (“SCRI”) based in Nashville, Tennessee, to advance cancer care and increase access to oncology clinical research. Upon consummation of the transaction, we own a 51% controlling interest in the combined business, and the financial results are consolidated and reported within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment as of the acquisition date. Transaction consideration included the transfer of full ownership interest in USOR to the combined business and $173 million of cash paid to HCA, which was funded from cash on hand. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.European Divestiture ActivitiesOn October 31, 2022, we completed the previously announced transaction to sell certain of our businesses in the E.U. located in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia, along with our German headquarters and wound-care business, part of a shared services center in Lithuania, and our ownership stake in a joint venture in the Netherlands (“E.U. disposal group”) to the PHOENIX Group. As part of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $892 million and divested net assets of $1.3 billion, including cash of $319 million, derecognized the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest held by minority shareholders of McKesson Europe AG (“McKesson Europe”) of $382 million, and released $153 million of net accumulated other comprehensive loss. We recorded net gains of $66 million and net charges of $438 million for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in “Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to remeasure the assets and liabilities of our E.U. disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. The fiscal 2022 charges also included impairments of certain internal-use software that will not be utilized in the future, prior to adjusting the E.U. disposal group as a whole, and net losses of $151 million related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with our E.U. disposal group, driven by declines in the Euro.On April 6, 2022, we completed the previously announced sale of our retail and distribution businesses in the U.K. (“U.K. disposal group”) to Aurelius Elephant Limited for a purchase price of £110 million (or, approximately $144 million), including certain adjustments. As part of the transaction, we divested net assets of $615 million and released $731 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss. During the year ended March 31, 2022, we recorded charges totaling $1.2 billion within “Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations to remeasure the U.K. disposal group to fair value less costs to sell. The remeasurement adjustment included a $734 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with the U.K. disposal group, driven by declines in the British pound sterling.On January 31, 2022, we completed the sale of our Austrian business to Quadrifolia Management GmbH in a management-led buyout for a purchase price of €244 million (or, approximately $276 million), including certain adjustments. During the year ended March 31, 2022, we recognized a loss of $32 million related to this divestiture which was recorded within “Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.As of March 31, 2023, we had no assets or liabilities related to these completed European divestiture activities that met the classification of held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequent to the divestiture activities discussed above, the Company’s European operations primarily consist of its retail and distribution businesses in Norway. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information regarding these acquisition and divestiture transactions.Executive Summary:The following summary provides highlights and key factors that impacted our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2023:•For the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, revenues increased by 5%, gross profit decreased by 6%, total operating expenses decreased by 28%, and other income, net increased by 92%. Refer to the “Overview of Consolidated Results” section below for an analysis of these changes;•Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations attributable to McKesson Corporation increased to $25.05 in fiscal 2023 from $7.26 in the prior year, primarily driven by lower remeasurement charges of the U.K. and E.U. disposal groups recorded in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year, and a lower share count due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases;32Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)•In fiscal 2023, we extended our pharmaceutical distribution partnership with CVS to June 2027; •On November 1, 2022, we completed our acquisition of RxSS.

The transaction consideration included the transfer of full ownership interest in USOR to the combined business and $173 million of cash paid to HCA as discussed in further detail in the “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures” section above;•On October 31, 2022, we completed the sale of our E.U. disposal group and received cash proceeds of $892 million, as discussed in further detail in the “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures” section above;•In October 2022, we received $129 million related to our share of an antitrust settlement. This amount was recorded as a gain within “Cost of sales” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment;•In October 2022, we received $126 million due to early termination of a tax receivable agreement (“TRA”) with Change Healthcare Inc. (“Change”). This amount was recorded as a gain within “Other income, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within Corporate;•During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we terminated our $500 million notional forward starting fixed interest rate swaps and recognized a gain on the termination of $97 million within “Other income, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within Corporate;•In July 2022, we exited one of our investments in equity securities for proceeds of $179 million and recognized a gain of $142 million within “Other income, net” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment;•On March 15, 2023, we retired our $360 million outstanding principal amount of 2.85% Notes due 2023 (the “2.85% Notes”) upon maturity. These notes were repaid using cash on hand;•On February 15, 2023, we completed a public offering of 5.25% Notes due 2026 (the “5.25% Notes”) in a principal amount of $500 million. Proceeds received from this note issuance, net of discounts and offering expenses, were $497 million;•On December 15, 2022, we retired our $400 million outstanding principal amount of 2.70% Notes due 2022 (the “2.70% Notes”) upon maturity. These notes were repaid using cash on hand;•On November 7, 2022, we entered into a syndicated $4.0 billion five-year senior unsecured credit facility (the “2022 Credit Facility”) which matures in November 2027 and replaced our previous syndicated senior unsecured credit facility which was scheduled to mature in September 2024;•Concurrent with our entry into the 2022 Credit Facility, on November 7, 2022, we entered into a $500 million unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the “2022 Term Loan Credit Facility”). We drew $500 million of cash on the term loan in December 2022 which was used for general corporate purposes and was repaid in February 2023 using proceeds from the 5.25% Notes issuance described above;•We returned $3.9 billion of cash to shareholders through $3.6 billion of common stock repurchases under accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs and open market transactions and through $292 million of dividend payments during fiscal 2023. The total remaining authorization outstanding for repurchase of the Company’s common stock at March 31, 2023 was $3.6 billion. In July 2022, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.54 from $0.47 per common share; and•McKesson continued to play a leading role in the fight against the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (“COVID-19”). In fiscal 2021, we began distributing certain COVID-19 vaccines under the direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”). Since then, and through the end of fiscal 2023, we distributed over 480 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to administration sites all across the U.S. and in support of the U.S. government’s international donation mission. Although contributions from sales of COVID-19 tests and our COVID-19 vaccine and related ancillary supply kit distribution programs were favorable to our results for the year ended March 31, 2023, they were less favorable compared to fiscal 2022 as the recovery from the pandemic continued. For a more in-depth discussion of how COVID-19 impacted our business, operations, financial results, and outlook, refer to the COVID-19 section of ""Trends and Uncertainties"" included below.33Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Trends and Uncertainties:Legislative DevelopmentsOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”). Among other provisions, the IR Act includes a 15% corporate minimum tax, a 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of an entity’s own common stock after December 31, 2022, and various drug pricing reforms. Based on our preliminary assessment, we do not currently expect the IR Act to have a material impact on our results of operations, our financial position, or cash flows in the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate the full impact of these legislative changes as they are implemented.The Impact of Inflationary and Global EventsOur business and our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity are impacted by broad economic conditions including rising interest rates, inflation, increased competition for talent, and disruption of the supply chain, as well as by political or civil unrest or military action. Cost inflation generally affects us by increasing transportation, operational, and other administrative costs associated with our business operations which we might not be able to fully pass along to our customers. Although it is difficult to predict the impact that these factors may have on our business in the future, they did not have a material impact on our results of operations, our financial condition, or liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2023.COVID-19 COVID-19 has continued to evolve since it was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts from the continued pandemic recovery, on our business, operations, and financial results. The disclosures below include significant updates that occurred during fiscal 2023 and the financial impacts of COVID-19 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022.Our Role in the Distribution of COVID-19 Vaccines and Ancillary Supply KitsAs a diversified healthcare services leader, we have been well positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and Canada, and in Europe prior to the divestiture of the E.U. and U.K. disposal groups. We work closely with national and local governments, agencies, and industry partners to ensure that available supplies, including personal protective equipment (“PPE”), and medicine reach our customers and their patients.Since December 2020, we have supported the U.S. government as a centralized distributor of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies used to administer vaccines through a contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and, in July 2022, we renewed our relationship with the CDC under this agreement. The results of operations related to this program are reflected in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. We also continue to operate under a contract to manage the assembly, storage, and distribution of ancillary supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccines as directed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the results of which are reflected in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. Our contracts with the CDC and HHS will continue into July 2023.McKesson Canada, and McKesson Europe prior to the divestiture of the E.U. and U.K. disposal groups, support governments and public health entities through distributing COVID-19 vaccines and administering them in pharmacies as well as distributing COVID-19 tests and certain PPE.34Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Trends in our BusinessWe observed growth in prescription volumes within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and stability in patient visits in our primary care business within our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment during the year ended March 31, 2023, compared to the prior year as the recovery from COVID-19 continued. While the U.S. distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and related ancillary kits combined with higher sales for COVID-19 tests, corresponding to increased demand from the spike in positive COVID-19 cases as a result of the Delta and Omicron variants favorably impacted our results during the year ended March 31, 2022, the contributions from COVID-19 tests and our vaccine and related kitting distribution programs decreased year over year in fiscal 2023 primarily driven by lower demand as the pandemic recovery continued.Impact to our Supply Chain We continue to monitor and address the impacts on our supply chain which were initially related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the availability of various products is dependent on our suppliers, their locations, and the extent to which they continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively work with manufacturers, industry partners, and government agencies to meet the needs of our customers. Overall, during fiscal 2023, we had an increase in supply chain costs primarily related to transportation and labor; however, this did not materially impact our results of operations for the year ended March 31, 2023. As potential shortages or disruptions of any products are identified, we address supply continuity, which includes securing additional products when available, sourcing back-up products when needed, and following allocation procedures to maintain and protect supply as much as possible. We utilize business continuity action planning to maintain and protect operations across all locations and facilities.Impact to our Results of Operations, Financial Condition, and LiquidityThe distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment decreased during fiscal 2023 when compared to the same prior year period. The contribution was less than 10% to segment operating profit for each of the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. The financial impacts from our COVID-19 response efforts in the International segment during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were not material to our consolidated or segment operating results.For the year ended March 31, 2023, COVID-19 tests and the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment contributed approximately $765 million and $216 million to segment revenues and segment operating profit, respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2022, the contribution was approximately $1.8 billion to segment revenues and, including total inventory charges as further described below, increased our segment operating profit by approximately $208 million.These COVID-19 related items had a net unfavorable impact on consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2023 compared to the same prior year period, primarily driven by lower demand for COVID-19 tests as well as COVID-19 vaccines and related ancillary supply kits. During the year ended March 31, 2022 we recorded inventory charges totaling $164 million on certain PPE and other related products in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment. We have taken measures to mitigate risks for market price volatility and changes to anticipated customer demand that may require additional write-downs in future periods of other PPE and related product categories.During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we maintained appropriate labor and overall vendor supply levels and experienced no material impacts to our liquidity or net working capital due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid-Related Litigation and ClaimsWe are a defendant in many legal proceedings asserting claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids) in federal and state courts throughout the U.S., and in Puerto Rico and Canada. The plaintiffs in these actions have included state attorneys general, county and municipal governments, tribal nations, hospitals, health and welfare funds, third-party payors, and individuals. 35Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The Company and two other national pharmaceutical distributors (collectively “Distributors”) settled with 48 of 49 eligible states and their participating subdivisions, as well as the District of Columbia and all eligible territories (collectively, “Settling Governmental Entities”) effective on April 2, 2022 (the “Settlement”). Under the Settlement, the Distributors will pay the Settling Governmental Entities up to approximately $20.3 billion over 18 years, with up to approximately $7.8 billion to be paid by the Company for its 38.1% portion. Consent judgments have been entered in all participating states and territories, and approximately 2,300 cases have been dismissed pursuant to the Settlement. A minimum of 85% of the Settlement payments must be used by state and local governmental entities to remediate the opioid epidemic. Most of the remaining percentage relates to plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs, and is payable over a shorter time period. Under the Settlement, the Distributors will establish a clearinghouse to consolidate their controlled-substance distribution data, which will be available to the settling U.S. states to use as part of their anti-diversion efforts. The Settlement provides that the Distributors do not admit liability or wrongdoing and do not waive any defenses.The Settlement only addresses the claims of attorneys general of U.S. states and territories and political subdivisions in participating states and territories. Governmental entities not participating in the Settlement may continue to pursue their claims. The state of Alabama chose not to participate in the Settlement, and West Virginia was not eligible to participate. We have reached separate agreements to settle the claims of these states and their participating subdivisions. The Distributors also settled the claims of federally recognized Native American Tribes.Our total estimated liability for opioid-related claims was $7.2 billion as of March 31, 2023, of which $548 million was included in “Other accrued liabilities” for the amount estimated to be paid prior to March 31, 2024, and the remaining liability was included in “Long-term litigation liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Although the vast majority of opioid claims have been brought by governmental entities in the U.S., the Company is also a defendant in cases brought in the U.S. by private plaintiffs, such as hospitals, health and welfare funds, third-party payors, and individuals, as well as four cases brought in Canada (three by governmental or tribal entities and one by an individual). These claims, and those of private individuals or entities generally, are not included in the Settlement or in the charges recorded by the Company, described above. The Company believes it has valid legal defenses in these matters and intends to mount a vigorous defense.Because of the many uncertainties associated with ongoing opioid-related litigation matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters. In light of the uncertainty, the amount of any ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued.Notwithstanding the Settlement, we also continue to prepare for trial in pending matters. We believe that we have valid defenses to the claims pending against us and, absent an acceptable settlement, intend to vigorously defend against all such claims. An adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations. Refer to Financial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.Risks and Forward-Looking InformationKey assumptions and estimates about future performance and values, including those used in our impairment assessments, can be affected by a variety of factors, including the impacts of socio-political events on industry and economic trends, as well as on our business strategy and internal forecasts. Recent such events include the COVID-19 pandemic and the war between Russia and Ukraine, and the associated economic impacts, which have disrupted aspects of the global economy over the last several years. We have experienced and may experience difficulties in sourcing products and changes in costs and pricing due to the effects of various socio-political events on supply chains. We periodically review our intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Material changes to key assumptions and estimates could decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates that could potentially result in future impairment charges, or otherwise adversely impact our financial position, cash flows or liquidity, or results of operations. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections.36Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Consolidated Results:(In millions, except per share data)Years Ended March 31, 20232022ChangeRevenues$276,711 $263,966 5 %Gross profit12,358 13,130 (6)Gross profit margin4.47 %4.97 %(50)bpTotal operating expenses$(7,977)$(11,092)(28)%Total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues2.88 %4.20 %(132)bpOther income, net$497 $259 92 %Loss on debt extinguishment— (191)(100)Interest expense(248)(178)39 Income from continuing operations before income taxes4,630 1,928 140 Income tax expense(905)(636)42 Reported income tax rate(19.5)%(33.0)%1,350 bpIncome from continuing operations3,725 1,292 188 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax(3)(5)(40)Net income3,722 1,287 189 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests(162)(173)(6)Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation$3,560 $1,114 220 %Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson CorporationContinuing operations$25.05 $7.26 245 %Discontinued operations(0.02)(0.03)(33)Total$25.03 $7.23 246 %Weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding142.2 154.1 (8)%bp - basis points 37Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)RevenuesRevenues increased for the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year largely due to market growth in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Market growth includes growing drug utilization, price increases, and newly launched products, partially offset by price deflation associated with branded to generic drug conversion. This revenue growth was partially offset by lower revenues in our International segment driven by the completed divestitures of our U.K. and E.U. disposal groups and our Austrian business, and unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations.Gross ProfitGross profit decreased for the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily in our International segment driven by the completed divestitures of our U.K. and E.U. disposal groups, our Austrian business, and unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, partially offset by growth of specialty pharmaceuticals and increased contributions from our generics programs in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and an increase in gross profit in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment from prior year inventory charges on certain PPE and other related products and favorability in our core primary care business. Gross profit in fiscal 2023 was also favorably impacted by increased volumes with new and existing customers in our RxTS segment.Gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 included net cash proceeds received of $129 million and $46 million, respectively, representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. Gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2023 also included last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) inventory charges of $1 million and LIFO credits of $23 million in 2022. The LIFO charges in fiscal 2023 compared to LIFO credits in fiscal 2022 are primarily due to higher brand inflation and lower generics deflation, offset by significantly higher off patent launch activity in fiscal 2023. Refer to the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section included in this Financial Review for further information regarding use of the LIFO method of accounting within our U.S. Pharmaceutical business.Total Operating ExpensesA summary and description of the components of our total operating expenses for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:•Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses (“SDG&A”): SDG&A consists of personnel costs, transportation costs, depreciation and amortization, lease costs, professional fee expenses, administrative expenses, remeasurement charges to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell, and other general charges.•Claims and litigation charges, net: These charges and credits include adjustments for estimated probable settlements related to our controlled substance monitoring and reporting, and opioid-related claims, as well as any applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. Legal fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred, are included within SDG&A.•Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net: Charges recorded under this component include those incurred for programs in which we change our operations, the scope of a business undertaken by our business units, or the manner in which that business is conducted, as well as long-lived asset impairments.

The remeasurement adjustment includes a $734 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with the U.K. disposal group, driven by declines in the British pound sterling. Of the total charges recorded during the period, $1.1 billion are included within our International segment and $42 million are included within Corporate expenses, net;•SDG&A includes charges of $438 million to remeasure assets and liabilities of our E.U. disposal group held for sale to fair value less costs to sell and to impair certain internal-use software that will not be utilized in the future. The remeasurement adjustment includes a $151 million loss related to the accumulated other comprehensive loss balances associated with the E.U. disposal group, driven by declines in the Euro. Of the total charges recorded during the period, $383 million are included within our International segment and $55 million are included within Corporate expenses, net;•SDG&A reflects a cost reduction of $142 million related to the cessation of depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and operating lease right-of-use assets classified as held for sale for our European divestiture disposal groups;•SDG&A includes opioid-related charges of $130 million, primarily litigation expenses;•SDG&A includes a gain of $59 million related to the sale of our Canadian health benefit claims management and plan administrative services business;•Claims and litigation charges, net includes a charge of $274 million related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims as previously discussed in the “Trends and Uncertainties” section above;•Restructuring, impairment, and related charges, net includes charges related to Corporate expenses, net, as well as our International segment.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from October 1st to April 1st to align with the change in timing of our annual long-term planning process. This change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge. The annual impairment testing performed in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. However, other risks, expenses, and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions limit our ability to estimate projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of various reporting units in future periods, including our McKesson Canada reporting unit within the International segment, where the risk of material goodwill impairment is higher than other reporting units. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in this Financial Review for further information. At March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the balance of goodwill in our International segment primarily relates to our McKesson Canada reporting unit. Restructuring Initiatives and Long-Lived Asset Impairments During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we approved a broad set of initiatives to drive operational efficiencies and increase cost optimization efforts, with the intent of simplifying our infrastructure and realizing long-term sustainable growth. These initiatives include headcount reductions and the exit or downsizing of certain facilities. We anticipate total charges of approximately $125 million across our RxTS and U.S. Pharmaceutical segments as well as Corporate, consisting primarily of employee severance and other employee-related costs, facility and other exit-related costs, as well as long-lived asset impairments. We recorded charges of $60 million for the year ended March 31, 2023 related to this program, which reflects severance and other employee-related costs within our RxTS segment as well as asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, including certain asset impairments primarily within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment and real estate charges within Corporate. This restructuring program is anticipated to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2024.During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we approved an initiative to increase operational efficiencies and flexibility by transitioning to a partial remote work model for certain employees. This initiative primarily included the rationalization of our office space in North America. Where we ceased using office space, we exited the portion of the facility no longer used. We also retained and repurposed certain other office locations. We recorded charges of $124 million for the year ended March 31, 2022 primarily related to lease right-of-use and other long-lived asset impairments, lease exit costs, and accelerated depreciation and amortization. This initiative was substantially completed in fiscal 2022 after which immaterial charges will continue to be incurred through the termination date of certain leases.In fiscal 2022, we recognized charges totaling $36 million to impair certain long-lived assets within our International segment related to our operations in Denmark and our retail pharmacy businesses in Canada.Refer to Financial Note 3 , “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.Other Income, Net Other income, net increased for the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to:•a gain of $142 million related to the exit of one of our investments in equity securities held within our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment;•a gain of $126 million due to the cash received for the early termination of the TRA entered into as part of the formation of the joint venture with Change, from which McKesson has now exited. This gain was recorded within Corporate expenses, net;•a gain of $97 million from the termination of certain forward starting fixed interest rate swaps within Corporate expenses, net; and•an increase of $97 million in interest income driven by higher interest rates on certain of our cash balances compared to the prior year.40Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)These gains were partially offset by net losses of $36 million recognized for the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to net gains of $98 million recognized for the year ended March 31, 2022 from our equity investments held within Corporate. These amounts primarily reflect mark-to-market net gains and impairments on certain of our investments in U.S. growth stage companies in the healthcare industry and realized net gains on the exit of some of these investments as further described in Financial Note 15, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In future periods, fair value adjustments recognized in our operating results for these types of investments may be adversely impacted by market volatility. Other income, net for the year ended March 31, 2022 also includes a gain of $42 million related to the sale of our 30% interest in our German pharmaceutical wholesale joint venture with Walgreens Boots Alliance (“WBA”).Loss on Debt ExtinguishmentThe loss on debt extinguishment recorded for the year ended March 31, 2022 of $191 million includes premiums of $182 million as well as the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and transaction fees incurred of $9 million, and was driven by our July 2021 tender offer to redeem a portion of our existing debt. Refer to Financial Note 11, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased in 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of higher interest rates and changes in our derivative portfolio primarily as a result of our European divestiture activities. This was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense driven by lower existing debt due to our tender offer in late July 2021. Interest expense may fluctuate based on timing, amounts, and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.Income Tax ExpenseWe recorded income tax expense of $905 million and $636 million for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our reported income tax expense rates were 19.5% and 33.0% in 2023 and 2022, respectively.Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to non-cash charges related to remeasuring the value of our E.U. and U.K. disposal groups held for sale to fair value less costs to sell in fiscal 2022, changes in our business mix of earnings between various taxing jurisdictions, and discrete tax benefits recognized during 2023 and 2022. Refer to Financial Note 6, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $3 million and $5 million for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily represents ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP, Vantage Oncology Holdings, LLC, and the accrual of the annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share that McKesson was obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the December 2014 domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”) through its divestiture in October 2022. For fiscal 2023, noncontrolling interests also includes the proportionate results of SCRI Oncology from its acquisition date in October 2022. Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within our control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests. Refer to the “Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of this Financial Review and Financial Note 7, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on changes to our redeemable and noncontrolling interests that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and the first quarter of 2022.41Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $3.6 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation was $25.03 and $7.23 for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our diluted earnings per share reflects the cumulative effects of share repurchases during each period.Weighted-Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted-average number of shares outstanding of 142.2 million and 154.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding was impacted by the cumulative effect of share repurchases and exercise and settlement of share-based awards.42Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Overview of Segment Results: Segment Revenues: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions)20232022ChangeSegment revenuesU.S. Pharmaceutical$240,616 $212,149 13 %Prescription Technology Solutions4,387 3,864 14 Medical-Surgical Solutions11,110 11,608 (4)International20,598 36,345 (43)Total revenues$276,711 $263,966 5 %U.S. PharmaceuticalU.S. Pharmaceutical revenues for the year ended March 31, 2023 increased $28.5 billion or 13% compared to the prior year. Within the segment, sales to pharmacies and institutional healthcare providers increased $27.0 billion and sales to specialty practices and other increased $1.5 billion. Overall, these increases were primarily due to market growth, including growth in specialty pharmaceuticals driven by higher volumes from retail national account customers, branded pharmaceutical price increases, and higher volumes from other existing customers. These increases were partially offset by branded to generic drug conversions and decreased distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.Prescription Technology SolutionsRxTS revenues for the year ended March 31, 2023 increased $523 million or 14% compared to the prior year due to increased volume with new and existing customers primarily in our third-party logistics and wholesale distribution services as well as higher technology service revenues.Medical-Surgical SolutionsMedical-Surgical Solutions revenues for the year ended March 31, 2023 decreased $498 million or 4% compared to the prior year. Within the segment, sales to primary care customers decreased $307 million driven by lower sales of COVID-19 tests, partially offset by underlying core business growth including higher sales of flu test kits. Sales to extended care customers increased $7 million. Other sales declined $198 million driven by lower contribution from the kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies used to administer COVID-19 vaccines.InternationalInternational revenues for the year ended March 31, 2023 decreased $15.7 billion or 43% compared to the prior year which included $1.9 billion unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Within the segment, sales in Europe declined by $14.8 billion largely due to the completed divestitures of our U.K. and E.U. disposal groups, and Austrian business. This was partially offset by increased sales in Canada of $1.0 billion largely driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes.43Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Segment Operating Profit (Loss) and Corporate Expenses, Net: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions)20232022ChangeSegment operating profit (loss) (1)U.S. Pharmaceutical (2)$3,206 $2,879 11 %Prescription Technology Solutions (3)566 500 13 Medical-Surgical Solutions (4)1,117 959 16 International (5)136 (968)114 Subtotal5,025 3,370 49 Corporate expenses, net (6)(147)(1,073)(86)Loss on debt extinguishment (7)— (191)(100)Interest expense(248)(178)39 Income from continuing operations before income taxes$4,630 $1,928 140 %Segment operating profit (loss) marginU.S. Pharmaceutical1.33 %1.36 %(3)bpPrescription Technology Solutions12.90 12.94 (4)Medical-Surgical Solutions10.05 8.26 179 International0.66 (2.66)332 bp - basis points(1)Segment operating profit (loss) includes gross profit, net of total operating expenses, as well as other income (expense), net, for our reportable segments.

This was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses to support higher volumes, and a decrease in the contribution from our COVID-19 vaccine distribution program.Prescription Technology SolutionsOperating profit increased for the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased volumes with new and existing customers due to growth in our access, affordability, and adherence solutions.Medical-Surgical SolutionsOperating profit increased for the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to favorability in our core primary care business, including favorable illness season testing and sourcing activities, and prior year inventory charges on certain PPE and other related products, partially offset by lower sales of COVID-19 tests and a lower contribution from kitting and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines.InternationalOperating profit for this segment for the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to an operating loss for the prior year was primarily a result of higher remeasurement charges recorded in the prior year related to our divestitures of the U.K. and E.U. disposal groups and our Austrian business, as well as lower restructuring expenses for optimization programs in Canada. This was partially offset by a gain recognized in the prior year from the sale of our Canadian health benefit claims management and plan administrative services business.CorporateCorporate expenses, net decreased for the year ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to:•year-over-year favorability from lower fair value remeasurement adjustments of our E.U. and U.K. disposal groups compared to fiscal 2022;•lower charges related to our estimated liability for opioid-related claims;•a gain related to the cash payment received for the early termination of our TRA with Change; •a gain related to the termination of certain forward starting fixed interest rate swaps;•a decrease in opioid-related costs, primarily litigation expenses;•prior year restructuring charges for the transition to a partial remote work model for certain employees; and •a favorable impact to interest income from higher interest rates on certain of our cash balances compared to the prior year period.These were partially offset by net losses from our equity investments compared to net gains in the prior year period.45Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)FOREIGN OPERATIONSOur foreign operations represented approximately 7% and 14% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.

We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies, including the Canadian dollar and, more significantly prior to our European divestiture activities discussed above, Euro and British pound sterling. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency exchange fluctuations,” which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of our operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In computing the foreign currency exchange fluctuations, we translate our current year results of our operations in foreign countries recorded in local currencies into U.S. dollars by applying their respective average foreign currency exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods reported in U.S. dollars.In July 2021, we announced our intention to exit our businesses in Europe. In fiscal 2023, we completed the previously announced sale of our E.U. and U.K. disposal groups and in fiscal 2022 we completed the previously announced sale of our Austrian business. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information on these European divestitures.Additional information regarding our foreign operations is also included in Financial Note 20, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.BUSINESS COMBINATIONSRefer to Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.FISCAL 2024 OUTLOOKInformation regarding the Company’s fiscal 2024 outlook is contained in the release of our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 financial results included as an exhibit to our Form 8-K furnished to the SEC on May 8, 2023, which is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. That Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in the ""Trends and Uncertainties"" section of this Financial Review, as well as the cautionary statements in Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements, and Item 1A - Risk Factors, in Part I of this Annual Report.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters based upon past experience and management’s judgment that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.46Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Allowances for Credit Losses: Our receivables primarily consist of short-term trade accounts receivable from customers that result from the sale of goods and services. We also provide customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.The Company considers historical credit losses, the current economic environment, customer credit ratings, collections on past due amounts, legal disputes, and bankruptcies, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts to develop its allowance for credit losses. Management reviews these factors quarterly to determine if any adjustments are needed to the allowance. Sales to the Company’s ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), accounted for approximately 68% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 and comprised approximately 42% of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2023. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 27% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 and comprised approximately 21% of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2023. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business, and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2023 are appropriate and consistent in the context of historical methodologies employed, as well as assessment of trends currently available.At March 31, 2023, trade and notes receivables were $17.5 billion prior to allowances of $114 million. Our provision for bad debts was $45 million, $29 million, and $4 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, respectively. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the fiscal 2023 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $17 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst-case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowances for credit losses may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report.Inventories: Inventories consist of merchandise held for resale. We report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the LIFO method which are valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. LIFO method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold and the inventory cost under LIFO approximates market. The majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign and certain domestic locations is based on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and weighted-average purchase prices. Rebates, cash discounts, and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. In determining whether an inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations, and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products, or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.47Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)At March 31, 2023 and 2022, total inventories, net were $19.7 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 64% and 63% of our inventories at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If we had used the moving average method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately $384 million and $383 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We recognized a LIFO charge of $1 million in fiscal 2023 and LIFO credits of $23 million and $38 million in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, all within “Cost of Sales” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The LIFO charge in fiscal 2023 compared to LIFO credits in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 are primarily due to higher brand inflation and lower generics deflation, offset by significantly higher off patent launch activity in fiscal 2023. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. We believe that the moving average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. Business Combinations: We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, including contingent consideration, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business, are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date that we obtain control of the acquired business. Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use a variation of the income approach, whereby a forecast of future cash flows attributable to the asset is discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income approach include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows, and the assessment of the asset’s expected useful life. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Certain business combinations involve the potential for future payments of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones or other agreed-upon events. The liability for the contingent consideration is measured at its fair value as of the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected operational and financial information, the probability of achievement of performance milestones or other agreed-upon events, and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to calculate the present value of the probability-weighted projected financial information. Contingent liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the liability is resolved with changes in fair value being recognized within “Selling, distribution, general, and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significant adjustment to the fair value.Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets:GoodwillAs a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9.9 billion and $9.5 billion of goodwill at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we voluntarily changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from October 1st to April 1st to align with a change in the timing of our annual long-term planning process. This change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the first fiscal quarter and more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. 48Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.We apply the goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded equal to the amount of excess carrying value above the estimated fair value, if any, but not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent within the reporting unit. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the reasonableness of our concluded fair values.Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment testing date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rates, or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry, or other unanticipated events and circumstances may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. Under the market approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the selection of appropriate guideline public companies and the determination of appropriate valuation multiples to apply to the reporting unit. Under the income approach, significant estimates and assumptions also include the determination of discount rates. The discount rates represent the weighted-average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing, which are weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital structure. Included in the estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital is the assumption of an unsystematic risk premium to address incremental uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections.The annual impairment testing performed for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021 did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. The segment change in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 prompted changes in multiple reporting units across the Company and as a result, goodwill included in impacted reporting units was reallocated using a relative fair value approach and assessed for impairment both before and after the reallocation. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $69 million in fiscal 2021 as the estimated fair value of the Europe Retail Pharmacy reporting unit was lower than its reassigned carrying value based on changes in the composition of the Europe Retail Pharmacy reporting unit within the International segment. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the balance of goodwill in the International segment primarily relates to our McKesson Canada reporting unit. The estimated fair value of our McKesson Canada reporting unit in our International segment exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by approximately 30% in fiscal 2023. The goodwill balance of this reporting unit was $1.4 billion at March 31, 2023, or approximately 14% of the consolidated goodwill balance. A decline in estimated future cash flows in excess of approximately 22% for McKesson Canada or an increase in the discount rate in excess of approximately 2% could result in an indication of goodwill impairment for this reporting unit in future reporting periods under the income approach. Other risks, expenses, and future developments, such as additional government actions, increased regulatory uncertainty, and material changes in key market assumptions may require us to further revise the projected cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our other reporting units in future periods. Refer to Financial Note 10, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.49Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Long-Lived AssetsCurrently, all of our intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 25 years. We review intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of intangible and other long-lived assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and the remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our long-lived asset impairments.Long-lived assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are not depreciated or amortized. Fair value is determined based on the total consideration expected to be received by the Company. The fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any remeasurement to the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group. When the net realizable value of a disposal group increases during a period, a gain can be recognized to the extent that it does not increase the value of the disposal group beyond its original carrying value when the disposal group was reclassified as held for sale. Restructuring Charges: We have certain restructuring reserves which require significant estimates related to the timing and amount of future employee severance and other exit-related costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. We generally recognize employee severance costs when payments are probable and amounts are estimable. Costs related to contracts without future benefit or contract termination are recognized at the earlier of the contract termination or the cease-use dates. Other exit-related costs are recognized as incurred. In connection with these restructuring actions, we also assess the recoverability of long-lived assets used in the business, and as a result, we may recognize accelerated depreciation and amortization reflecting shortened useful lives of the underlying assets.Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties, including those used to conclude on the tax-free nature of the separation of the Change Healthcare JV and the unrecognized tax position related to opioid-related litigation and claims, and may differ from the actual amounts of tax benefit recognized. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations.50Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized. Refer to Financial Note 6, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on income tax matters. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a material loss is reasonably possible or probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided.We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on future negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system, and other interested parties. In conjunction with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we considered matters related to ongoing controlled substances claims to which we are a party. At March 31, 2023, our estimated accrued liability for the opioid-related claims of governmental entities was $7.2 billion. Because of the many uncertainties associated with the remaining opioid-related litigation matters, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible losses for all opioid-related litigation matters. We are not able to predict the outcome in these matters, and an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or liquidity. Refer to the “Opioid-Related Litigation and Claims” section of the “Trends and Uncertainties” section of this Financial Review and Financial Note 17, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity through access to the debt market generally and from our credit facilities and commercial paper program, will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term capital expenditures, working capital, and other cash requirements. We remain well-capitalized with access to liquidity from our $4.0 billion 2022 Credit Facility. At March 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and believe we have the ability to continue to meet our debt covenants in the future.51Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The following table summarizes the net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the periods shown:Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions)20232022ChangeNet cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$5,159 $4,434 $725 Investing activities(542)(89)(453)Financing activities(4,368)(6,321)1,953 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash25 55 (30)Change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash classified within Assets held for sale (1)470 (540)1,010 Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$744 $(2,461)$3,205 (1)The fiscal 2023 change reflects a reversal of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash previously classified within assets held for sale at March 31, 2022 as part of the U.K. disposal group and is offset by cash outflows primarily related to the settlement of liabilities which is reflected in operating activities. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.Operating ActivitiesOperating activities provided cash of $5.2 billion and $4.4 billion for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers, inventory receipts, and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements, and vendor payment terms.Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2023 were affected by net income of $3.7 billion adjusted for non-cash items, and an increase in drafts and accounts payable of $3.8 billion offset by increases in inventories and receivables of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, were primarily driven by higher revenues and timing. Our litigation liabilities decreased by $1.1 billion due to payments made during fiscal 2023 associated with the Settlement and separate settlement agreements of opioid-related claims of participating states, subdivisions, and Native American tribes. Other non-cash items within operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2023 includes stock-based compensation of $162 million.Operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 were affected by net income adjusted for non-cash items, including the losses on our European businesses held for sale and our classifications of receivables, drafts and accounts payables, and inventories as held for sale. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information. Excluding the aforementioned classifications, operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 were affected by increases in inventory of $1.2 billion and drafts and accounts payable of $2.8 billion due to timing of purchases, and an increase in receivables of $1.8 billion resulting from timing of collections and higher revenues. Other non-cash items within operating activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes an adjustment to net income of $191 million related to loss on debt extinguishment, non-cash inventory charges totaling $164 million on certain PPE and other related products in our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment, and stock-based compensation of $161 million.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $542 million and $89 million for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2023 includes $867 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $600 million for our acquisition of RxSS and $173 million for our formation of SCRI Oncology with HCA. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2023 also includes $390 million and $168 million in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, respectively, and reflects proceeds from sales of businesses and investments of $1.1 billion, including cash proceeds, net of cash divested, of $573 million from the completed divestiture of our E.U. disposal group, $202 million of net cash from the completed divestiture of our U.K. disposal group, and $179 million of cash from the exit of one of our investments in equity securities in July 2022.52Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes $388 million and $147 million in capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment and capitalized software, respectively. Investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 also includes net cash proceeds of $578 million from sales of businesses and investments, primarily driven by our European divestiture activities described above, including the disposal of our Austria business, and the sale of certain of our equity investments.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $4.4 billion and $6.3 billion for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2023 includes $3.6 billion of cash paid for share repurchases and $292 million of cash paid for dividends. Financing activities also includes cash receipts of $8.5 billion and payments of $8.5 billion for short-term borrowings of commercial paper in fiscal 2023. In November 2022, we entered into the 2022 Term Loan Credit Facility which provided an unsecured term loan facility of up to $500 million, which we drew upon in full in December 2022 and which we subsequently repaid in February 2023. The proceeds of this loan were used for general corporate purposes. In February 2023, we completed a public offering of the 5.25% Notes with net proceeds of $497 million, which were used to repay existing debt. In December 2022, we retired our $400 million outstanding principal amount of the 2.70% Notes and on March 15, 2023, we retired our $360 million outstanding principal amount of the 2.85% Notes, both upon maturity using cash on hand. Cash used for other financing activities generally includes shares surrendered for tax withholding and payments to noncontrolling interests.Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes cash receipts of $11.2 billion and payments of $11.2 billion from short-term borrowings of commercial paper. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes a cash tender offer of $1.1 billion to redeem certain notes with a principal amount of $922 million and the redemption of our 0.63% Euro-denominated notes with a principal amount of €600 million (or, approximately $709 million) prior to the maturity date of August 17, 2021 using cash on hand. This resulted in total repayments of long-term debt during the year ended March 31, 2022 of $1.8 billion, including $184 million of cash paid for premiums and transaction fees. This was partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in August 2021 pursuant to a public offering of 1.30% Notes due 2026 for net proceeds of $498 million, which was utilized for general corporate purposes. Financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 also includes $3.5 billion of cash paid for share repurchases and $277 million of cash paid for dividends. Additionally, financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes payments of $1.0 billion to purchase shares of McKesson Europe through exercises of a put right option by noncontrolling shareholders. Cash used for other financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2022 includes payments to noncontrolling interests, and funds temporarily held on behalf of unaffiliated medical practice groups.Share Repurchase PlansThe Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time to time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by combinations of such methods, any of which may use pre-arranged trading plans that are designed to meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, tax implications, restrictions under our debt obligations, and other market and economic conditions. During the last two years, our share repurchases were transacted through both open market transactions and ASR programs with third-party financial institutions. The ASR programs discussed below were designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c).53Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Information regarding the share repurchase activity over the last two fiscal years was as follows:Share Repurchases (1)(In millions, except price per share data)Total Number ofShares Purchased (2) Average Price Paid Per ShareApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the ProgramsBalance, March 31, 2021$2,785 Shares repurchased - May 2021 ASR5.2 $193.22 (1,000)Shares repurchased - Open market4.6 $217.73 (1,007)Share repurchase authorization increase in fiscal 20224,000 Shares repurchased - February 2022 ASR (3)4.8 $265.56 (1,500)Balance, March 31, 20223,278 Shares repurchased - February 2022 ASR (3)0.3 $295.16 — Shares repurchased - May 2022 ASR3.1 $321.05 (1,000)Share repurchase authorization increase in fiscal 20234,000 Shares repurchased - December 2022 ASR2.6 $369.20 (972)Shares repurchased - Open market (4)4.7 $363.24 (1,693)Balance, March 31, 2023$3,613 (1)This table does not include the value of equity awards surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations or forfeitures of equity awards.(2)The number of shares purchased reflects rounding adjustments.(3)In February 2022, we entered into an ASR program with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of the Company’s common stock. The total number of shares repurchased under this ASR program was 5.1 million shares at an average price per share of $295.16. We received 4.8 million shares as the initial share settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 based on an initial share purchase price, and in May 2022, we received an additional 0.3 million shares upon the completion of this ASR program.(4)Of the total dollar value, $27 million was accrued within “Other accrued liabilities” in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2023 for share repurchases that were executed in late March 2023 and settled in early April 2023.We believe that our future operating cash flow, financial assets, and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that an increase in volatility or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.54Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital ResourcesMarch 31, (Dollars in millions)20232022Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash$4,679 $3,935 Working capital(3,665)(2,235)Days sales outstanding for: (1)Customer receivables22 22 Inventories27 27 Drafts and accounts payable58 55 Debt to capital ratio (2)120.5 %114.5 %(1)Based on year-end balances and sales or cost of sales for the last 90 days of the year.(2)This ratio describes the relationship and changes within our capital resources, and is computed as the sum of total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ deficit, which excludes noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive loss.Cash equivalents, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA-rated U.S. government money market funds, short-term deposits with financial institutions, and short-term commercial papers issued by non-financial institutions. Deposits with financial institutions are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Canadian dollars, Euro, and British pounds sterling. Deposits could exceed the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the U.S. and similar deposit insurance programs in other jurisdictions. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Our cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 included approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the U.S., respectively. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash for foreign operations for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the U.S. is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes. We may remit foreign earnings to the U.S. to the extent it is tax efficient to do so. We do not expect the tax impact from remitting these earnings to be material. Following enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the repatriation of cash to the U.S. is generally no longer taxable for federal income tax purposes. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, and other accrued liabilities. Working capital also includes net assets and liabilities classified as held for sale which have decreased in fiscal 2023 as a result of the divestiture of our E.U. and U.K. disposal groups. Our businesses require substantial investments in working capital that are susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements.Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents, inventory and receivables, driven by higher revenues and timing.Our debt to capital ratio increased for the year ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to share repurchases and net repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by net income attributable to McKesson for the year.In July 2022, we raised our quarterly dividend from $0.47 to $0.54 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. Dividends were $2.09 per share in fiscal 2023 and $1.83 per share in fiscal 2022. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors. In fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we paid total cash dividends of $292 million and $277 million, respectively.55Table of ContentsMD&A IndexMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsOur previously recognized redeemable noncontrolling interests primarily related to our consolidated subsidiary, McKesson Europe. Under the Domination Agreement, the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe had a right to put (“Put Right”) their shares at €22.99 per share, increased annually for interest in the amount of five percentage points above a base rate published semi-annually by the German Bundesbank, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid by McKesson. During fiscal 2022, we paid $1.0 billion to purchase 34.5 million shares of McKesson Europe through exercises of the Put Right by the noncontrolling shareholders, which reduced the balance of our redeemable noncontrolling interests.The Put Right expired on June 15, 2021, at which point the remaining shares owned by the minority shareholders, valued at $287 million, were transferred from redeemable noncontrolling interests to noncontrolling interests and as a result, we no longer have redeemable noncontrolling interests presented in our consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2023 or 2022. Our noncontrolling interest in McKesson Europe was included in the sale of our E.U. disposal group in October 2022, as discussed in more detail in Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures.”Additionally, prior to the sale of our E.U. disposal group in October 2022, we were obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (the “Compensation Amount”) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the Domination Agreement. The Compensation Amount was recognized ratably during the applicable annual period through the October 31, 2022 divestiture. The Domination Agreement did not expire, but it may be terminated at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least six months’ advance notice. Refer to Financial Note 7, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests.Material Cash Requirements: The table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments as of March 31, 2023:Years(In millions)TotalWithin 1Over 1 to 3Over 3 to 5After 5On balance sheetTotal debt (1)$5,594 $968 $1,719 $1,613 $1,294 Operating lease obligations (2) 1,894 340 594 413 547 Other (3) 164 92 26 16 30 Off balance sheetInterest on borrowings (4)1,032 170 265 149 448 Purchase obligations (5)6,547 6,535 12 — — Other (6)360 18 303 18 21 Total$15,591 $8,123 $2,919 $2,209 $2,340 (1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations, including finance lease obligations.

The majority of this amount relates to a global settlement payable in annual installments through 2038 pursuant to the schedule set forth in the agreement. As of March 31, 2023, $548 million is estimated to be paid within the next twelve months.At March 31, 2023, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $974 million. The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. Refer to Financial Note 6, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on income tax matters.At March 31, 2023, our banks and insurance companies have issued $206 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations, pension obligations in Europe, and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.Credit ResourcesWe fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings from our commercial paper issuances. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements, including any future payments that may be made related to our total estimated litigation liability of $7.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 payable under the terms of various settlement agreements for opioid-related claims, are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources, and other capital market transactions. Long-term debt markets and commercial paper markets, our primary sources of capital after cash flow from operations, are open and accessible to us should we decide to access those markets. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 11, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 19, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.57Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.Interest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $4.7 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. At March 31, 2023, we also had fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1.3 billion. The effect of a hypothetical 50 basis points increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, would not have resulted in a material impact to earnings in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.Foreign currency exchange rate risk: We conduct our business worldwide in U.S. dollars and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries, including Canadian dollars, Euro, and British pounds sterling. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results that are reported in U.S. dollars. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign currency-denominated notes and our foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies.We have certain foreign currency exchange rate risk programs that utilize cross-currency swaps which are intended to reduce the income statement effects from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and have been designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency exchange rate risk. However, our risk management programs are designed such that changes in the value of the underlying exposure would be largely offset by the potential changes in the value of the risk management portfolios. Refer to Financial Note 14, “Hedging Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information on our cross-currency swaps.The Company and its subsidiaries are also exposed to balances denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates on underlying balances not reported in the functional currencies of the Company and these subsidiaries would not have resulted in a material impact to our earnings in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Refer to Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” under the section “Foreign Currency Translation” for more information regarding our exposure to transactional gains and losses.In July 2021, we announced our intention to exit our businesses in Europe. We completed the divestitures of our Austrian business in January 2022, the U.K. disposal group in April 2022, and the E.U. disposal group in October 2022. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information on these divestitures. The completion of these divestitures has reduced our foreign currency exchange rate risk as it relates to the Euro and British pound sterling. The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates described above does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.58Table of ContentsItem 8 IndexMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:11:57.818004

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, referred to as the Financial Review, is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year. Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 – Business – Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A – Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We conduct our business through two operating segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions. See Financial Note 21, “Segments of Business,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of these segments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview: Years Ended March 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2010 2009 2008 Revenues $ 108,702 $ 106,632 $ 101,703 Litigation Charge (Credit), Net (20 ) 493 (5 ) Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes $ 1,864 $ 1,064 $ 1,457 Income Tax Expense (601 ) (241 ) (468 ) Income from Continuing Operations 1,263 823 989 Discontinued Operations, Net — — 1 Net Income $ 1,263 $ 823 $ 990 Diluted Earnings Per Common Share Continuing Operations $ 4.62 $ 2.95 $ 3.32 Discontinued Operations — — — Total $ 4.62 $ 2.95 $ 3.32 Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares 273 279 298 Revenues increased 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010 and 5% to $106.6 billion in 2009. The increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. To a lesser extent, revenues for 2010 were also affected by an increase in demand related to the flu season. These increases were partially offset by the loss of several customers in late 2009. Revenues for 2009 were increased by our acquisitions of Oncology Therapeutics Network (“OTN”) in October 2007 and McQueary Brothers Drug Company (“McQueary Brothers”) in May 2008. Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased 75% to $1.9 billion in 2010 and decreased 27% to $1.1 billion in 2009. The increase in 2010 was due to improved gross profit, lower operating expenses compared to 2009, which included the $493 million Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) litigation charge discussed below, and increases in other income, partially offset by higher interest expense. The decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2009 was due to higher operating expenses, primarily caused by the AWP litigation charge, and due to lower other income, partially offset by improved gross profit. 27 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross profit increased 6% to $5.7 billion and 7% to $5.4 billion in 2010 and 2009. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 18 basis points (“bp”) to 5.22% and 11 bp to 5.04% in 2010 and 2009. Gross profit margin increased in 2010 primarily reflecting an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions segments. The increase in our 2009 gross profit margin was primarily due to an improvement in our Distribution Solutions segment margin, partially offset by a decline in our Technology Solutions segment margin. Operating expenses were $3.7 billion, $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Operating expenses for 2010 decreased compared to 2009, which included the AWP litigation charge as further discussed under the caption “Operating Expenses” in this Financial Review. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses for 2010 approximated the same period a year ago primarily due to lower Profit Sharing Investment Plan (“PSIP”) expense as more fully described under the caption “Operating Expenses” in this Financial Review, cost containment efforts, the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters in 2009 and the reversal of a previously established litigation accrual. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives. Operating expenses for 2009 increased primarily due to additional expenses incurred to support our sales growth, expenses associated with our business acquisitions and higher employee compensation. As noted above, operating expenses for 2009 included a pre-tax charge of $493 million for the AWP litigation charge. In 2010, other income, net includes a $17 million pre-tax gain ($14 million after-tax) from the sale of our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions L.L.C. (“MLS”). In 2009, other income, net includes a pre-tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million after-tax) on two equity-held investments and a pre-tax gain of $24 million ($14 million after-tax) from the sale of an equity-held investment. Over the last two years, other income, net was negatively affected by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates and in 2009 was affected by a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance. Interest expense increased 30% to $187 million in 2010 and 1% to $144 million in 2009. Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to our issuance of $700 million of long-term notes in February 2009. Interest expense for 2009 reflects the repayment of $150 million of long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the issuance of $700 million of long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our reported income tax rates were 32.2%, 22.7% and 32.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2009, current income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which, $87 million represents a non-cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. The recognition of these discrete items is primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations. Net income was $1,263 million, $823 million and $990 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and diluted earnings per common share were $4.62, $2.95 and $3.32, which were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases from 2008 to 2010. 28 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Revenues: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Distribution Solutions Direct distribution & services $ 72,210 $ 66,876 $ 60,436 Sales to customers’ warehouses 21,435 25,809 27,668 Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution & services 93,645 92,685 88,104 Canada pharmaceutical distribution & services 9,072 8,225 8,106 Medical-Surgical distribution & services 2,861 2,658 2,509 Total Distribution Solutions 105,578 103,568 98,719 Technology Solutions Services 2,439 2,337 2,240 Software & software systems 571 572 591 Hardware 114 155 153 Total Technology Solutions 3,124 3,064 2,984 Total Revenues $ 108,702 $ 106,632 $ 101,703 Total revenues increased 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010 and 5% to $106.6 billion in 2009. The growth in revenues was primarily driven by our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of revenues. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery and market growth, which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers, offset in part by the greater sales of lower priced generic drugs. This increase was partially offset by the loss of several customers in late 2009. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflecting market growth, our acquisitions of OTN in October 2007 and McQueary Brothers in May 2008 and a shift of revenues from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery. Sales to customers’ warehouses for 2010 decreased compared to prior year primarily due to a shift of revenues to direct store delivery, reduced revenues associated with a large customer and the loss of a large customer in mid-2009, partially offset by expanded business with existing customers. Sales to customers’ warehouses decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflecting a customer’s loss of business, the loss of a large customer and reduced revenues associated with the consolidation of certain customers. Additionally, 2009 revenues were also impacted by a shift to direct store delivery. These decreases were partially offset by expanded business with existing customers. Sales to retail customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large self-warehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer) directly to our customers’ warehouses. This distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the Company as a stand-alone service; rather, it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal self-warehousing distribution network. Sales to customers’ warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the Company as one source for both their direct-to-store business and their warehouse business. We generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers’ warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low cost-to-serve model on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars. 29 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) The customer mix of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution revenues was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Direct Sales Independents 12 % 13 % 13 % Institutions 32 32 30 Retail Chains 32 26 24 Subtotal 76 71 67 Sales to retail customers’ warehouses 24 29 33 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % In 2010, the percentage of total direct and warehouse revenue attributed to the Company’s retail chain customers compared to our other customer groups increased slightly from the same period a year ago, while it declined in 2009. In 2009, this decline resulted in a positive impact on the Company’s gross profit margin. As previously described, a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both the Company’s direct and warehouse distribution methods, the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low cost-to-serve model. When evaluating and pricing customer contracts, we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability. As a result, we do not evaluate the Company’s performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers’ warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2010 increased on a constant currency basis by 7% from prior year primarily due to market growth, which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers and a favorable foreign exchange rate of 3%. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2009 increased slightly primarily reflecting market growth, which was almost fully offset by 9% unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the loss of a customer. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting an increase in demand related to the flu season, acquisitions and increased volume from new and existing customers. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased for 2009 from prior year primarily reflecting market growth and acquisitions. In addition, revenues in 2008 were impacted by the discontinuance of the distribution of a product line. Revenues associated with this product line are now recorded by our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services business. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2010 compared to prior year due to higher services revenues primarily caused by increases in outsourcing revenues for claims processing and other services and software maintenance reflecting the segment’s expanded customer base. These increases were partially offset by a shift to products that have higher revenue deferral rates and lower hardware sales. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2009 primarily due to increased services revenues primarily reflecting the segment’s expanded customer base and outsourcing revenues for claims processing. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a decrease in software revenues, particularly in the hospital and physician office customer channels. 30 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Gross Profit Distribution Solutions $ 4,219 $ 3,955 $ 3,586 Technology Solutions 1,457 1,423 1,423 Total $ 5,676 $ 5,378 $ 5,009 Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions 4.00 % 3.82 % 3.63 % Technology Solutions 46.64 46.44 47.69 Total 5.22 5.04 4.93 Gross profit increased 6% to $5.7 billion in 2010 and 7% to $5.4 billion in 2009. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 18 bp in 2010 and 11 bp in 2009. Gross profit margin increased in 2010 primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both of our operating segments. Our Distribution Solutions segment margin increased primarily due to flu-related demand. Our Technology Solutions segment margin improved reflecting a change in revenue mix. In 2009, the increase in our Distribution Solutions gross profit margin was partially offset by a decline in our Technology Solutions segment reflecting a change in revenue mix and the recognition of $21 million of disease management deferred revenues in 2008 for which associated expenses were previously recognized as incurred. In 2010, our Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to the impact of the H1N1 flu virus, which helped drive an improved mix of higher margin revenues stemming from increased flu-related demand across our distribution businesses. Gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a higher buy side margin, which primarily reflects compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in sell margin. Our last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) net inventory expense was $8 million for 2010 and 2009. In 2009, our Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2008. Gross profit margin was impacted by the benefit of increased sales of generic drugs with higher margins; higher buy side margins and an increase associated with a lower proportion of revenues within the segment attributed to sales to customers’ warehouses, which generally have lower gross profit margins relative to other revenues within the segment. These increases were partially offset by a modest decline in sell margin during the latter part of the year and LIFO net inventory credits ($8 million LIFO net expense in 2009 compared to a $14 million LIFO net credit in 2008). Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The practice in the Distribution Solutions’ distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those years. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” included in this Financial Review. For each of the last three years, the Company’s sales to customers’ warehouses represented 5% or less of the segment’s total gross profit dollars. In 2010, the percentage of total direct and warehouse revenue attributed to our retail chain customers compared to our other customer groups increased slightly from the same period a year ago, while it declined in 2009. In 2009, this decline resulted in a positive impact on the Company’s gross profit margin. 31 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2010, our Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin was favorably affected by a change in revenue mix, partially offset by a higher software revenue deferral rate. In 2009, our Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin decreased compared to the prior year primarily reflecting a change in revenue mix and the recognition in 2008 of $21 million of disease management deferred revenues for which associated expenses were previously recognized as incurred. Operating Expenses: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Operating Expenses Distribution Solutions (1) $ 2,260 $ 2,777 $ 2,138 Technology Solutions 1,077 1,096 1,115 Corporate 351 309 283 Subtotal 3,688 4,182 3,536 Litigation (credit), net (20 ) — (5 ) Total $ 3,668 $ 4,182 $ 3,531 Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Revenues Distribution Solutions 2.14 % 2.68 % 2.17 % Technology Solutions 34.48 35.77 37.37 Total 3.37 3.92 3.47 (1) Operating expenses for 2009 include the $493 million AWP litigation charge. Operating expenses decreased 12% to $3.7 billion in 2010 and increased 18% to $4.2 billion in 2009. Operating expenses for 2010 decreased compared to 2009, which included the AWP litigation charge as more fully described below. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses for 2010 approximated the same period a year ago primarily due to lower PSIP expense as more fully described below, cost containment efforts, the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters in 2009 and the reversal of a previously established litigation accrual. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses for 2009 increased primarily due to additional expenses incurred to support our sales growth, expenses associated with our business acquisitions and higher employee compensation. The McKesson Corporation PSIP is a member of the settlement class in the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. On April 27, 2009, the court issued an order approving the distribution of the settlement funds. On October 9, 2009, the PSIP received approximately $119 million of the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action proceeds. Approximately $42 million of the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP participants during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class-holding period and were allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010. Approximately $77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares (the “Unallocated Proceeds”) of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP in an employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) suspense account. In accordance with the plan terms, the PSIP distributed all of the Unallocated Proceeds to current PSIP participants after the close of the plan year in April 2010. The receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP was reimbursement for the loss in value of the Company’s common stock held by the PSIP in its ESOP suspense account during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class-holding period and was not a contribution made by the Company to the PSIP or ESOP. Accordingly, there were no accounting consequences to the Company’s financial statements relating to the receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP. 32 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) The Company’s PSIP expense for the full year is negligible, as the Company did not make additional contributions to the PSIP or ESOP. As a result, our compensation expense in 2010 was lower than 2009. During 2009 and 2008, PSIP expense was $53 million and $13 million. The expense for 2008 was lower than 2009 due to the utilization of lower cost basis shares from the ESOP to fund our matching contributions. The expense for 2011 is expected to be approximately $58 million. PSIP expense by segment for the last three years was as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Distribution Solutions $ — $ 23 $ 5 Technology Solutions 1 28 7 Corporate — 2 1 PSIP expense $ 1 $ 53 $ 13 Cost of sales (1) $ — $ 12 $ 3 Operating expenses 1 41 10 PSIP expense $ 1 $ 53 $ 13 (1) Amounts recorded to cost of sales pertain solely to our Technology Solutions segment. Over the last three years, we recorded the following reduction in workforce and restructuring charges: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Other workforce reduction charges, net (1) Distribution Solutions $ 9 $ 7 $ — Technology Solutions 11 25 8 Total 20 32 8 Restructuring charges (credits), net Distribution Solutions (2) 1 4 8 Technology Solutions (3) — (2 ) 9 Corporate 1 (1 ) 2 Total 2 1 19 Total reduction in workforce and restructuring charges $ 22 $ 33 $ 27 Cost of sales (4) $ 5 $ 5 $ 7 Operating expenses 17 28 20 Total reduction in workforce and restructuring charges $ 22 $ 33 $ 27 (1) Although other workforce reduction actions do not constitute a restructuring plan as defined under U.S. GAAP, they do represent independent actions taken from time-to-time, as appropriate. Other workforce reduction charges also reflected related facility exit costs of $4 million and $3 million in 2010 and 2009 for our Technology Solutions segment. (2) In 2008, we incurred $4 million of severance costs associated with the closure of two facilities and $1 million and $3 million of severance and asset impairments associated with the integration of OTN. (3) In 2008, we incurred $5 million of severance and exit-related costs and a $4 million asset impairment charge for the write-off of capitalized software costs associated with the termination of a software project. (4) Amounts recorded to cost of sales generally pertain to our Technology Solutions segment. 33 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) On a segment basis, Distribution Solutions’ operating expenses decreased in 2010 and increased in 2009 primarily due to the $493 million AWP litigation charge in 2009. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2010 primarily due to the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters of 2009, lower PSIP expense in 2010 and our continued focus on cost containment, partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with our 2009 business acquisitions. Excluding the AWP litigation charge, operating expenses in 2009 increased primarily due to business acquisitions and additional costs incurred to support our sales volume growth. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2009 primarily due to the AWP litigation charge as well as additional costs incurred to support our sales volume growth. As discussed in Financial Note 18, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” in 2009 we reached an agreement to settle all private party claims relating to First DataBank, Inc.’s published drug reimbursement benchmarks for $350 million. We also recorded an accrual for pending and expected AWP-related claims by public payors, which is currently estimated to be $143 million. The combination of the AWP settlement for all private party claims and the decision by us to establish an estimated accrual for the pending and expected AWP-related claims by public payors resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $493 million in the third quarter of 2009. Technology Solutions segment’s operating expenses decreased over the past two years. Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2010 benefited from lower PSIP expense, cost containment efforts and reduction in workforce plans implemented in 2009, partially offset by our continued investment in research and development activities. Operating expenses for 2009 decreased primarily due to cost containment efforts and a decrease in bad debt expense, partially offset by an increase in net research and development expenses and additional costs for business acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for this segment decreased for 2009 primarily reflecting the segment’s cost containment efforts and a more favorable business mix. Corporate expenses have increased over the last two years. Corporate expenses for 2010 increased primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs, other business initiatives and legal settlement charges, partially offset by the reversal of a previously established litigation accrual. Corporate expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflecting an increase in accounts receivable sales facility fees, compensation expense and additional costs incurred to support various initiatives. Other Income, net: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 By Segment Distribution Solutions $ 29 $ (20 ) $ 35 Technology Solutions 5 7 11 Corporate 9 25 75 Total $ 43 $ 12 $ 121 In 2010, other income, net includes a $17 million pre-tax gain ($14 million after-tax) from the sale of our 50% equity interest in MLS. The gain on sale of our investment in MLS was recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. The increase in other income, net was partially offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates in 2010. Interest income, which is primarily recorded in Corporate, was $16 million, $31 million and $89 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In 2009, other income, net included a pre-tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million after-tax) on two equity-held investments (as further described below) and a pre-tax gain of $24 million ($14 million after-tax) from the sale of our 42% equity interest in Verispan, LLC (“Verispan”). The impairment charge and the gain on sale of our investment in Verispan were both recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. Excluding these items, other income, net decreased primarily due to a decrease in interest income from lower average cash and cash equivalents balances and interest rates. 34 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined that the fair value of our interest in Parata was lower than its carrying value and that such impairment was other-than-temporary. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results and market capitalization rates. We determined the impairment was other-than-temporary based on our assessment of all relevant factors including deterioration in the investee’s financial condition and weak market conditions. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax impairment of $58 million ($55 million after-tax) on this investment which is recorded within other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Our investment in Parata is accounted for under the equity method of accounting within our Distribution Solutions segment. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we also recorded a pre-tax impairment of $5 million ($5 million after-tax) on another equity-held investment within our Distribution Solutions segment.

(2) Operating expenses for 2009 for our Distribution Solutions segment included the $493 million pre-tax AWP litigation charge. (3) Other income, net for 2010 for our Distribution Solutions segment included the MLS pre-tax gain of $17 million and for 2009 included $63 million of pre-tax charges to write-down two equity-held investments and a $24 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our equity investment in Verispan. In 2010, operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment increased primarily due to a higher gross profit margin, lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and the gain on sale of the segment’s 50% equity investment in MLS. Operating expenses improved due to the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters of 2009 and lower PSIP expense, partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with our business acquisitions. Results for 2009 included the $493 million AWP litigation charge, $63 million of pre-tax charges to write-down two equity-held investments and a $24 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the segment’s 42% equity investment in Verispan. In 2009, operating profit margin in our Distribution Solutions segment decreased compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues as a result of the AWP litigation charge and a decrease in other income, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin. 35 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2010, operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased compared to 2009 primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and an improvement in gross profit margin. In 2009, operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased compared to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin. Operating profit margin for this segment for the past two years has benefited from cost containment efforts and a more favorable revenue mix. Corporate expenses, net of other income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in interest income. Corporate expenses, net of other income, increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in interest income and an increase in operating expenses. Litigation Credit, Net: In 2010 and 2008 we recorded net credits of $20 million and $5 million relating to settlements for the securities litigation. Interest Expense: Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to the prior year primarily due to our issuance of $700 million of long-term notes in February 2009. Interest expense increased slightly in 2009 compared to the prior year, which reflects the repayment of $150 million of long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the issuance of $700 million of long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2009. Refer to our discussion under the caption “Credit Resources” within this Financial Review for additional information regarding our financing activities. Income Taxes: Our reported tax rates were 32.2%, 22.7% and 32.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In addition to the items noted below, fluctuations in our reported tax rate are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In 2009, we recorded a $182 million income tax benefit for the AWP litigation accrual. The tax benefit could change in the future depending on the resolution of the pending and expected claims. In 2009, current income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which $87 million represents a non-cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. The recognition of these discrete items was primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations. In 2008, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) began its examination of our fiscal years 2003 through 2006. In 2009 and 2010, we received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for a total of $62 million related to transfer pricing for 2003, 2004 and 2005. We paid the CRA assessments to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003 and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 and 2005. We believe we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results. In nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years prior to 2003 are no longer subject to examination. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all remaining income tax uncertainties. In 2008, the IRS completed an examination of our consolidated income tax returns for 2000 to 2002 resulting in a signed Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”), which was subsequently approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The IRS and the Company agreed to certain adjustments, primarily related to transfer pricing and income tax credits. As a result of the approved RAR, we recognized approximately $25 million of net federal and state income tax benefits in 2008. Discontinued Operations: No charges for discontinued operations were incurred during 2010 and 2009. In 2008, discontinued operations included $1 million from the Company’s Acute Care business, which was sold in 2007. 36 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Net Income: Net income was $1,263 million, $823 million and $990 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008 and diluted earnings per common share were $4.62, $2.95 and $3.32. The net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2009 included a pre-tax charge of $493 million ($311 million after-tax) for the AWP litigation as discussed in further detail under the caption “Operating Expenses” in this Financial Review. Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 273 million, 279 million and 298 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008. The decrease in the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding over the past two years primarily reflects a decrease in the number of shares outstanding as a result of stock repurchased, partially offset by exercise of share-based awards. International Operations International operations accounted for 8.6%, 7.9% and 8.2% of 2010, 2009 and 2008 consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our international operations is also included in Financial Note 21, “Segments of Business,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Business Combinations and Investments In 2009, we made the following acquisition: On May 21, 2008, we acquired McQueary Brothers of Springfield, Missouri for approximately $190 million. McQueary Brothers is a regional distributor of pharmaceutical, health and beauty products to independent and regional chain pharmacies in the Midwestern U.S. This acquisition expanded our existing U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. During the first quarter of 2010, the acquisition accounting was completed. Approximately $126 million of the purchase price allocation has been assigned to goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits from synergies to be realized upon integrating the business. Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $61 million representing a customer relationship with a useful life of 7 years, a trade name of $2 million with a useful life of less than one year and a not-to-compete agreement of $4 million with a useful life of 4 years. Financial results for McQueary Brothers have been included within our Distribution Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. In 2008, we made the following acquisition: On October 29, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of OTN of San Francisco, California for approximately $519 million, including the assumption of debt and net of $31 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired from OTN. During the third quarter of 2009, the acquisition accounting was completed. OTN is a U.S. distributor of specialty pharmaceuticals. The acquisition of OTN expanded our existing specialty pharmaceutical distribution business. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. Financial results for OTN are included within our Distribution Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. Approximately $240 million of the purchase price allocation has been assigned to goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits from synergies upon integrating the business. Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $115 million representing customer relationships with a weighted-average life of 9 years, developed technology of $3 million with a weighted-average life of 4 years and trademarks and trade names of $10 million with a weighted-average life of 5 years. 37 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions and investments within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and for certain recent acquisitions may be subject to change as we continue to evaluate and implement various restructuring initiatives. Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations and Investments,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussions regarding our acquisitions and investing activities. 2011 Outlook Information regarding the Company’s 2011 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 3, 2010. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 — Business — Forward-looking Statements and Item 1A — Risk Factors in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. At March 31, 2010, revenues and accounts receivable from our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53% of consolidated revenues and 45% of accounts receivable. At March 31, 2010, revenues and accounts receivable from our two largest customers, CVS and Rite Aid, represented approximately 15% and 12% of total consolidated revenues and 14% and 10% of accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 38 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2010 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue. At March 31, 2010, trade and notes receivables were $7,375 million prior to allowances of $131 million. In 2010, 2009 and 2008 our provision for bad debts was $17 million, $29 million and $41 million. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.8% and 2.2%. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2010 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on receivables of approximately $7 million. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method and the cost of Canadian inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined by the standard cost method. Rebates, fees, cash discounts, allowances, chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $9.4 billion and $8.5 billion at March 31, 2010 and 2009. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 87% and 88% of our inventories at March 31, 2010 and 2009. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $93 million and $85 million. LIFO reserves include both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2010 and 2009, we recognized net LIFO expense of $8 million and in 2008, net LIFO credits of $14 million within our consolidated statements of operations. In 2010, our $8 million net LIFO expense related to our non-pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the FIFO inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or inventory as valued under FIFO. Primarily due to continued deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $112 million and $107 million higher than FIFO as of March 31, 2010 and 2009. As a result, in 2010 and 2009, we recorded LCM charges of $5 million and $64 million within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market. As deflation in generic pharmaceuticals continues, we anticipate that LIFO credits from the valuation of our pharmaceutical products will be fully offset by LCM reserves. In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We provide reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, if indicated, as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. 39 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Prior to April 1, 2009, amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) were expensed at the date of acquisition. Effective April 1, 2009, acquired IPR&D is measured at fair value using market participant assumptions and initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Capitalized IPR&D is amortized over its estimated useful life once the asset is put in service. Capitalized IPR&D is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset’s carrying amount. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available near the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Effective April 1, 2009, contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Contingent consideration classified as a liability is remeasured at fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period and changes to the fair value are included in the current period’s earnings. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured subsequently. Several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset or liability acquired. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations and Investments,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $3,568 million and $3,528 million of goodwill at March 31, 2010 and 2009. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit. Management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing. 40 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, a second step would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment, which would be recorded as a charge in our consolidated statements of operations. Fair values can be determined using the market, income or cost approach. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. The judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2010 and 2009, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Supplier Incentives: Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory. Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, supplier reserves were $89 million and $113 million. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2010 and 2009 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. A hypothetical 0.1% percentage increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a percentage of trade payables would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $13 million in 2010. The ultimate outcome of any amounts due from our suppliers may be different from our estimate. 41 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,187 million and $1,447 million at March 31, 2010 and 2009 and deferred tax liabilities of $1,845 million and $1,889 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and other assets. We established valuation allowances of $97 million against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to federal, state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $19 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for 2010. Share-Based Compensation: Our compensation programs include share-based compensation. We account for all share-based compensation transactions using a fair-value based measurement method. The share-based compensation expense is recognized, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions. For awards with performance conditions and multiple vest dates, we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis. For awards with performance conditions and a single vest date, we recognize the expense on a straight-line basis. We estimate the grant-date fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. We believe that it is difficult to accurately measure the value of an employee stock option. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process, among others, are the expected life of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor and the expected dividend yield. In determining the expected life of the option, we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns. We use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor. We believe that this market-based input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations. Once the fair values of employee stock options are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual experience. 42 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In addition, we develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards, which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on share-based compensation expense. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. We re-assess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period. Such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures. As required, the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates. Our assessments of estimated share-based compensation charges are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These variables include the volatility of our stock price, employee stock option exercise behavior, timing, number and types of annual share-based awards and the attainment of performance goals. As a result, the future share-based compensation expense may differ from the Company’s historical amounts. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. We record a provision for a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts them to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, these decisions often involve a series of complex assessments by management about future events that can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions and it is possible that the actual cost of these matters could impact our earnings, either negatively or positively, in the period of their resolution. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and short-term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, from time-to-time, we may access the long-term debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities. Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,316 million in 2010, compared to $1,351 million in 2009 and $869 million in 2008. Operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the AWP litigation private payor settlement payments of $350 million. Cash flows from operations can also be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Operating activities for 2009 include a non-cash charge of $493 million and the related income tax benefit of $182 million for the AWP litigation charge. Operating activities for 2009 reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth as well as longer payment terms for certain customers and improvement in our net financial inventory (inventory, net of drafts and accounts payable). Operating activities for 2008 were affected by a use of cash of $962 million due to the release of restricted cash for our Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. In addition, operating activities in 2008 reflect changes in our working capital accounts due to revenue growth. 43 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Net cash used in investing activities was $309 million in 2010 compared to $727 million in 2009 and $5 million in 2008. Investing activities for 2010 include $199 million and $179 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software and the release of $55 million of restricted cash from escrow related to the AWP litigation settlement payments. Investing activities for 2009 included $358 million of cash payments for business acquisitions, including the McQueary Brothers acquisition for approximately $190 million. Investing activities for 2008 benefited from the $962 million release of restricted cash for our Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. Investing activities included $610 million in 2008 of cash paid for business acquisitions, including OTN. Financing activities utilized cash of $421 million in 2010, provided cash of $178 million in 2009 and utilized cash of $1,470 million in 2008. Financing activities for 2010 include $323 million in cash paid for share repurchases and $218 million in cash paid on our long-term debt, which primarily consisted of $215 million paid on the maturity of our 9.13% Series C Senior Notes in March 2010. Financing activities for 2009 include our February 2009 issuance of $350 million of 6.50% notes due 2014 and $350 million of 7.50% notes due 2019. Net proceeds of $693 million from the issuance of the notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used by the Company for general corporate purposes. Financing activities for 2009 were also impacted by $502 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $116 million of dividends paid and $97 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2008 included $1.7 billion of cash paid for stock repurchases and $70 million of dividends paid, partially offset by $354 million of cash receipts from common stock issuances. The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. This authorization is described in more detail in Financial Note 19, “Stockholders’ Equity,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company repurchased $299 million, $484 million and $1,686 million of its common stock at average prices of $41.47, $50.52 and $59.48. As of March 31, 2010, $531 million remained available for future repurchases under the outstanding April 2008 Board approved share repurchase plan. In April 2010, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. In July 2008, the Board authorized the retirement of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be repurchased from time-to-time pursuant to its stock repurchase program. During the second quarter of 2009, all of the 4 million repurchased shares, which we purchased for $204 million, were formally retired by the Company. The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. As such, $165 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, as evidenced by our debt issuance in February 2009, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. 44 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,731 $ 2,109 $ 1,362 Working capital 4,492 3,065 2,438 Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (1,434 ) 403 435 Debt to capital ratio (1) 23.4 % 28.9 % 22.7 % Net debt to net capital employed (2) (23.5 )% 6.1 % 6.6 % Return on stockholders’ equity (3) 18.7 % 13.2 % 15.6 % (1) Ratio is computed as total debt divided by total debt and stockholders’ equity. (2) Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (“net debt”), divided by net debt and stockholders’ equity (“net capital employed”). (3) Ratio is computed as net income, divided by a five-quarter average of stockholders’ equity. Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2010, included approximately $1.2 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. We may temporarily access cash held by foreign subsidiaries without subjecting us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax through intercompany loans. A notice issued by the IRS in January 2009 announced that the Treasury Department will, for a temporary period, extend the permitted duration of such intercompany loans that qualify for suspended deemed dividend treatment under Section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to the IRS notice, such intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent must be less than 60 days in duration and borrowing activities cannot exceed 180 cumulative days during the year. At March 31, 2010, there were no intercompany loans outstanding. The position set forth in the notice will apply for the Company until March 31, 2011. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and customer requirements. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2010, compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in net financial inventory and repayment of $215 million of our long-term debt in March 2010. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2009, compared to March 31, 2008, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, partially offset by our $493 million AWP litigation accrual and a higher current portion of long-term debt. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed decreased at March 31, 2010, compared to March 31, 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents and repayment of $215 million of our long-term debt in March 2010. This ratio decreased at March 31, 2009, compared to March 31, 2008, primarily reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by our issuance of $700 million of long-term debt. The Company has paid quarterly cash dividends at the rate of $0.06 per share on its common stock since the fourth quarter of 1999. In April 2008, the quarterly dividend was raised from six cents to twelve cents per share. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid total cash dividends of $131 million, $116 million and $70 million. 45 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Contractual Obligations: The table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2010: Years (In millions) Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5 On balance sheet Long-term debt (1) $ 2,296 $ 3 $ 919 $ 350 $ 1,024 Other (2) 300 22 48 128 102 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3) 879 149 258 156 316 Purchase obligations (4) 3,272 3,059 121 66 26 Customer guarantees (5) 146 64 25 6 51 Operating lease obligations (6) 363 106 140 67 50 Total $ 7,256 $ 3,403 $ 1,511 $ 773 $ 1,569 (1) Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations. See Financial Note 12, “Long-Term Debt and Other Financing,” for further information. (2) Represents our estimated benefit payments for the unfunded benefit plans and minimum funding requirements for the pension plans. (3) Primarily represents interest that will become due on our fixed rate long-term debt obligations. (4) A purchase obligation is defined as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases, capital commitments and service agreements. (5) Represents primarily agreements with certain of our customers’ financial institutions (primarily for our Canadian business) under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of inventory at a discount in the event these customers are unable to meet certain obligations to those financial institutions. Among other limitations, these inventories must be in resalable condition. The inventory repurchase agreements mostly range from one to two years. Customer guarantees range from one to five years and were primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain customers. The majority of our other customer guarantees are secured by certain assets of the customer. At March 31, 2010, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and other customer guarantees were $124 million and $17 million. We consider it unlikely that we would make significant payments under these guarantees and accordingly, no amounts had been accrued at March 31, 2010. Refer to Financial Note 17, “Financial Guarantees and Warranties,” for further information. (6) Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases. See Financial Note 16, “Lease Obligations,” for further information. At March 31, 2010, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $514 million. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the Company has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. In addition, at March 31, 2010, our banks and insurance companies have issued $111 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs. 46 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Credit Resources: We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, our accounts receivable sales facility, short-term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper. Long-Term Debt In March 2010, we repaid our $215 million 9.13% Series C Senior notes, which had matured. On February 12, 2009, we issued 6.50% notes due February 15, 2014, (the “2014 Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million and 7.50% notes due February 15, 2019, (the “2019 Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning on August 15, 2009. The 2014 Notes will mature on February 15, 2014 and the 2019 Notes will mature on February 15, 2019. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $693 million from the issuance of the 2014 Notes and 2019 Notes for general corporate purposes. Our senior debt credit ratings from S&P, Fitch, and Moody’s are currently A-, BBB+ and Baa3, and our commercial paper ratings are currently A-2, F-2 and P-3. Our ratings outlook is stable with S&P, Fitch, and Moody’s. Accounts Receivable Sales Facility In May 2009, we renewed our accounts receivable sales facility for an additional one-year period under terms similar to those previously in place. The renewed facility will expire in mid-May 2010. Based on our existing accounts receivable sales facility agreement, we anticipate that activity under this facility may, for U.S. GAAP purposes, be considered as a secured borrowing rather than a sale under accounting standards that will become effective for us on April 1, 2010. We anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration. The aggregate commitment of the purchasers under this facility is $1.1 billion, although from time-to-time, the available amount may be less than that amount based on concentration limits and receivable eligibility requirements. Through this facility, McKesson Corporation, the parent company, sells certain U.S. pharmaceutical trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary, which then sells these receivables to a special purpose entity (“SPE”), which is a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of McKesson Corporation that is consolidated in our financial statements. This SPE then sells undivided interests in the receivables to third-party purchaser groups, each of which includes commercial paper conduits, which are special purpose legal entities administered by financial institutions. Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in Financial Notes 1 and 12, “Significant Accounting Policies” and “Long-Term Debt and Other Financing,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revolving Credit Facility We have a syndicated $1.3 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in June 2012. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based upon either a Prime rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate. There were no borrowings under this facility in 2010 and $279 million for 2009. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. 47 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Commercial Paper We issued and repaid commercial paper of nil and approximately $3.3 billion and $260 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008. There were no commercial paper issuances outstanding at March 31, 2010 and 2009. Debt Covenant Our various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2010, this ratio was 23.4% and we were in compliance with our other financial covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings, or the lack of compliance with our covenants, could negatively impact our ability to finance operations or issue additional debt at acceptable interest rates. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 20, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS New accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 48 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by 50 bp in 2010, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. Should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2010, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $16 million. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $2,548 million and $2,545 million. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. Foreign exchange risk: We derive revenues and earnings from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries, Israel, Asia Pacific and Mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. As of March 31, 2010, an adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 49 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:14.131326

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, referred to as the Financial Review, is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year. Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 — Business — Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A — Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We conduct our business through two operating segments: Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions. See Financial Note 20, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of these segments.

Revenues increased 3% to $112.1 billion in 2011 and 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010. The increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. Additionally, revenues for 2011 benefited from our December 30, 2010 acquisition of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. (“US Oncology”) of The Woodlands, Texas and revenues for 2010 benefited to a lesser extent from an increase in demand related to the flu season. Partially offsetting the 2010 increases, revenues for that year were affected by the loss of several customers in late 2009. 28 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross profit increased 5% to $6.0 billion in 2011 and 6% to $5.7 billion in 2010. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 11 basis points (“bp”) to 5.33% and 18 bp to 5.22% in 2011 and 2010. The increase in our 2011 gross profit margin was primarily due to an increase in buy margin and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs in our Distribution Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our Technology Solutions segment margin which included a $72 million asset impairment charge. The increase in our 2010 gross profit margin was primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions segments. Operating expenses were $4.1 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.2 billion in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Operating expenses include pre-tax charges (credit) of $213 million, $(20) million and $493 million relating to our securities and Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) litigation matters. Excluding these charges (credit), operating expenses increased in 2011 primarily reflecting higher employee compensation costs including expenses associated with our Profit Sharing Investment Plan (“PSIP”) as well as due to our acquisition of US Oncology. Excluding these charges (credit), operating expenses in 2010 approximated the same period a year ago primarily due to lower PSIP expenses and the sale of two businesses during the first and third quarters of 2009. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives. Our litigation charges (credit) and PSIP expense are more fully described under the caption “Operating Expenses” in this Financial Review. Other income, net was $36 million, $43 million and $12 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In 2009, other income, net included a pre-tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million after-tax) on two equity-held investments and a pre-tax gain of $24 million ($14 million after tax) from the sale of an equity-held investment. Interest expense increased 19% to $222 million in 2011 and 30% to $187 million in 2010. Interest expense increased in 2011 primarily due to bridge loan fees incurred for our acquisition of US Oncology and interest expense associated with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt. These increases were partially offset by the repayment of $215 million of long-term debt in March 2010. Interest expense increased in 2010 primarily due to our issuance of $700 million of long-term debt in February 2009. Our reported income tax rates were 30.9%, 32.2% and 22.7% in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In 2011, income tax expense included $34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items which primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. In 2009, current income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which $87 million represents a non-cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. Net income was $1,202 million, $1,263 million and $823 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, and diluted earnings per common share were $4.57, $4.62, and $2.95. Diluted earnings per common share were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years. Net income for 2011 includes a $72 million after-tax gain (or $0.28 per diluted share) on the sale of our Technology Solutions segment’s wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Asia Pacific Pty Limited (“MAP”), which was sold in July 2010. Historical financial results for this subsidiary were not material. 29 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Revenues: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Distribution Solutions Direct distribution & services $ 77,554 $ 72,210 $ 66,876 Sales to customers’ warehouses 18,631 21,435 25,809 Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution & services 96,185 93,645 92,685 Canada pharmaceutical distribution & services 9,784 9,072 8,225 Medical-Surgical distribution & services 2,920 2,861 2,658 Total Distribution Solutions 108,889 105,578 103,568 Technology Solutions Services 2,483 2,439 2,337 Software & software systems 590 571 572 Hardware 122 114 155 Total Technology Solutions 3,195 3,124 3,064 Total Revenues $ 112,084 $ 108,702 $ 106,632 Revenues increased 3% to $112.1 billion in 2011 and 2% to $108.7 billion in 2010. The increase in revenues primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth, which includes price increases and increased volume from new and existing customers, the effect of a shift from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery, the lapsing of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011, and due to our acquisition of US Oncology. These increases were partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery and market growth, partially offset by greater sales of lower priced generic drugs and the loss of several customers in late 2009. Revenues for 2010 benefited to a lesser extent from an increase in demand associated with the flu season. Sales to customers’ warehouses for 2011 decreased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting reduced revenues associated with existing customers, the effect of a shift of revenues to direct store delivery, the lapsing of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011, and the impact of brand to generic conversions. Sales to customers’ warehouses for 2010 decreased compared to 2009 primarily due to a shift of revenues to direct store delivery, reduced revenues associated with a large customer and the loss of a large customer in mid-2009, partially offset by expanded business with existing customers. Sales to retail customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large self-warehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer) directly to our customers’ warehouses. This distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the Company as a stand-alone service; rather, it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal self-warehousing distribution network. Sales to customers’ warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the Company as one source for both their direct-to-store business and their warehouse business. We generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers’ warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low cost-to-serve model on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars. 30 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) The customer mix of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution revenues was as follows: Years Ended March 31, 2011 2010 2009 Direct Sales Independents 12 % 12 % 13 % Institutions 34 32 32 Retail Chains 33 32 26 Subtotal 79 76 71 Sales to retail customers’ warehouses 21 24 29 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % As previously described, a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both our direct and warehouse distribution methods, the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low cost-to-serve model. When evaluating and pricing customer contracts, we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability. As a result, we do not evaluate our performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers’ warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to a change in the foreign currency exchange rate of 7%. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 1% in 2011. Canadian revenues for 2011 increased due to market growth, offset by a government-imposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces and brand to generic conversions. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to market growth and a favorable change in the foreign currency exchange rate of 3%. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased by 7% in 2010. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth, partially offset by the decrease in demand associated with the flu season. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting an increase in demand related to the flu season, acquisitions and increased volume from new and existing customers. Technology Solutions revenues increased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers, increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products and growth in our outsourcing services, partially offset by the sale of MAP in July 2010. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher services revenues associated with increases in outsourcing revenues for claims processing and other services and software maintenance reflecting the segment’s expanded customer base. These increases were partially offset by a shift to products that have higher software revenue deferral rates and lower hardware sales. 31 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Gross Profit Distribution Solutions (1) $ 4,565 $ 4,219 $ 3,955 Technology Solutions (2) 1,405 1,457 1,423 Total $ 5,970 $ 5,676 $ 5,378 Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions 4.19 % 4.00 % 3.82 % Technology Solutions 43.97 46.64 46.44 Total 5.33 5.22 5.04 (1) Gross profit of our Distribution Solutions segment for 2011 includes a credit of $51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer, which was recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. (2) Gross profit of our Technology Solutions segment for 2011 includes a $72 million asset impairment charge for capitalized software held for sale. Gross profit increased 5% to $6.0 billion in 2011 and 6% to $5.7 billion in 2010. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 11 bp in 2011 and 18 bp in 2010. Gross profit margin increased in 2011 primarily reflecting higher gross profit margin from our Distribution Solutions segment and increased in 2010 primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues in both of our operating segments. In 2011, our Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting higher buy margin, increased sales of higher margin generic drugs and due to our acquisition of US Oncology, partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and a decrease in sell margin. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our Distribution Solutions segment’s 2011 gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a credit of $51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit. In 2010, our Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to an improved mix of higher margin revenues stemming from increased flu-related demand across our distribution businesses. Gross profit margin was also favorably affected by a higher buy margin and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in sell margin. Our last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) net inventory expense was $3 million in 2011 and $8 million for 2010 and 2009. Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The practice in the Distribution Solutions segment’s distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those years. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” included in this Financial Review. 32 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2011, our Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin decreased compared to 2010 primarily due to a $72 million asset impairment charge, the sale of MAP and continued investment in our clinical and enterprise revenue management solutions products. These decreases were partially offset by a shift to higher margin revenue. In 2010, our Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased compared to 2009 primarily due to a favorable change in revenue mix, partially offset by a higher software revenue deferral rate. Our capitalized software held for sale is amortized over three years. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. In October 2010, we decreased our estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our Horizon Enterprise Revenue ManagementTM (“HzERM”) software product and as a result, concluded that the estimated future revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a $72 million non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011 within our Technology Solutions segment’s cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of the software product to its net realizable value. Operating Expenses: Years Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Operating Expenses Distribution Solutions (1) $ 2,673 $ 2,260 $ 2,777 Technology Solutions 1,108 1,077 1,096 Corporate 368 351 309 Subtotal 4,149 3,688 4,182 Litigation (credit), net — (20 ) — Total $ 4,149 $ 3,668 $ 4,182 Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Revenues Distribution Solutions 2.45 % 2.14 % 2.68 % Technology Solutions 34.68 34.48 35.77 Total 3.70 3.37 3.92 (1) Operating expenses for 2011 and 2009 include $213 million and $493 million of AWP litigation charges. Operating expenses increased 13% to $4.1 billion in 2011 and decreased 12% to $3.7 billion in 2010. Excluding the 2011, 2010 and 2009 litigation charges (credit) of $213 million, $(20) million and $493 million, operating expenses increased 7% in 2011 and remained flat in 2010. Excluding the litigation charges (credit), operating expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits including the McKesson Corporation Profit Sharing Investment Plan (“PSIP”) and the addition of US Oncology. Excluding the litigation charges (credit), operating expenses for 2010 approximated 2009 primarily due to lower PSIP expense, cost containment efforts and the sale of two businesses during 2009. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with employee compensation and benefit costs, our 2009 business acquisitions and other business initiatives. The McKesson Corporation PSIP was a member of the settlement class in the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. On April 27, 2009, the court issued an order approving the distribution of the settlement funds. On October 9, 2009, the PSIP received approximately $119 million of the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action proceeds. Approximately $42 million of the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP participants during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class-holding period and were allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010. Approximately $77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares (the “Unallocated Proceeds”) of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP in an employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) suspense account. In accordance with the plan terms, the PSIP distributed all of the Unallocated Proceeds to current PSIP participants after the close of the plan year in April 2010. The receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP was reimbursement for the loss in value of the Company’s common stock held by the PSIP in its ESOP suspense account during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class-holding period and was not a contribution made by the Company to the PSIP or ESOP. 33 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Accordingly, there were no accounting consequences to the Company’s financial statements relating to the receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP. As a result of the PSIP’s receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds, in 2010 the Company contributed $1 million to the PSIP. Accordingly, PSIP expense for 2010 was nominal. In 2011, the Company resumed its contributions to the PSIP. PSIP expense by segment for the last three years was as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Distribution Solutions $ 23 $ — $ 23 Technology Solutions 32 1 28 Corporate 4 — 2 PSIP expense $ 59 $ 1 $ 53 Cost of sales (1) $ 17 $ — $ 12 Operating expenses 42 1 41 PSIP expense $ 59 $ 1 $ 53 (1) Amounts recorded to cost of sales pertain solely to our McKesson Technology Solutions segment. On a segment basis, Distribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses increased in 2011 and decreased in 2010 primarily due to the AWP litigation charges of $213 million and $493 million in 2011 and 2009. Excluding the AWP charge, operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits including PSIP expenses and the addition of US Oncology. Operating expenses in 2011 also increased as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the AWP charge, Distribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the sale of two businesses during 2009, lower PSIP expense in 2010 and our continued focus on cost containment. These decreases were partially offset by increased expenses associated with our 2009 business acquisitions. As previously reported, in 2009 we reached an agreement to settle all private party claims relating to First DataBank, Inc.’s published drug reimbursement benchmarks for $350 million. We also recorded an accrual of $143 million for pending and expected AWP claims by public payers. The combination of the settlement for all AWP private party claims and the decision by us to establish an estimated accrual for the pending and expected AWP claims by public payers resulted in a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $493 million in the third quarter of 2009. In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $24 million for the settlement with the State of Connecticut relating to AWP claims. The settlement included an express denial of liability and a release by Connecticut of the Company as to all matters alleged or which could have been alleged in the action. A cash payment of $26 million was made in the third quarter of 2011 for this settlement. During the third quarter of 2011, following a review of the reserve for estimated probable losses from current and possible future public entity AWP claims, which review included consideration of the pace and progress of settlement discussions during and after the third quarter relating to state and federal Medicaid claims, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $189 million. All AWP litigation charges were included in our Distribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses. As of March 31, 2011, the reserve relating to AWP public entity claims was $330 million and was included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial Note 17, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. 34 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) As a result of our acquisition of US Oncology, we incurred a net $52 million of acquisition-related expenses as follows: Corporate & Distribution Interest (In millions) Solutions Expense Total Operating expenses: Transaction closing expenses $ 22 $ — $ 22 Severance and relocation 9 — 9 Other integration expenses 10 2 12 Total operating expenses 41 2 43 Other income: reimbursement of post-acquisition interest expense from former shareholders — (16 ) (16 ) Interest expense: bridge loan fees — 25 25 Total acquisition-related expenses $ 41 $ 11 $ 52 We anticipate incurring additional acquisition-related expenses in 2012 as we continue to integrate US Oncology. Technology Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 and decreased in 2010. The growth in 2011 reflects our increased investment in research and development activities and higher employee compensation and benefit costs, which includes PSIP expense, partially offset by the sale of MAP in the second quarter of 2011. Operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2010 benefited from lower PSIP expense, cost containment efforts and reduction in workforce plans implemented in 2009, partially offset by our continued investment in research and development activities. Corporate expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs and an asset impairment charge for certain tangible property, partially offset by lower fees associated with our accounts receivable facility. As a result of our adoption of a new accounting standard for transfers of financial assets on April 1, 2010, fees associated with our accounts receivable sales facility are now recorded in interest expense. Prior to 2011, these fees were recorded in Corporate administrative expenses. Corporate expenses for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs, other business initiatives and legal settlement charges. In 2010, we recorded net credits of $20 million relating to settlements for the securities litigation, which were recorded in Corporate expenses. Other Income, net: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 By Segment Distribution Solutions $ 5 $ 29 $ (20 ) Technology Solutions 4 5 7 Corporate 27 9 25 Total $ 36 $ 43 $ 12 In 2011, other income, net included a credit of $16 million representing the reimbursement of post-acquisition interest expense by the former shareholders of US Oncology, which is recorded in Corporate. Interest income was $18 million, $16 million and $31 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In 2010, other income, net included a $17 million pre-tax gain ($14 million after-tax) from the sale of our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions, LLC (“MLS”). The gain on sale of our investment in MLS was recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates. 35 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2009, other income, net included a pre-tax impairment charge of $63 million ($60 million after-tax) on two equity-held investments (as further described below) and a pre-tax gain of $24 million ($14 million after-tax) from the sale of our 42% equity interest in Verispan, LLC (“Verispan”). The impairment charge and the gain on sale of our investment in Verispan were both recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. We evaluate our investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. In 2009, we determined that the fair value of our interest in Parata Systems, LLC (“Parata”) was lower than its carrying value and that such impairment was other-than-temporary. Fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results and market capitalization rates. We determined the impairment was other-than-temporary based on our assessment of all relevant factors including deterioration in the investee’s financial condition and weak market conditions. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax impairment of $58 million ($55 million after-tax) on this investment which is recorded as other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment. Our investment in Parata is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In 2009, we also recorded a pre-tax impairment of $5 million ($5 million after-tax) on another equity-held investment within our Distribution Solutions segment.

(2) Operating expenses for 2011 and 2009 for our Distribution Solutions segment included $213 million and $493 million of AWP litigation charges. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, including a $213 million AWP litigation charge, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin, which included a $51 million antitrust settlement. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a higher gross profit margin, lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and higher other income. Results for 2010 included the $17 million gain on sale of MLS. Results for 2009 included the $493 million AWP litigation charge, $63 million of charges to write-down two equity-held investments and a $24 million gain on the sale of the segment’s 42% equity investment in Verispan. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflecting a decrease in gross profit margin, which included the $72 million asset impairment charge and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and an improvement in gross profit margin. 36 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Corporate expenses, net of other income were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses which were fully offset by an increase in other income, including the $16 million benefit associated with the reimbursement of post-acquisition interest expense by the former shareholders of US Oncology. Corporate expenses, net of other income increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in interest income. Interest Expense: Interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to $25 million of bridge loan fees related to the acquisition of US Oncology, interest expense associated with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt and fees from our accounts receivable sales facility which are recorded in interest expense commencing in 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of $215 million of our long-term debt in March 2010. Interest expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to our issuance of $700 million of long-term debt in February 2009. Refer to our discussion under the caption “Credit Resources” within this Financial Review for additional information regarding our financing activities. Income Taxes: Our reported tax rates were 30.9%, 32.2% and 22.7% in 2011, 2010 and 2009. In addition to the items noted below, fluctuations in our reported tax rate are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In 2011, income tax expense included $34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items, which primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. In 2009, income tax expense included $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items of which $87 million represents a non-cash benefit. These benefits primarily relate to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest. The recognition of these discrete items was primarily due to the lapsing of the statutes of limitations. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently examining our fiscal years 2003 through 2006 and we anticipate the field work will be completed and they will issue the Revenue Agent Report in our first quarter of fiscal 2012. We have received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for a total of $169 million related to transfer pricing for 2003 through 2007. Payments of most of the assessments to the CRA have been made to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2007. If we are not successful in resolving these issues with the CRA, a trial date has been set for October 17, 2011 with the Tax Court of Canada. We believe that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to the IRS and CRA examinations. However, the final resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense. Discontinued Operation: In July 2010, our Technology Solutions segment sold MAP, a provider of phone and web-based healthcare services in Australia and New Zealand, for net sales proceeds of $109 million. The divestiture generated a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $95 million and $72 million. As a result of the sale, we were able to utilize capital loss carry-forwards for which we previously recorded a valuation allowance of $15 million. The release of the valuation allowance is included as a tax benefit in our after-tax gain on the divestiture. The after-tax gain on disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations in 2011. The historical financial operating results and net assets of MAP were not material to our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Net Income: Net income was $1,202 million, $1,263 million and $823 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009 and diluted earnings per common share were $4.57, $4.62 and $2.95. The net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2011 included a pre-tax charge of $213 million ($149 million after-tax). Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2011 also included an after-tax gain of $72 million (or $0.28 per diluted share) relating to our sale of MAP. The net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2009 included a pre-tax charge of $493 million ($311 million after-tax) for the AWP litigation. 37 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 263 million, 273 million and 279 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009. The decrease in the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding over the past two years primarily reflects a decrease in the number of shares outstanding as a result of stock repurchased, partially offset by the exercise/settlement of share-based awards. International Operations International operations accounted for 8.9%, 8.6% and 7.9% of 2011, 2010 and 2009 consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our international operations is also included in Financial Note 20, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Business Combinations On December 30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Oncology for approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of cash consideration of $0.2 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of liabilities with a fair value of $1.9 billion. As an integrated oncology company, US Oncology is affiliated with community-based oncologists, and works with patients, hospitals, payers and the medical industry across all phases of the cancer research and delivery continuum. The acquisition of US Oncology expands our existing specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and adds practice management services for oncologists. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand. Included in the purchase price allocation are acquired identifiable intangibles of $1.0 billion, which primarily consist of $0.7 billion of service agreements and $0.2 billion of customer lists. The estimated weighted average lives of the service agreements, customer lists and total acquired intangibles are 18 years, 10 years and 16 years. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $808 million was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business. Due to the recent timing of the acquisition, the fair value measurements of assets and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date are subject to change within the measurement period as our fair value assessments are finalized. Financial results for US Oncology have been included in the results of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. On May 21, 2008, we acquired McQueary Brothers of Springfield, Missouri for approximately $190 million. McQueary Brothers is a regional distributor of pharmaceutical, health and beauty products to independent and regional chain pharmacies in the Midwestern U.S. This acquisition expanded our existing U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand. Financial results for McQueary Brothers have been included within our Distribution Solutions segment since the date of acquisition. During the first quarter of 2010, the fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were completed. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $126 million was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflected the expected future benefits from synergies to be realized upon integrating the business. Included in the purchase price allocation were acquired identifiable intangibles of $61 million primarily representing a customer relationship with a useful life of 7 years, a trade name of $2 million with a useful life of less than one year and a not-to-compete agreement of $4 million with a useful life of 4 years. During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. 38 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 11, “Business Combinations” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 2012 Outlook Information regarding the Company’s 2012 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 3, 2011. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 — Business — Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A — Risk Factors in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 39 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2011, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our two largest customers, CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”) and Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid”), accounted for approximately 14% and 11% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2011, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 43% of total accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”) and Rite Aid were approximately 13%, 10% and 9% of total accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2011 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue. At March 31, 2011, trade and notes receivables were $8,108 million prior to allowances of $124 million. In 2011, 2010 and 2009 our provision for bad debts was $18 million, $17 million and $29 million. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.5% and 1.8%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2011 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $8 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 40 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method and the cost of Canadian inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost determined by the standard cost method. Rebates, fees, cash discounts, allowances, chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $9.2 billion and $9.4 billion at March 31, 2011 and 2010. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 87% of our inventories at March 31, 2011 and 2010. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $96 million and $93 million. LIFO reserves include both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized net LIFO expense of $3 million, $8 million and $8 million within our consolidated statements of operations. In 2011, our $3 million net LIFO expense related to our non-pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the FIFO inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or inventory as valued under FIFO. Primarily due to continued net deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $156 million and $112 million higher than FIFO as of March 31, 2011 and 2010. As a result, in 2011 and 2010, we recorded LCM charges of $44 million and $5 million within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market. As deflation in generic pharmaceuticals continues, we anticipate that LIFO credits from the valuation of our pharmaceutical products will be fully offset by LCM reserves. In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We provide reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, if indicated, as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Effective April 1, 2009, acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combinations and are expensed as incurred. Acquisition-related expenses totaled $52 million in 2011 and were not material in 2010. Several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset or liability acquired. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. 41 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Goodwill: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $4,364 million and $3,568 million of goodwill at March 31, 2011 and 2010. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit. Management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing. Impairment tests require that we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, a second step would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment, which would be recorded as a charge in our consolidated statements of operations. Fair values can be determined using the market, income or cost approach. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. The judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Supplier Incentives: Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory. 42 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, supplier reserves were $102 million and $89 million. The ultimate outcome of any amounts due from our suppliers may be different from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2011 and 2010 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2011 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $14 million in 2011. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,297 million and $1,187 million at March 31, 2011 and 2010 and deferred tax liabilities of $2,261 million and $1,845 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and other assets. We established valuation allowances of $99 million against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to federal, state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $16 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for 2011. Share-Based Compensation: Our compensation programs include share-based compensation. We account for all share-based compensation transactions using a fair-value based measurement method. The share-based compensation expense is recognized, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions. For awards with performance conditions and multiple vest dates, we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis. For awards with performance conditions and a single vest date, we recognize the expense on a straight-line basis. 43 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) We estimate the grant-date fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. We believe that it is difficult to accurately measure the value of an employee stock option. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process, among others, are the expected life of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor and the expected dividend yield. In determining the expected life of the option, we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns. We use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor. We believe that this market-based input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations. Once the fair values of employee stock options are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual experience. In addition, we develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards, which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on share-based compensation expense. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. We re-assess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period. Such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures. As required, the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates. Our assessments of estimated share-based compensation charges are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These variables include the volatility of our stock price, employee stock option exercise behavior, timing, number and types of annual share-based awards and the attainment of performance goals. As a result, the future share-based compensation expense may differ from the Company’s historical amounts. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and short-term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, from time-to-time, we may access the long-term debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities. 44 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,338 million in 2011 compared to $2,316 million in 2010 and $1,351 million in 2009. Operating activities for 2011 included a non-cash charge of $213 million and the related income tax benefit of $64 million for the AWP litigation charge. Operating activities for 2011 also reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with revenue growth, partially offset by improved management of inventories and longer payment terms for certain purchases. Cash flows from operations can also be significantly affected by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the AWP litigation private payer settlement payments of $350 million. Operating activities for 2009 included a non-cash charge of $493 million and the related income tax benefit of $182 million for the AWP litigation charge. Operating activities for 2009 also reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth as well as longer payment terms for certain customers and improvement in our net financial inventory (inventory, net of drafts and accounts payable). Net cash used in investing activities was $624 million in 2011 compared to $309 million in 2010 and $727 million in 2009. Investing activities for 2011 included $292 million of cash payments for business acquisitions, including approximately $244 million for our acquisition of US Oncology, and $109 million of cash received from the sale of MAP. Investing activities in 2011 also included $233 million and $155 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2010 included $199 million and $179 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software and the release of $55 million of restricted cash from escrow related to the AWP private litigation settlement payments. Investing activities for 2009 included $358 million of cash payments for business acquisitions, including the McQueary Brothers acquisition for approximately $190 million. Financing activities utilized cash of $1,841 million in 2011 and $421 million in 2010, and provided cash of $178 million in 2009. Financing activities for 2011 reflect $1,689 million of cash received from the issuance of long-term debt. In February 2011 we issued $600 million of 3.25% notes due 2016, $600 million of 4.75% notes due 2021, and $500 million of 6.00% notes due 2041. Net proceeds from the issuance of the long-term notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used to pay off the $1,730 million of debt assumed as part of the acquisition of US Oncology. Also as part of our acquisition of US Oncology, we borrowed $1,000 million for bridge financing which was fully repaid by February 2011. Financing activities for 2011 also included $2,050 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $171 million of dividends paid and $367 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2010 included $323 million in cash paid for share repurchases and $218 million in cash paid on our long-term debt, which primarily consisted of $215 million paid on the maturity of our 9.13% Series C Senior Notes in March 2010. Financing activities for 2010 also included $323 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $131 million of dividends paid and $212 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2009 included our February 2009 issuance of $350 million of 6.50% notes due 2014 and $350 million of 7.50% notes due 2019. Net proceeds of $693 million from the issuance of the notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used by the Company for general corporate purposes. Financing activities for 2009 also included $502 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $116 million of dividends paid and $97 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options. The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. As of March 31, 2011, $500 million remained available for future repurchases under the October 2010 Board approved share repurchase plan. In April 2011, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. 45 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In July 2008, the Board authorized the retirement of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be repurchased from time-to-time pursuant to its stock repurchase program. During the second quarter of 2009, all of the 4 million repurchased shares, which we purchased for $204 million, were formally retired by the Company. The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. As such, $165 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,612 $ 3,731 $ 2,109 Working capital 3,631 4,492 3,065 Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents 392 (1,434 ) 403 Debt to capital ratio (1) 35.7 % 23.4 % 28.9 % Net debt to net capital employed (2) 5.1 % (23.5 )% 6.1 % Return on stockholders’ equity (3) 16.9 % 18.7 % 13.2 % (1) Ratio is computed as total debt divided by total debt and stockholders’ equity. (2) Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (“net debt”), divided by net debt and stockholders’ equity (“net capital employed”). (3) Ratio is computed as net income, divided by a five-quarter average of stockholders’ equity. Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2011, included approximately $1.8 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our intent is to utilize this cash in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. During the fourth quarter of 2011 and pursuant to IRS regulations, we temporarily borrowed and repaid $1.0 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside the United States. The duration of this temporary loan to the United States was less than 60 days. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and customer requirements. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2011 compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payables, accrued liabilities and the current portion of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in receivables. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2010 compared to March 31, 2009, primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in net financial inventory and repayment of $215 million of our long-term debt in March 2010. 46 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2011, compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in total debt as a result of the US Oncology acquisition. This ratio decreased at March 31, 2010, compared to March 31, 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents and repayment of $215 million of our long-term debt in March 2010. The Company paid quarterly cash dividends at the rate of $0.06 per share on its common stock from the fourth quarter of 1999 through the fourth quarter of 2008. In April 2008, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.06 to $0.12 per share and in May 2010, the quarterly dividend was raised to $0.18 per common share. In April 2011, the Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share, applicable to ensuing quarterly dividend declarations. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid total cash dividends of $171 million, $131 million and $116 million. Contractual Obligations: The table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2011: Years (In millions) Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5 On balance sheet Long-term debt (1) $ 4,004 $ 417 $ 861 $ 606 $ 2,120 Other (2) 413 32 83 162 136 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3) 2,012 224 361 293 1,134 Purchase obligations (4) 3,730 3,610 89 31 — Operating lease obligations (5) 844 178 258 167 241 Customer guarantees (6) 176 119 24 5 28 Total $ 11,179 $ 4,580 $ 1,676 $ 1,264 $ 3,659 (1) Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations. (2) Represents our estimated benefit payments for the unfunded benefit plans and minimum funding requirements for the pension plans. (3) Primarily represents interest that will become due on our fixed rate long-term debt obligations. (4) A purchase obligation is defined as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases, capital commitments and service agreements. (5) Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases. (6) Represents primarily agreements with certain of our Canadian customers’ financial institutions under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory or our customers’ debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions. We also have an agreement with one software customer that, under limited circumstances, may require us to secure standby financing. Because the amount of the standby financing is not explicitly stated, the overall amount of this guarantee cannot reasonably be estimated. At March 31, 2011, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and customers’ debt guarantees were $138 million and $38 million, none of which had been accrued. At March 31, 2011, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $485 million. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. 47 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In addition, at March 31, 2011, our banks and insurance companies have issued $128 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs. Credit Resources: We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, our accounts receivable sales facility, short-term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper. Senior Bridge Term Loan Facility In connection with our execution of an agreement to acquire US Oncology, in November 2010, we entered into a $2.0 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (“Bridge Loan”). In December 2010, we reduced the Bridge Loan commitment to $1.0 billion. On January 31, 2011, we borrowed $1.0 billion under the Bridge Loan. On February 28, 2011, we repaid the funds obtained under the Bridge Loan with long-term debt, as further described below, and the Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement was terminated. During the time it was outstanding, the Bridge Loan bore interest of 1.76%, which was based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s credit rating. Bridge Loan fees of $25 million were included in Corporate interest expense. US Oncology Debt Acquired Upon our purchase of US Oncology in December 2010, we assumed the outstanding debt of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary US Oncology, Inc. Immediately prior to our acquisition, US Oncology Holdings, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding Senior Unsecured Floating Rate Toggle Notes due 2012, and US Oncology, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 and 10.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we paid interest of $50 million and redeemed these notes, including the remaining accrued interest, for $1,738 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our Bridge Loan. Long-Term Debt On February 28, 2011, we issued 3.25% notes due March 1, 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, 4.75% notes due March 1, 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million and 6.00% notes due March 1, 2041 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on September 1, 2011. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $1,673 million from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the Bridge Loan. On February 12, 2009, we issued 6.50% notes due February 15, 2014, in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million and 7.50% notes due February 15, 2019, in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $693 million from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes. In March 2010, we repaid our $215 million 9.13% Series C Senior notes, which had matured. Accounts Receivable Sales Facility In May 2010, we renewed our accounts receivable sales facility (the “Facility”) for an additional one year period under terms substantially similar to those previously in place, and in doing so we increased our committed balance from $1.1 billion to $1.35 billion. From time-to-time, the available amount of the Facility may be less than $1.35 billion based on accounts receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements. The renewed Facility will expire in May 2011. We anticipate renewing this Facility before its expiration. At March 31, 2011, there were no securitized accounts receivable balances or secured borrowings outstanding under the Facility. As of March 31, 2010, there were no accounts receivable sold under the Facility. Additionally, there were no sales of interests to third-party purchaser groups in the year ended March 31, 2011. 48 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in Financial Notes 1 and 11, “Significant Accounting Policies” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revolving Credit Facility We have a syndicated $1.3 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in June 2012. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest based upon either a Prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate. There were no borrowings under this facility in 2011 and 2010 and $279 million for 2009. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no amounts outstanding under this facility. Commercial Paper There were no commercial paper issuances during 2011 and 2010 and no amount outstanding at March 31, 2011 and 2010. We issued and repaid $3.3 billion of commercial paper in 2009. Debt Covenant Our various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 56.5%. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2011, this ratio was 35.7% and we were in compliance with our other financial covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings, or the lack of compliance with our covenants, could negatively impact our ability to finance operations or issue additional debt at acceptable interest rates. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 19, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS New accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 49 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2011, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. Should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2011, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $17 million. The selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. As of March 31, 2011 and 2010, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $4.3 billion and $2.5 billion. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. Foreign exchange risk: We derive revenues and earnings from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries, Israel and Mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. As of March 31, 2011, a hypothetical adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 50 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:25.900662

GENERAL Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, referred to as the Financial Review, is intended to assist the reader in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial position of the Company together with its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company’s fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the Company’s fiscal year. Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 – Business – Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A – Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We conduct our business through two operating segments: McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions. See Financial Note 22, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of these segments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview: Years Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions, except per share data) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Revenues $ 122,734 $ 112,084 $ 108,702 10% 3% Gross Profit $ 6,567 $ 5,970 $ 5,676 10% 5% Operating Expenses 4,269 3,936 3,688 8 7 Litigation Charges (Credit), Net 149 213 (20) (30) — Total Operating Expenses 4,418 4,149 3,668 6 13 Other Income, Net 21 36 43 (42) (16) Interest Expense (251) (222) (187) 13 19 Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 1,919 1,635 1,864 17 (12) Income Tax Expense (516) (505) (601) 2 (16) Income from Continuing Operations 1,403 1,130 1,263 24 (11) Discontinued Operation – gain on sale, net of tax — 72 — — — Net Income $ 1,403 $ 1,202 $ 1,263 17 (5) Diluted Earnings Per Common Share Continuing Operations $ 5.59 $ 4.29 $ 4.62 30% (7)% Discontinued Operation — 0.28 — — — Total $ 5.59 $ 4.57 $ 4.62 22 (1) Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares 251 263 273 (5)% (4)% Revenues increased over each of the last two years primarily reflecting market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. Additionally, revenues for 2012 and 2011 benefited from our December 30, 2010 acquisition of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. (“US Oncology”). 28 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross profit and gross profit margin increased over each of the last two years. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 2 basis points (“bp”) to 5.35% in 2012 and 11 bp to 5.33% in 2011. Gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the addition of US Oncology, higher generics income in our Distribution Solutions segment and an increase in higher margin revenues in our Technology Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sell margin and by a $51 million benefit in 2011 associated with the receipt of our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer in our Distribution Solutions segment. Gross profit margin increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in buy margin, higher generics income and the receipt of $51 million from an antitrust class action settlement in our Distribution Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our Technology Solutions segment margin, which included a $72 million asset impairment charge. Operating expenses increased over each of the last two years primarily reflecting an increase in expenses associated with supporting our higher revenues, the addition of US Oncology, and higher employee compensation and benefits costs, which includes expenses associated with our Profit Sharing Investment Plan (“PSIP”). Operating expenses were also impacted by Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) litigation charges of $149 million and $213 million in 2012 and 2011. Our litigation charges and PSIP expense are more fully described under the caption “Operating Expenses” in this Financial Review. Other income, net was $21 million, $36 million and $43 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010. In 2011, other income, net includes the receipt of $16 million representing the reimbursement of post-acquisition interest expense by the former shareholders of US Oncology. In 2010, other income, net includes a $17 million pre-tax gain ($14 million after-tax) from the sale of our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions, LLC (“MLS”). Interest expense increased over each of the last two years primarily due to the assumption of US Oncology’s debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt, which includes $25 million of bridge loan financing fees incurred in 2011. Additionally, 2011 interest expense benefited from repayment of $215 million of long-term debt in March 2010. Our reported income tax rates were 26.9%, 30.9% and 32.2% in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In addition, in 2012, 2011 and 2010, income tax expense includes $66 million, $34 million and $7 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items, which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. Included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit, is a $31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our AWP litigation. Net income was $1,403 million, $1,202 million and $1,263 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, and diluted earnings per common share were $5.59, $4.57 and $4.62. Net income for 2012 and 2011 includes after-tax AWP litigation charges of $60 million and $149 million. Additionally, net income for 2011 includes a $72 million after-tax gain (or $0.28 per diluted share) on the sale of our Technology Solutions segment’s wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Asia Pacific Pty Limited (“MAP”), which was sold in July 2010. Historical financial results for this subsidiary were not material. Diluted earnings per common share were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding decreased over each of the last two years due to our share repurchases. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, we repurchased 20 million, 29 million and 8 million of our common shares. 29 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Revenues: Years Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Distribution Solutions Direct distribution & services $ 85,523 $ 77,554 $ 72,210 10% 7% Sales to customers’ warehouses 20,453 18,631 21,435 10 (13) Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution & services 105,976 96,185 93,645 10 3 Canada pharmaceutical distribution & services 10,303 9,784 9,072 5 8 Medical-Surgical distribution & services 3,145 2,920 2,861 8 2 Total Distribution Solutions 119,424 108,889 105,578 10 3 Technology Solutions Services 2,594 2,483 2,439 4 2 Software & software systems 596 590 571 1 3 Hardware 120 122 114 (2) 7 Total Technology Solutions 3,310 3,195 3,124 4 2 Total Revenues $ 122,734 $ 112,084 $ 108,702 10 3 Revenues increased 10% to $122.7 billion in 2012 and 3% to $112.1 billion in 2011. The increase in revenues in each year primarily reflects market growth in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues, and our acquisition of US Oncology. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to market growth, which includes growing drug utilization and price increases, and from our acquisition of US Oncology. These increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth, the effect of a shift of revenues from sales to customers’ warehouses to direct store delivery, the lapping of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011, and due to our acquisition of US Oncology. These increases were partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and the impact of price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Sales to customers’ warehouses for 2012 increased compared to 2011 primarily due to a new customer and new business with existing customers. Sales to customers’ warehouses for 2011 decreased compared to 2010 primarily reflecting reduced revenues associated with existing customers, the effect of a shift of revenues to direct store delivery, the lapping of which was completed in the third quarter of 2011, and the impact of price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Sales to retail customers’ warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large self-warehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer) directly to our customers’ warehouses. This distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the Company as a stand-alone service; rather, it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal self-warehousing distribution network. Sales to customers’ warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the Company as one source for both their direct-to-store business and their warehouse business. We generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers’ warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low cost-to-serve model on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars. 30 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) The customer mix of revenues from our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business was as follows: Years Ended March 31, 2012 2011 2010 Direct Sales Retail Chains 34% 33% 32% Institutions 34 34 32 Independents 11 12 12 Subtotal 79 79 76 Sales to retail customers’ warehouses 21 21 24 Total 100% 100% 100% As previously described, a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both our direct and warehouse distribution methods, the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low cost-to-serve model. When evaluating and pricing customer contracts, we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability. As a result, we do not evaluate our performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers’ warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in 2012 compared to 2011. Excluding a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 2% during 2012, revenues increased primarily due to market growth, five additional sales days and a small acquisition in the second quarter of 2011, partially offset by government-imposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces. Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 8% in 2011 compared to 2010. Excluding a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 7% during 2011, revenues increased 1% in 2011. Canadian revenues for 2011 increased due to market growth, offset by a government-imposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces and the impact of price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to market growth, new customers and five additional sales days. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to market growth, partially offset by a decrease in demand associated with the flu season. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher revenues for claims processing, increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products, an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers and a number of small acquisitions made during 2012. Technology Solutions revenues increased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers, increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products and higher revenues for claims processing, partially offset by the sale of MAP in July 2010. Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Gross Profit Distribution Solutions (1) $ 5,057 $ 4,565 $ 4,219 11% 8% Technology Solutions (2) 1,510 1,405 1,457 7 (4) Total $ 6,567 $ 5,970 $ 5,676 10 5 Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions 4.23% 4.19% 4.00% 4bp 19bp Technology Solutions 45.62 43.97 46.64 165 (267) Total 5.35 5.33 5.22 2 11 (1) Gross profit of our Distribution Solutions segment for 2011 includes a credit of $51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer, which was recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. (2) Gross profit of our Technology Solutions segment for 2012 and 2011 includes a $31 million product alignment charge and a $72 million asset impairment charge for capitalized software held for sale. 31 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Gross profit increased 10% to $6.6 billion in 2012 and 5% to $6.0 billion in 2011. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 2 bp in 2012 and by 11 bp in 2011. Gross profit margin increased in 2012 primarily reflecting higher gross profit margins from both of our operating segments and increased in 2011 primarily reflecting higher gross profit margin from our Distribution Solutions segment. Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to our acquisition of US Oncology and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs, partially offset by a decline in sell margin and the receipt of $51 million in 2011 representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer. Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher buy margin, increased sales of higher margin generic drugs and due to our acquisition of US Oncology, partially offset by a decline in demand associated with the flu season and a decrease in sell margin. Our Distribution Solutions segment’s 2011 gross profit margin was also favorably affected by the receipt of $51 million representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) net inventory expense was $11 million in 2012, $3 million in 2011 and $8 million for 2010. Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The practice in the Distribution Solutions segment’s distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. Price declines on many generic pharmaceutical products in this segment over the last few years have moderated the effects of inflation in other product categories, which resulted in minimal overall price changes in those years. During 2012, we experienced a decline in deflationary trends in generic pharmaceuticals as a result of a reduction in generic product launches as compared to the prior year. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” included in this Financial Review. Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to an increase in higher margin revenues, a $72 million asset impairment charge related to our Horizon Enterprise ManagementTM (“HzERM”) software product in 2011 and lower amortization expense related to HzERM. These increases were partially offset by product alignment charges of $31 million in 2012. Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a $72 million asset impairment charge related to HzERM, the sale of MAP and continued investment in our clinical and enterprise revenue management solutions products, partially offset by a shift to higher margin revenue. During the third quarter of 2012, we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within our Technology Solutions segment. As part of this alignment strategy, we will be converging our core clinical and revenue cycle Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon’s Microsoft®–based platform over time. Additionally, we have stopped development of our HzERM software product. The plan resulted in a pre-tax charge of $51 million in 2012, of which $31 million was recorded to cost of sales and $20 million was recorded to operating expenses within our Technology Solutions segment. The majority of these charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2012. The pre-tax charge includes $24 million of non-cash asset impairment charges, primarily for the write-off of prepaid licenses and commissions and capitalized internal use software that were determined to be obsolete as they would not be utilized going forward, $10 million for severance, $7 million for customer allowances and $10 million for other charges. 32 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Our capitalized software held for sale is amortized over three years. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. At the end of the second quarter of 2010, our HzERM software product became generally available. In October 2010, we decreased our estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our HzERM software product and, as a result, concluded that the estimated future revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a $72 million non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011 within our Technology Solutions segment’s cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of the software product to its net realizable value.

Operating expenses increased 6% to $4.4 billion in 2012 and 13% to $4.1 billion in 2011. Operating expenses include pre-tax charges of $149 million and $213 million in 2012 and 2011 relating to our AWP litigation and a pre-tax credit of $20 million in 2010 relating to our securities litigation matter. Operating expenses increased in 2012 primarily due to the addition of US Oncology, higher employee compensation and benefits costs and an increase in expenses associated with supporting higher revenues, partially offset by a lower AWP litigation charge. Operating expenses increased in 2011 primarily due to the AWP litigation charge, higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits, including our Profit Sharing Investment Plan (“PSIP”), and the acquisition of US Oncology. The McKesson Corporation PSIP was a member of the settlement class in the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action. On April 27, 2009, the court issued an order approving the distribution of the settlement funds. On October 9, 2009, the PSIP received approximately $119 million of the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action proceeds. Approximately $42 million of the proceeds were attributable to the allocated shares of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP participants during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class-holding period and were allocated to the respective participants on that basis in the third quarter of 2010. Approximately $77 million of the proceeds were attributable to the unallocated shares (the “Unallocated Proceeds”) of McKesson common stock owned by the PSIP in an employee stock ownership plan (“ESOP”) suspense account. In accordance with the plan terms, the PSIP distributed all of the Unallocated Proceeds to current PSIP participants after the close of the plan year in April 2010. The receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP was reimbursement for the loss in value of the Company’s common stock held by the PSIP in its ESOP suspense account during the Consolidated Securities Litigation Action class-holding period and was not a contribution made by the Company to the PSIP or ESOP. Accordingly, there were no accounting consequences to the Company’s financial statements relating to the receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds by the PSIP. As a result of the PSIP’s receipt of the Unallocated Proceeds, in 2010 the Company contributed $1 million to the PSIP. Accordingly, PSIP expense for 2010 was nominal. Commencing in 2011, the Company resumed its contributions to the PSIP. 33 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) PSIP expense by segment for the last three years was as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Distribution Solutions $ 22 $ 23 $ — Technology Solutions 30 32 1 Corporate 6 4 — PSIP expense $ 58 $ 59 $ 1 Cost of sales (1) $ 17 $ 17 $ — Operating expenses 41 42 1 PSIP expense $ 58 $ 59 $ 1 (1) Amounts recorded to cost of sales pertain solely to our McKesson Technology Solutions segment. Acquisition-related expenses were primarily incurred in 2012 and 2011 to acquire and integrate US Oncology. Acquisition-related expenses are generally recorded within operating expenses. In 2011, we incurred $25 million of bridge loan fees in connection with our acquisition of US Oncology, which were accounted as interest expense in Corporate, and we received reimbursement of post-acquisition interest expense from former shareholders of US Oncology of $16 million, which was accounted as other income.

Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to operating leverage, partially offset by the addition of US Oncology. Distribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the AWP litigation charge of $213 million in 2011, higher employee compensation and benefits expenses, including PSIP expenses, the addition of US Oncology and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company has a reserve relating to AWP public entity claims, which is reviewed at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate changes, including consideration of the pace and progress of discussions relating to potentially resolving other public entity claims. Pre-tax charges relating to changes in the Company’s AWP litigation reserve, including accrued interest, are recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment. The Company’s AWP litigation reserve is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In view of the number of outstanding cases and expected future claims, and the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserve. The following is the activity related to the AWP litigation reserve for the years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended March 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 AWP litigation reserve at beginning of period $ 330 $ 143 $ 143 Charges incurred 149 213 — Payments made (26) (26) — AWP litigation reserve at end of period $ 453 $ 330 $ 143 The charges for 2012 primarily related to the Douglas County, Kansas Action settlement and the state and federal Medicaid claims. The charges for 2011 primarily related to state and federal Medicaid claims. On April 3, 2012, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the United States Department of Justice to resolve the federal share of Medicaid claims related to AWP. The total settlement amount of $191 million, which includes interest, was paid on April 9, 2012. Refer to Financial Note 19, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Technology Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to continued investment in research and development activities, a number of small acquisitions in 2012 and a charge of $20 million for a product alignment plan. These increases were partially offset by cost containment efforts. Technology Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to our increased investment in research and development activities and higher employee compensation and benefit costs, which includes PSIP expense, partially offset by the sale of MAP in the second quarter of 2011. Corporate expenses for 2012 increased compared to 2011 primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits expenses and a charitable contribution. Corporate expenses for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs and an asset impairment charge for certain tangible property. These increases were partially offset by lower fees associated with our accounts receivable facility. As a result of our adoption of a new accounting standard for transfers of financial assets on April 1, 2010, fees associated with our accounts receivable sales facility are recorded in interest expense. Prior to 2011, these fees were recorded in Corporate administrative expenses. 35 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Other Income, Net: Years Ended March 31, Change (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 Other Income, Net Distribution Solutions $ 16 $ 5 $ 29 220% (83)% Technology Solutions 5 4 5 25 (20) Corporate — 27 9 (100) 200 Total $ 21 $ 36 $ 43 (42) (16) In 2011, other income, net included the receipt of $16 million representing the reimbursement of post-acquisition interest expense by the former shareholders of US Oncology, which is recorded in Corporate.

(2) Operating expenses for 2012 and 2011 for our Distribution Solutions segment included $149 million and $213 million of AWP litigation charges. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher gross profit margin, which included a full year of results from US Oncology, and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which included a lower AWP litigation charge. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, including a $213 million AWP litigation charge, partially offset by a higher gross profit margin, which included the receipt of $51 million representing our share of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflecting a decrease in gross profit margin, which included the $72 million asset impairment charge, and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. 36 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Corporate expenses, net of other income increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in other income. Corporate expenses, net of other income were flat in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses, which were offset by an increase in other income. Litigation Credit, Net: In 2010, we recorded a net credit of $20 million relating to settlements for a securities litigation. Interest Expense: Interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the $1.7 billion of long-term debt issued in February 2011 in connection with our acquisition of US Oncology. Interest expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to $25 million of bridge loan fees related to the acquisition of US Oncology, interest expense associated with the assumed debt and the subsequent refinancing of the debt, and fees from our accounts receivable sales facility, which are recorded in interest expense commencing in 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower interest expense due to the repayment of $215 million of our long-term debt in March 2010. Refer to our discussion under the caption “Credit Resources” within this Financial Review for additional information regarding our financing activities. Income Taxes: Our reported income tax rates were 26.9%, 30.9% and 32.2% in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In addition, in 2012, 2011 and 2010, income tax expense included $66 million, $34 million and $7 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items, which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. Included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit, is a $31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our AWP litigation. We have received tax assessments of $98 million from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) relating to 2003 through 2006. We disagree with a substantial portion of the tax assessments primarily relating to transfer pricing. We are pursuing administrative relief through the appeals process and an opening conference has been scheduled for May 15, 2012. We have received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for a total of $169 million related to transfer pricing for 2003 through 2007. Payments of most of the assessments to the CRA have been made to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2007. The trial between McKesson Canada Corporation and the CRA, argued in the Tax Court of Canada, concluded in early February 2012, and we are waiting for the decision. We continue to believe in the merits of our tax positions and that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to these examinations in our financial statements. However, the final resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense. Discontinued Operation: In July 2010, our Technology Solutions segment sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, MAP, a provider of phone and web-based healthcare services in Australia and New Zealand, for net sales proceeds of $109 million. The divestiture generated a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $95 million and $72 million. As a result of the sale, we were able to utilize capital loss carry-forwards for which we previously recorded a valuation allowance of $15 million. The release of the valuation allowance is included as a tax benefit in our after-tax gain on the divestiture. The after-tax gain on disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statement of operations in 2011. The historical financial operating results and net assets of MAP were not material to our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Net Income: Net income was $1,403 million, $1,202 million and $1,263 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010 and diluted earnings per common share were $5.59, $4.57 and $4.62. Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2012 and 2011 include after-tax AWP litigation charges of $60 million and $149 million, or $0.24 and $0.57 per diluted common share. Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2010 include an after-tax securities litigation credit of $12 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share. Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2011 also included an after-tax gain of $72 million, or $0.28 per diluted share relating to our sale of MAP. 37 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 251 million, 263 million and 273 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010. The decreases in the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding primarily reflect the cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years, partially offset by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards. International Operations International operations accounted for 8.6%, 8.9% and 8.6% of 2012, 2011 and 2010 consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our international operations is also included in Financial Note 22, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Business Combinations On December 30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Oncology for approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of cash consideration of $0.2 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of liabilities with a fair value of $1.9 billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand. As an integrated oncology company, US Oncology is affiliated with community-based oncologists, and works with patients, hospitals, payers and the medical industry across all phases of the cancer research and delivery continuum. The acquisition of US Oncology expands our existing specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and adds practice management services for oncologists. Financial results for US Oncology have been included in the results of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. On March 25, 2012, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Drug Trading Company Limited, the independent banner business of the Katz Group Canada Inc. (“Katz Group”), and Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc., the franchise business of the Katz Group (collectively, “Katz Assets”) for approximately $919 million, net of cash acquired. The total purchase price is subject to change due to working capital adjustments within 60 days of closing. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand. The acquisition of the assets from the Drug Trading Company Limited consists of a marketing and purchasing arm of more than 850 independently owned pharmacies in Canada. The acquisition of Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc. consists of the franchise business of providing services to more than 160 independent pharmacies in Canada. Financial results for this acquisition were not included in the results of operations for 2012 as they were not material. These results will be included in the results of operations within our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, beginning in the first quarter of 2013. In April 2012, we purchased the remaining 50% interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California, for total cash of $90 million. The cash paid was funded from cash on hand. We previously held a 50% ownership interest and are the primary tenant in this building. This transaction will be accounted for as a step acquisition, which requires that we re-measure our previously held 50% interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations. The re-measurement to fair value is anticipated to result in a pre-tax gain of approximately $75 million ($46 million after-tax). The pre-tax gain will be recorded within Corporate in the consolidated statements of operations during the quarter ending June 30, 2012. During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. 38 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 12, “Business Combinations” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 2013 Outlook Information regarding the Company’s 2013 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated April 30, 2012. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 – Business – Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A – Risk Factors in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 39 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2012, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our two largest customers, CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”) and Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid”), accounted for approximately 16% and 10% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2012, accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 49% of total accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Walmart”) and Rite Aid were approximately 17%, 10% and 9% of total accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2012 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue. At March 31, 2012, trade and notes receivables were $8,735 million prior to allowances of $111 million. In 2012, 2011 and 2010 our provision for bad debts was $30 million, $18 million and $17 million. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.3% and 1.5%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2012 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $9 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 40 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method and the cost of Canadian inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, fees, cash discounts, allowances, chargebacks and other incentives received from vendors are generally accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $10.1 billion and $9.2 billion at March 31, 2012 and 2011. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 88% and 87% of our inventories at March 31, 2012 and 2011. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $107 million and $96 million. LIFO reserves include both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recognized net LIFO expense of $11 million, $3 million and $8 million within our consolidated statements of operations, which related to our non-pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the average cost or FIFO inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. Primarily due to continued net deflation in generic pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $76 million and $156 million higher than market as of March 31, 2012 and 2011. As a result, we recorded a LCM credit of $80 million in 2012 and a LCM charge of $44 million in 2011 within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market. During 2012, we experienced a decline in deflationary trends in generic pharmaceuticals as a result of a reduction in generic product launches as compared to the prior year. In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories, which are considered excess and obsolete, as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. 41 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Goodwill: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $5,032 million and $4,364 million of goodwill at March 31, 2012 and 2011. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component – one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services and customers are aggregated as a single reporting unit. Management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing. Impairment tests require that we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of net assets for the reporting units. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If we decide that it is appropriate to perform a qualitative assessment and conclude that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform a quantitative assessment, the fair values can be determined using the market, income or cost approach. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair value. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. The judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Supplier Incentives: Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory. 42 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, supplier reserves were $115 million and $102 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2012 and 2011 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2012 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $16 million in 2012. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,335 million and $1,297 million at March 31, 2012 and 2011 and deferred tax liabilities of $2,495 million and $2,261 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of net loss and credit carryforwards and timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and other assets. We established valuation allowances of $101 million and $99 million for 2012 and 2011 against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to federal, state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $19 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for 2012. Share-Based Compensation: Our compensation programs include share-based compensation. We account for all share-based compensation transactions using a fair-value based measurement method. The share-based compensation expense, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for those awards with graded vesting and service conditions. For awards with performance conditions and multiple vest dates, we recognize the expense on a graded vesting basis. For awards with performance conditions and a single vest date, we recognize the expense on a straight-line basis. We estimate the grant-date fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the model. The key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process, among others, are the expected life of the option, the expected stock price volatility and the expected dividend yield. In determining the expected life of the option, we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns. We use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor. We believe that this market-based input provides a better estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations. Once the fair values of employee stock options are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual experience. 43 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In addition, we develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards, which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on share-based compensation expense. If the actual forfeiture rate materially differs from the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to revise the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase or decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. We re-assess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period. As required, the forfeiture estimates will be adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates. Our assessments of estimated share-based compensation charges are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These variables include the volatility of our stock price, employee stock option exercise behavior, timing, number and types of annual share-based awards and the attainment of performance goals. As a result, the future share-based compensation expense may differ from the Company’s historical amounts. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility and short-term borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, from time-to-time, we may access the long-term debt capital markets to discharge our other liabilities. Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,950 million in 2012 compared to $2,338 million in 2011 and $2,316 million in 2010. Operating activities for 2012 reflect an increase in drafts and accounts payable primarily associated with longer payment terms for certain purchases, partially offset by an increase in receivables and higher inventories primarily associated with revenue growth. Operating activities for 2011 reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with revenue growth, partially offset by improved management of inventories and longer payment terms for certain purchases. Operating activities for 2010 were primarily affected by improved management of drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories due to our revenue growth and the AWP litigation private payer settlement payments of $350 million. 44 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Net cash used in investing activities was $1,502 million in 2012 compared to $624 million in 2011 and $309 million in 2010. Investing activities for 2012 included $1,156 million of cash payments for acquisitions, including $919 million for our acquisition of the Katz Assets. Investing activities in 2012 also included $225 million and $178 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2011 included $292 million of cash payments for acquisitions, including $244 million for our acquisition of US Oncology, and $109 million of cash received from the sale of MAP. Investing activities in 2011 also included $233 million and $155 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2010 included $199 million and $179 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software and the release of $55 million of restricted cash from escrow related to the AWP private litigation settlement payments. Financing activities utilized cash of $1,905 million in 2012 compared to $1,841 million in 2011 and $421 million in 2010. Financing activities for 2012 included $1,850 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $400 million of cash paid on the maturity of our 7.75% Notes in February 2012, $195 million of dividends paid, $400 million of cash receipts from secured borrowings and $167 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2011 reflect $1,689 million of cash received from the issuance of long-term debt. In February 2011, we issued $600 million of 3.25% notes due 2016, $600 million of 4.75% notes due 2021, and $500 million of 6.00% notes due 2041. Net proceeds from the issuance of the long-term notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used to pay off the $1,730 million of debt assumed as part of the acquisition of US Oncology. Also as part of our acquisition of US Oncology, we borrowed $1,000 million for bridge financing which was fully repaid by February 2011. Financing activities for 2011 also included $2,050 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $171 million of cash paid for dividends and $367 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2010 included $323 million of cash paid for share repurchases and $218 million of cash paid on our long-term debt, which primarily consisted of $215 million paid on the maturity of our 9.13% Series C Senior Notes in March 2010, $131 million of cash paid for dividends and $212 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options. The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. The Board authorized the repurchase of the Company’s common stock as follows: $1.0 billion in April 2010, $1.0 billion in October 2010, $1.0 billion in April 2011 and $650 million in January 2012. Total share repurchases transacted through ASR programs and open market transactions over the last three years were as follows: Years Ended March 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2012 2011 2010 Number of shares repurchased (1) 20 29 8 Average price paid per share $ 83.47 $ 69.62 $ 41.47 Total value of shares repurchased $ 1,850 $ 2,032 $ 299 (1) Excludes shares surrendered for tax withholding. 45 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) In 2012 and 2011, the majority of our share repurchases were transacted through a number of ASR programs with third party financial institutions as follows: $1.0 billion in May 2010, $275 million in March 2011, $650 million in May 2011 and $1.2 billion in March 2012. In 2010, all of our share repurchases were conducted through open market transactions. All programs were funded with cash on hand. In March 2012, we entered into an ASR program with a third party financial institution to repurchase $1.2 billion of the Company’s common stock. As of March 31, 2012, we had received 12 million shares representing the minimum number of shares due under this program, and the average price paid per share of $87.19 was based on the average daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock less a discount calculated as of March 31, 2012. The total number of shares to be ultimately repurchased by us and the final settlement price per share will be determined at the completion of this program based on the average daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the program, less a discount. This program is anticipated to be completed no later than the second quarter of 2013. In April 2012, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional $700 million of the Company’s common stock, bringing the total authorization outstanding to $1.0 billion. Although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,149 $ 3,612 $ 3,731 Working capital 1,917 3,631 4,492 Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents 831 392 (1,434) Debt to capital ratio (1) 36.8% 35.7% 23.4% Net debt to net capital employed (2) 10.8% 5.1% (23.5)% Return on stockholders’ equity (3) 19.7% 16.9% 18.7% (1) Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders’ equity. (2) Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (“net debt”), divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders’ equity (“net capital employed”). (3) Ratio is computed as net income for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of stockholders’ equity. Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2012 included approximately $1.4 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. During the fourth quarter of 2011 and pursuant to IRS regulations, we temporarily borrowed and repaid $1.0 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside the United States. The duration of this temporary loan to the United States was less than 60 days. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories, net of drafts and accounts payable, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. 46 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2012 compared to March 31, 2011 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2011 compared to March 31, 2010, primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payables, other accrued liabilities and the current portion of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in receivables. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2012 compared to March 31, 2011 primarily due to a lower cash and cash equivalents balance. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2011 compared to March 31, 2010 primarily due to an increase in total debt as a result of the US Oncology acquisition. In May 2010, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.12 to $0.18 per common share and in April 2011, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.18 to $0.20 per common share. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, we paid total cash dividends of $195 million, $171 million and $131 million. Contractual Obligations: The table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2012: Years (In millions) Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5 On balance sheet Long-term debt (1) $ 3,580 $ 508 $ 353 $ 1,100 $ 1,619 Other (2) 405 49 180 66 110 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3) 1,787 195 313 269 1,010 Purchase obligations (4) 576 476 90 10 — Operating lease obligations (5) 868 188 280 167 233 Customer guarantees (6) 166 107 35 3 21 Total $ 7,382 $ 1,523 $ 1,251 $ 1,615 $ 2,993 (1) Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations. (2) Represents our estimated benefit payments for the unfunded benefit plans and minimum funding requirements for the pension plans. (3) Primarily represents interest that will become due on our fixed rate long-term debt obligations. (4) A purchase obligation is defined as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases, capital commitments and service agreements. (5) Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases. (6) Represents primarily agreements with certain of our Canadian customers’ financial institutions under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory or our customers’ debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions. We also have an agreement with one software customer that, under limited circumstances, may require us to secure standby financing. Because the amount of the standby financing is not explicitly stated, the overall amount of this guarantee cannot reasonably be estimated. At March 31, 2012, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $504 million. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table. In addition, at March 31, 2012, our banks and insurance companies have issued $86 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs. 47 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Credit Resources: We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, as well as, short-term borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facility, revolving credit facility and from commercial paper issuances. Senior Bridge Term Loan Facility In connection with our execution of an agreement to acquire US Oncology, in November 2010, we entered into a $2.0 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (“Bridge Loan”). In December 2010, we reduced the Bridge Loan commitment to $1.0 billion. On January 31, 2011, we borrowed $1.0 billion under the Bridge Loan. On February 28, 2011, we repaid the funds obtained under the Bridge Loan with long-term debt, as further described below, and the Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement was terminated. During the time it was outstanding, the Bridge Loan bore interest of 1.76%, which was based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s credit rating. Bridge Loan fees in 2011 of $25 million were included in interest expense. US Oncology Debt Acquired Upon our purchase of US Oncology in December 2010, we assumed the outstanding debt of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary US Oncology, Inc. Immediately prior to our acquisition, US Oncology Holdings, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding Senior Unsecured Floating Rate Toggle Notes due 2012, and US Oncology, Inc. called for redemption all of its outstanding 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 and 10.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we paid interest of $50 million and redeemed these notes, including the remaining accrued interest, for $1,738 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our Bridge Loan. Long-Term Debt On February 28, 2011, we issued 3.25% notes due March 1, 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, 4.75% notes due March 1, 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million and 6.00% notes due March 1, 2041 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on September 1, 2011. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $1,673 million from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the Bridge Loan. We repaid our $400 million 7.75% Notes in February 2012 and our $215 million 9.13% Series C Senior notes in March 2010, both of which had matured. Accounts Receivable Sales Facility In May 2011, we renewed our existing accounts receivable sales facility for a one year period under terms substantially similar to those previously in place. The committed capacity of this facility is $1.35 billion, although, from time-to-time, the available amount of this facility may be less than $1.35 billion based on accounts receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements. During 2012, we borrowed $400 million under this facility. There were no borrowings in 2011 under this facility. At March 31, 2012, there were $400 million in secured borrowings and $400 million of related securitized accounts receivable outstanding, which are included in short-term borrowings and receivables in the consolidated balance sheets, under this facility. At March 31, 2011 there were no secured borrowings or related securitized accounts receivables outstanding under this facility. The current accounts receivable sales facility will expire in May 2012. We anticipate renewing this facility before its expiration. Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in Financial Notes 1 and 12, “Significant Accounting Policies” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 48 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Revolving Credit Facility In September 2011, we renewed our existing syndicated $1.3 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in June 2012. This renewed credit facility has terms and conditions substantially similar to those previously in place and matures in September 2016. Borrowings under this renewed credit facility bear interest based upon either the London Interbank Offered Rate or a prime rate. There were no borrowings under this credit facility during 2012, 2011 and 2010. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Commercial Paper There were no commercial paper issuances during 2012, 2011 and 2010 and no amount outstanding at March 31, 2012 and 2011. Debt Covenant Our various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 56.5%. For the purpose of calculating the debt to capital ratio under this covenant, borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facility are excluded. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2012, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings, or the lack of compliance with our covenants, could negatively impact our ability to finance operations or issue additional debt at acceptable interest rates. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 21, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS New accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 49 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION FINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2012, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. Should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2012, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $18 million. The selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. As of March 31, 2012 and 2011, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. Foreign exchange risk: We derive revenues and earnings from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries, Israel and Mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. As of March 31, 2012, a hypothetical adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 50 Table of Contents McKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:28.927962

(“PSS World Medical”) which were completed in February 2014 and 2013, and our mix of business. Revenues for 2014 were also impacted by price deflation associated with brand to generics drug conversion. Revenues for 2013 approximated 2012 primarily reflecting market growth, net of price deflation.Gross profit and gross profit margin increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to our business acquisitions, growth in sales of higher margin generic drugs, higher buy margin and our mix of business, partially offset by a decrease in sell margin. Additionally, 2014 gross profit was impacted by LIFO-related inventory charges of $311 million. Operating expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and higher intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. Operating expenses in 2013 were favorably impacted by an $81 million non-cash gain on business combination and lower Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) litigation charges, partially offset by a $40 million charge for a legal dispute and a $36 million charge for goodwill impairment. AWP litigation charges were $68 million, $72 million and $149 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012.Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased in 2014 and 2013 reflecting higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating and interest expenses. Increased interest expense in 2014 was primarily attributable to our acquisition of Celesio. Additionally, in 2013 we committed to a plan to sell our 49% equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V (“Nadro”) and recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $191 million reducing the investment’s carrying value to its estimated fair value. Nadro was sold in 2014 with no material gain or loss on its disposition.30Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Our reported income tax rates were 35.4%, 30.1% and 27.2% in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates, and discrete items. Income tax expense included $94 million of net discrete tax expense in 2014, and $29 million and $66 million of net discrete tax benefit in 2013 and 2012. Discrete tax expense for 2014 primarily related to a $122 million charge regarding an unfavorable decision from the Tax Court of Canada with respect to transfer pricing issues. Included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit is a $31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit relating to our AWP litigation.During 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our International Technology business and our Hospital Automation business from our Technology Solutions segment and certain small businesses from our Distribution Solutions segment. In the third quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of $80 million to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated net realizable value (fair value less costs to sell).Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $1,263 million, $1,338 million and $1,403 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, and diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation were $5.41, $5.59 and $5.59. Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding primarily due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases. On February 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of Celesio and certain convertible bonds of Celesio for cash consideration of $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired. Upon the acquisition, our ownership of Celesio’s fully diluted shares was 75.6% and as required, we consolidated Celesio’s debt with a fair value of $2.3 billion as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. At March 31, 2014, we owned approximately 75.4% of Celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares. The acquisition was funded by utilizing a senior bridge loan, our existing accounts receivable facility and cash on hand. Celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and a provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. Celesio’s headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world. The acquisition of Celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide.Revenues: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2014 2013 2012 2014 2013Distribution Solutions North America pharmaceutical distribution& services$123,930 $115,443 $116,279 7% (1)%International pharmaceutical distribution & services4,848 — — — — Medical-Surgical distribution & services5,648 3,603 3,145 57 15 Total Distribution Solutions134,426 119,046 119,424 13 — Technology Solutions - products and services3,183 3,023 2,897 5 4 Total Revenues$137,609 $122,069 $122,321 13 — Revenues for 2014 increased 13% to $137.6 billion from 2013 and revenues for 2013 of $122.1 billion approximated 2012. Increases in our revenues were primarily driven by our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 98% of our consolidated revenues. 31Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Distribution SolutionsNorth America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to market growth, reflecting growing drug utilization and price increases, and our mix of business. These increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generics drug conversion. North America revenues for 2013 approximated 2012 primarily due to market growth and our mix of business, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions, the loss of customers and fewer sales days. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues of $4.8 billion in 2014 represents revenues from Celesio, our majority-owned subsidiary, acquired in February 2014.Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our acquisition of PSS World Medical in February 2013 and market growth. Revenues for 2013 increased compared to 2012 primarily due to market growth, new customers and our acquisition of PSS World Medical. These 2013 increases were partially offset by five less sales days.Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to small business acquisitions and a higher volume of claims processing. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in software product revenues. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to acquisitions, higher volume of claims processing revenues and an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers.

Gross profit increased 21% to $8.3 billion in 2014 and 7% to $6.8 billion in 2013. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 43 bp in 2014 and by 38 bp in 2013. Gross profit margin increased in 2014 and 2013 reflecting increases in both of our operating segments.32Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Distribution SolutionsDistribution Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our business acquisitions, growth in sales of higher margin generic drugs, and an increase in buy margin. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sell margin and charges related to the LIFO method of accounting for inventories, as further described below. Additionally, gross profit was impacted by a $50 million charge for the reversal of a fair value step-up of inventory acquired as part of the Celesio acquisition. Gross profit margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher sales of generic drugs, business acquisitions, an increase in buy margin and antitrust settlement receipts, and a lower proportion of revenues within the segment attributed to lower-margin sales to customers’ warehouses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sell margin. Our last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) net inventory expense was $311 million in 2014, $13 million in 2013 and $11 million in 2012. Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The practice in the Distribution Solutions segment’s distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. From 2005 through 2011, we experienced net price deflation and in 2012 and 2013, we began to experience a modest net inflationary trend in our pharmaceuticals indices, as price increases on branded pharmaceuticals exceeded the impact of price declines and shifts toward generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. As a result of this cumulative net price deflation, at March 31, 2013, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $60 million more than market and, accordingly, a $60 million lower-of-cost or market (“LCM”) reserve reduced inventories to market. During 2014, we experienced net inflation in our pharmaceutical inventories. As a result, in 2014, we recorded LIFO charges of $311 million to cost of sales, net of the LCM reserve release. As of March 31, 2014, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. At March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments were $431 million and $120 million. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” included in this Financial Review.Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to growth in higher-margin revenues, partially offset by product alignment charges. Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a change in product and services mix and a decline in product alignment charges partially offset by a $10 million impairment of capitalized software held for sale. In 2014, this segment recorded pre-tax charges totaling $57 million. These charges primarily consisted of $35 million of product alignment charges, $15 million of integration-related expenses and $7 million of reduction-in-workforce severance charges. Included in the total charge was $35 million for severance for employees primarily in our research and development, customer services and sales functions, and $15 million for asset impairments which primarily represents the write-off of deferred costs for a product that will no longer be developed. Charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows: $34 million in cost of sales and $23 million in operating expenses. In 2013, this segment recorded $46 million of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges. These charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. The charge included a $36 million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value. In addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis. This impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. The balance of the charge represents a $10 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value. We concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations. 33Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)In 2012, we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within this segment. As part of this alignment strategy, we began converging our core clinical and revenue cycle Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon’s Microsoft®-based platform. We also stopped development of our HzERM software product. As the result of this plan, we recorded product alignment charges of $51 million, of which $31 million was recorded to cost of sales and $20 million was recorded to operating expenses.

Operating expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and higher intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. Additionally, 2013 operating expenses were impacted by a $40 million charge for a legal dispute in our Canadian business, a $36 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, an $81 million gain on business combination, and lower AWP charges. Distribution SolutionsDistribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to our business acquisitions and higher employee compensation and benefit costs. Operating expenses in 2013 were also impacted by lower AWP charges and a $40 million charge for a legal dispute in our Canadian business.The Company has a reserve relating to AWP public entity claims, which is reviewed at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate changes, including consideration of the pace and progress of discussions relating to potentially resolving other public entity claims. Charges related to AWP litigation, including accrued interest, are recorded in operating expenses within our Distribution Solutions segment. Such pre-tax charges were $68 million, $72 million and $149 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012.Refer to Financial Note 22, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions segment’s operating expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to small business acquisitions, integration-related expenses, reduction-in-workforce severance charges, and continued investment in research and development activities. These increases were partially offset by a $36 million goodwill impairment charge incurred in 2013. Technology Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to our continued investment in research and development activities, a $36 million goodwill impairment charge and acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by product alignment charges incurred in 2012. The goodwill impairment was recorded to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value. 34Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)CorporateCorporate expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs, acquisition‑related expenses and the 2013 $81 million gain on business combination. Corporate expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the gain on business combination and a charitable contribution in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in a reserve for an environmental liability, acquisition-related expenses and other corporate initiatives.In 2013, we purchased the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California for $90 million, which was funded from cash on hand. We previously held a 50% ownership interest and were the primary tenant in this building. This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition, which requires that we re-measure our previously held 50% ownership interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations. The re-measurement to fair value resulted in a non-cash pre-tax gain of $81 million ($51 million after-tax), which was recorded as a gain on business combination within Corporate in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition Expenses and Related AdjustmentsAcquisition expenses and related adjustments, which include transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to acquisitions by the Company and gains and losses related to business combinations were $218 million, $1 million and $26 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Expenses for 2014 were primarily related to our acquisition of Celesio and integration of PSS World Medical. Expenses for 2013 primarily pertained to PSS World Medical and a $81 million gain on business combination from our acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our Corporate headquarters building. Expenses for 2012 were primarily incurred to integrate a 2011 acquisition. Additional acquisition-related expenses are expected to be incurred as we integrate our businesses.

Impairment of an Equity Investment: In 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our 49% equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”) and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191 million reducing the investment’s carrying value to its estimated fair value. The charge reflected deterioration in Nadro’s market position, projected lower revenue growth rates and operating margins and continued business challenges in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution business in Mexico. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $69 million were included in the assessment of the investment’s carrying value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses (net of tax), were included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on our consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2013. The charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment. In September 2013, we completed the sale of our 49% equity interest in Nadro. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $41 million in total cash consideration. There was no material gain or loss on the disposition based on the adjusted net realizable value of the investment at the time of the sale. 36Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Segment Operating Profit, Corporate Expenses, Net and Interest Expense: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2014 2013 2012 2014 2013Segment Operating Profit Distribution Solutions$2,461 $2,195 $2,219 12% (1)%Technology Solutions387 308 338 26 (9) Subtotal2,848 2,503 2,557 14 (2) Corporate Expenses, Net(449) (335) (413) 34 (19) Interest Expense(303) (240) (251) 26 (4) Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes$2,096 $1,928 $1,893 9 2 Segment Operating Profit Margin Distribution Solutions1.83%1.84%1.86% (1)bp (2)bp Technology Solutions12.16 10.19 11.67 197 (148) Distribution Solutions: Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment in 2014 was flat compared to 2013, primarily reflecting an increase in gross profit margin and the $191 million impairment charge on an equity investment incurred in 2013, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which includes the effects of our acquisitions. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the $191 million impairment charge on an equity investment and higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which included the effects of our acquisitions. These 2013 increases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin. Technology Solutions: Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in gross profit margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.

Corporate expenses for 2013 also included the $81 million gain on business combination. Corporate expenses, net of other income decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the gain on business combination and an increase in other income.Interest Expense: Interest expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to our acquisition of Celesio, including $46 million of bridge loan fees, interest on $4.1 billion of new debt issued to fund the acquisition and interest on debt of Celesio. These increases are partially offset by repayment of $500 million of the current portion of our long-term debt in March 2013. Interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the repayment of $400 million of long-term debt in February 2012, partially offset by $11 million of bridge loan fees paid in connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt that is repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred for bridge loan fees. Refer to our discussion under the caption “Credit Resources” within this Financial Review for additional information regarding our financing activities. 37Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Income Taxes Our reported income tax rates were 35.4%, 30.1% and 27.2% in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates and discrete items. Income tax expense included $94 million of net discrete tax expense in 2014, and $29 million and $66 million of net discrete tax benefit in 2013 and 2012. Discrete tax expense for 2014 primarily related to a $122 million charge regarding an unfavorable decision from the Tax Court of Canada with respect to transfer pricing issues. Included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit is a $31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit relating to our AWP litigation.We have received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for a total of $219 million related to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2009. We previously appealed the reassessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2009. On December 13, 2013, the Tax Court of Canada dismissed our appeal of the reassessment with respect to 2003. On January 10, 2014, we filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal in response to the judgment of the Tax Court of Canada. As a result of the unfavorable Tax Court decision relating to 2003, we recognized a discrete tax expense of $122 million in the third quarter of 2014, which includes tax and interest for the years 2003 through 2013. The ultimate resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense. We have received tax assessments of $98 million from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) relating to 2003 through 2006. We are pursuing administrative relief through the appeals process. We continue to believe in the merits of our tax positions and that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to these examinations in our financial statements.Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxResults from discontinued operations, net of tax, were losses of $96 million and $9 million in 2014 and 2013, and income of $24 million in 2012. Results for 2014 include a non-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of $80 million. In 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our International Technology business and our Hospital Automation business from our Technology Solutions segment and certain small businesses from our Distribution Solutions segment. During the third quarter of 2014, we recorded the $80 million impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our International Technology business to its estimated net realizable value (fair value less costs to sell). The charge was primarily the result of the terms of the preliminary purchase offers received for all of the business during the third quarter of 2014. A portion of the impairment charge was attributed to goodwill and other long-lived assets and as a result, there was no tax benefit associated with this portion of the charge. The ultimate selling price of our International Technology business may be higher or lower than our current assessment of fair value. In 2014, we sold our Hospital Automation business for cash proceeds of $55 million, which approximates the business’ net book value. The results of operations for these businesses are included in income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2014, 2013 and 2012.Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: Noncontrolling interests primarily represent the portion of Celesio’s net profit or loss that is not allocable to McKesson Corporation. At March 31, 2014, McKesson owned approximately 75.4% of Celesio’s common shares on an outstanding fully diluted basis.Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation: Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $1,263 million, $1,338 million and $1,403 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012 and diluted earnings per common share were $5.41, $5.59 and $5.59. Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 233 million, 239 million and 251 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012. The decreases in the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding primarily reflect the cumulative effect of share repurchases, partially offset by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards.38Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Foreign OperationsForeign operations accounted for 11.0%, 8.2% and 8.4% of 2014, 2013 and 2012 consolidated revenues. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is also included in Financial Note 25, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Business CombinationsFiscal 2014On February 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of Celesio and certain convertible bonds of Celesio for cash consideration of $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired (the “Acquisition”). Upon the acquisition, our ownership of Celesio’s fully diluted shares was 75.6% and, as required, we consolidated Celesio’s debt with a fair value of $2.3 billion as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The Acquisition was funded by utilizing a senior bridge loan, our existing accounts receivable facility and cash on hand. Celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and a provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. Celesio’s headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world. The acquisition of Celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide.Our acquisition of Celesio was consummated through a series of transactions: •129.3 million of common shares of Celesio were acquired from Franz Haniel & Cie. GmbH (“Haniel”) for cash consideration of €23.50 per common share or $4,128 million. •4,840 of the 7,000 convertible bonds issued by Celesio in the nominal aggregate amount of €350 million due in October 2014 (the “2014 Bonds”), and 2,180 of the 3,500 convertible bonds issued by Celesio in the nominal amount of €350 million due in April 2018 (the “2018 Bonds”) were acquired from Elliot International, L.P., The Liverpool Limited Partnership and Elliot Capital Advisers, L.P. (together, the “Elliot Group”) for cash consideration of $951 million. The 2,180 acquired 2018 Bonds were converted to 11.4 million common shares of Celesio.•303 of the 2014 Bonds and 216 of the 2018 Bonds were acquired in private transactions for cash consideration of $63 million. 139 of the acquired 2018 Bonds were converted to 0.7 million common shares of Celesio.From February 7, 2014 through March 31, 2014, we converted our remaining 2014 Bonds and 2018 Bonds into 11.9 million of Celesio common shares. Also during this time period, substantially all of the remaining 2014 Bonds and 2018 Bonds held by third parties were converted to 9 million Celesio common shares valued at $313 million and approximately $30 million in cash. At March 31, 2014, we owned approximately 75.4% of Celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares. In accordance with a business combination agreement that we entered into with Celesio in January 2014, on February 28, 2014 and April 7, 2014 we launched voluntary public tender offers for the common shares of Celesio that remain outstanding for €23.50 per share. In April 2014, the last of these tender offers expired and we acquired 1 million of additional common shares. We also intend to enter into a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement, with Celesio as the dominated party, pursuant to Sections 291 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz - AktG). Such a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement does not require any further regulatory approval.Fiscal 2013In addition to our April 2012 acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California, on February 22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of PSS World Medical for $29.00 per share plus the assumption of PSS World Medical’s debt, or approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate, consisting of cash consideration of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of long-term debt with a fair value of $0.6 billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of long-term debt. PSS World Medical markets and distributes medical products and services throughout the United States. The acquisition of PSS World Medical expands our existing Medical-Surgical business. Financial results for PSS World Medical since the acquisition date are included in the results of operations within our Medical-Surgical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013.39Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Fiscal 2012On March 25, 2012, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Drug Trading Company Limited, the independent banner business of the Katz Group Canada Inc. (“Katz Group”), and Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc., the franchise business of the Katz Group (collectively, “Katz Assets”) for $925 million, which was funded from cash on hand. The acquisition of the assets from the Drug Trading Company Limited consists of a marketing and purchasing arm of independently owned pharmacies in Canada. The acquisition of Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc. consists of the franchise business of providing services to independent pharmacies in Canada. Financial results for the acquired Katz Assets have been included in the results of operations within our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, beginning in the first quarter of 2013.During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 14, “Business Combinations” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.2015 OutlookInformation regarding the Company’s 2015 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 13, 2014. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.40Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2014, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 48% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Caremark Corporation (""CVS""), accounted for approximately 16% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2014, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 32% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS were approximately 12% of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2014 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue.At March 31, 2014, trade and notes receivables were $12,755 million prior to allowances of $113 million. In 2014, 2013 and 2012 our provision for bad debts was $38 million, $28 million and $30 million. At March 31, 2014 and 2013, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 0.9% and 1.4%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2014 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $13 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”). Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $13.3 billion and $10.3 billion at March 31, 2014 and 2013. 41Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The LIFO method was used to value approximately 67% and 80% of our inventories at March 31, 2014 and 2013. If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately $431 million and $120 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2014 and 2013. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2014, 2013, and 2012, we recognized net LIFO expense of $311 million, $13 million and $11 million within our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. Primarily due to historical net deflation in our pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $60 million higher than market as of March 31, 2013. As a result, we recorded a LCM credit of $60 million and $16 million in 2014 and 2013 within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market.In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete, as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9,927 million and $6,405 million of goodwill at March 31, 2014 and 2013 and $5,022 million and $2,270 million of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2014 and 2013. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services, customers and operating margin are aggregated as a single reporting unit. Management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing. 42Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangibles assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2014 and 2012, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. In 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $36 million in our Technology Solutions segment. For our newly-acquired Celesio operations, we determined the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using various methods, including an overall discounted cash flow analysis performed for all of Celesio’s operations. As of March 31, 2014, the fair value assignments were preliminary and could change significantly upon finalization of the fair value assignments. Currently, all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to thirty-eight years. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. There were no material impairments of intangibles in 2014, 2013 or 2012. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.43Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, supplier reserves were $181 million and $164 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2014 and 2013 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2014 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $22 million in 2014. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,332 million and $1,247 million at March 31, 2014 and 2013 and deferred tax liabilities of $4,133 million and $3,114 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and intangible assets. We established valuation allowances of $270 million and $118 million for 2014 and 2013 against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $21 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for 2014. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. 44Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facilities, revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time-to-time. Net cash flow from operating activities was $3,136 million in 2014 compared to $2,483 million in 2013 and $2,950 million in 2012. Operating activities for 2014 were affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases. Operating activities for 2014 also reflect increases in receivables and inventories primarily associated with our revenue growth. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors.Operating activities for 2013 were primarily affected by $483 million of payments made for AWP litigation settlements. Operating activities for 2012 reflect an increase in drafts and accounts payable primarily associated with longer payment terms for certain purchases, partially offset by an increase in receivables and higher inventories primarily associated with revenue growth. Net cash used in investing activities was $5,046 million in 2014 compared to $2,209 million in 2013 and $1,502 million in 2012. Investing activities for 2014 included $4,634 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $4,497 million for our acquisition of Celesio. Investing activities in 2014 also included $274 million and $141 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2014 also reflect $97 million of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and an equity investment.Investing activities for 2013 included $1,873 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $1,299 million for our acquisition of PSS World Medical. Investing activities in 2013 also included $232 million and $153 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2012 included $1,051 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $919 million for our acquisition of the Katz Assets. Investing activities in 2012 also included $221 million and $177 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Financing activities generated cash of $3,619 million in 2014 compared to net cash usage of $956 million in 2013 and $1,905 million in 2012. Financing activities for 2014 include cash receipts of $788 million and cash paid of $765 million from short-term borrowings. In connection with our acquisition of Celesio, we also borrowed $4,957 billion million under a senior bridge loan facility and $400 million under our accounts receivable sales facility in February 2014. These borrowings were fully repaid in March 2014. Financing activities for 2014 also include cash receipts of $4,114 million from the issuance of long-term debt in March 2014 and cash paid of $356 for repayments of long-term debt, primarily consisting of $350 million paid on the maturity of our 6.50% Notes due in February 2014. Additionally, financing activities for 2014 included $130 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $214 million of dividends paid.45Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Financing activities for 2013 included cash receipts of $1,325 million and cash paid of $1,725 million from short-term borrowings. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical, we borrowed $900 million for bridge financing in February 2013, which was fully repaid in March 2013. Financing activities for 2013 also include cash receipts of $1,798 million for the issuance of long-term debt and cash paid of $1,143 million for repayments of long-term debt. In December 2012, we issued $500 million of 0.95% Notes due 2015 and $400 million of 2.70% Notes due 2022. In March 2013, we issued $500 million of 1.40% Notes due 2018 and $400 million of 2.85% Notes dues 2023. Long-term debt repayments include $500 million paid on the maturity of our 5.25% Notes due in March 2013 and $635 million paid to redeem the debt acquired on the acquisition of PSS World Medical. Additionally, financing activities for 2013 included $1,214 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $194 million of dividends paid.Financing activities for 2012 included $1,874 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $400 million of cash paid on the maturity of our 7.75% Notes in February 2012, $195 million of dividends paid, $400 million of cash receipts from secured borrowings and $167 million of cash receipts from employees’ exercises of stock options. The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. The Board authorized the repurchase of the Company’s common stock as follows: $1.0 billion in April 2010, $1.0 billion in October 2010, $1.0 billion in April 2011, $650 million in January 2012, $700 million in April 2012 and $500 million in January 2013. Total share repurchases transacted through ASR programs and open market transactions over the last three years were as follows: Years Ended March 31,(In millions, except per share data)2014 2013 2012Number of shares repurchased (1)— 13 20Average price paid per share$— $100.82 $83.47Total value of shares repurchased (1)$— $1,159 $1,850(1)Excludes shares surrendered for tax withholding.The total authorization outstanding for repurchases of the Company’s common stock was $340 million at March 31, 2014.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired approximately 2 million shares repurchased for $217 million by the Company. The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. As such, $195 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings.We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.46Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions)2014 2013 2012Cash and cash equivalents$4,193 $2,456 $3,149 Working capital3,072 1,813 1,917 Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents6,526 2,417 831 Debt to capital ratio (1)55.7% 40.8% 36.8%Net debt to net capital employed (2)43.4 25.5 10.8 Return on McKesson stockholders’ equity (3)16.2 18.3 19.7 (1)Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, excluding noncontrolling interests.(2)Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (“net debt”), divided by the sum of net debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, excluding noncontrolling interests (“net capital employed”).(3)Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders’ equity, excluding noncontrolling interests.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in Euros, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury bonds, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. Deposits at U.S. banks exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds. Within the Celesio operations, the majority of deposits are placed in Germany with only banks that are part of deposit protection programs.Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2014 included approximately $2.4 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2014 compared to March 31, 2013 primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents, and increases in receivables, inventories and current portion of long-term debt associated with our acquisition of Celesio. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2013 compared to March 31, 2012, primarily due to a decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2014 compared to March 31, 2013 primarily due to the increase in debt associated with our Celesio acquisition. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2013 compared to March 31, 2012 primarily due to a lower cash and cash equivalents balance.In July 2013, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.20 to $0.24 per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board. Dividends were $0.92 per share in 2014 and $0.80 per share in 2013 and 2012. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we paid total cash dividends of $214 million, $194 million and $195 million.47Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Contractual Obligations:The table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2014: Years(In millions)Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5On balance sheet Long-term debt (1)$10,373 $1,424 $2,812 $2,005 $4,132Other (2)638 75 216 132 215 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3)3,572 357 667 470 2,078Purchase obligations (4)2,920 2,901 19 — —Operating lease obligations (5) 2,070 358 545 361 806Other (6)488 177 64 58 189Total$20,061 $5,292 $4,323 $3,026 $7,420(1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations.

Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table.In addition, at March 31, 2014, our banks and insurance companies have issued $161 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs. Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facilities, revolving credit facilities and from commercial paper issuances. Senior Bridge Term Loan FacilitiesIn connection with our acquisition of Celesio, in January 2014, we entered into a $5.5 billion 364‑day unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (the “2014 Bridge Loan”) under terms substantially similar to those in our existing revolving credit facility. On February 4, 2014, we borrowed $4,957 million under this facility, with such proceeds and cash on hand used to fund the acquisition of Celesio. On March 10, 2014, we repaid $4,076 million of the 2014 Bridge Loan borrowings with funds obtained from the issuance of long-term debt. On March 11, 2014, we repaid the remaining balance of the 2014 Bridge Loan borrowings using funds drawn on our Accounts Receivable Sales facility and cash on hand. On April 30, 2014, the commitments under the 2014 Bridge Loan automatically terminated upon the settlement of the tender offers for the remaining common shares of Celesio. During the time it was outstanding, the 2014 Bridge Loan borrowings bore interest at 1.39% per annum, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s credit rating. Interest expense for 2014 includes a total of $46 million of fees related to the 2014 Bridge Loan and a bridge loan agreement entered into during the third quarter of 2014 in anticipation of an earlier acquisition of Celesio. 48Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)In connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical, in December 2012 we entered into a $2.1 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (“2013 Bridge Loan”). In February 2013, we reduced the 2013 Bridge Loan commitment to $900 million. On February 22, 2013, we borrowed $900 million under the 2013 Bridge Loan, with such proceeds and cash on hand were used to redeem the assumed debt from PSS World Medical and pay the equity shareholders of PSS World Medical. On March 8, 2013, we repaid the 2013 Bridge Loan borrowings with funds obtained from the issuance of long-term debt and the bridge loan agreement was subsequently terminated. During the time it was outstanding, the 2013 Bridge Loan borrowings bore interest at 1.20% per annum, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company’s credit rating. Interest expense for 2013 includes $11 million of fees related to the 2013 Bridge Loan. Celesio DebtUpon our acquisition of Celesio, as required, we consolidated a total of $2.3 billion of outstanding debt of Celesio as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The Celesio debt consists primarily of corporate bonds, convertible debt, promissory notes and amounts outstanding under their accounts receivable facility arrangements and lines of credits. Debt maturities range from our fiscal years 2015 to 2024. As of March 31, 2014, Celesio convertible debt of $344 million was extinguished through the issuance of Celesio common stock or cash. As of March 31, 2014, $246 million and $188 million were outstanding under the accounts receivable factoring facility arrangements and lines of credits with committed balances of $308 million and $1,662 million.According to certain terms and conditions of Celesio’s 4.00% bonds maturing on October 18, 2016 and their 4.50% bonds maturing on April 26, 2017, effective May 7, 2014 bondholders have the option to ask for repayment of the bonds at par value plus accrued interest. If bondholders do not exercise this option by May 19, 2014, the bonds will remain outstanding until their respective maturity dates. Accordingly, as at March 31, 2014, these bonds having a book value of $1,244 million have been classified as a current liability. As of May 7, 2014, the fair value of these bonds of $1,272 million was more than their par value of $1,184 million. PSS World Medical DebtUpon our acquisition of PSS World Medical, we assumed the outstanding debt of PSS World Medical. Prior to our acquisition, PSS World Medical called for redemption of all of its outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2022. Due to the change in control provisions of the 3.125% Senior Convertible Notes due 2014, the notes were convertible to cash at the option of the note holders. All the note holders opted to receive cash. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we redeemed both of these notes, including accrued interest for $643 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our 2013 PSS Bridge Loan.Long-Term DebtIn connection with the acquisition of Celesio, on March 5, 2014, we issued floating rate notes (“Floating Rate Notes”) due September 10, 2015 in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million, 1.29% notes due March 10, 2017 in an aggregate principal amount of $700 million (“2017 Notes”), 2.28% notes due March 15, 2019 in an aggregate principal amount of $1,100 million (“2019 Notes”), 3.80% notes due March 15, 2024 in an aggregate principal amount of $1,100 million (“2024 Notes”) and 4.88% notes due March 15, 2044 in an aggregate principal amount of $800 million (“2044 Notes”). The Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 0.40% (0.64% at March 31, 2014). We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses of $4,068 million from the issuance of these notes (each note constitutes a “Series”) to repay borrowings under the 2014 Bridge Loan.On March 8, 2013, we issued 1.40% notes due March 15, 2018 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and 2.85% notes due March 15, 2023 in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses of $891 million from the issuance of these notes (each note constitutes a “Series”) to repay borrowings under the 2013 Bridge Loan.On December 4, 2012, we issued 0.95% notes due December 4, 2015 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (“2015 Notes”) and 2.70% notes due December 15, 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million (“2022 Notes”). We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $892 million from the issuance of these notes (each note constitutes a “Series”) for general corporate purposes and replenishing working capital that was used to repay long-term debt that matured. 49Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Each Series constitutes an unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Company and ranks equally with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness outstanding from time-to-time. Each Series is governed by materially similar indentures and officers’ certificate specifying certain terms of each Series.With the exception of the Floating Rate Notes, upon 30 days notice to holders of a Series, we may redeem that Series at any time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, for cash at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium, as specified in the indenture and officers’ certificate relating to that Series. In the event of the occurrence of both (1) a change of control of the Company and (2) a downgrade of a Series below an investment grade rating by each of Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services within a specified period, an offer must be made to purchase that Series from the holders at a price in cash equal to 101% of the then outstanding principal amount of that Series, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase. The indenture and the related officers’ certificate for each Series, subject to the exceptions and in compliance with the conditions as applicable, specify that we may not incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. The indentures also contain customary events of default provisions.We repaid our $350 million 6.50% Notes due February 15, 2014 and our $500 million 5.25% Notes due March 1, 2013, at maturity. Scheduled future payments of long-term debt are $1,424 million in 2015, $1,535 million in 2016, $1,277 million in 2017, $520 million in 2018, $1,485 million in 2019 and $4,132 million thereafter.Accounts Receivable Sales FacilityWe have an Accounts Receivable Sales facility (the “Facility”) with a committed balance of $1.35 billion, although from time-to-time, the available amount of the Facility may be less than $1.35 billion based on accounts receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements. Prior to the Celesio acquisition, we amended the Facility to extend the term for an additional year, increased the maximum debt to capital ratio from 56.5% to 65% and added an extended cure period with respect to defaults under the facility relating to Celesio. The Facility will expire in November 2014 and we anticipate renewing the Facility before its expiration. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, we borrowed $550 million, $1,325 million and $400 million under the Facility and we repaid $550 million, $1,725 million and nil. At March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, there were no secured borrowings and related securitized accounts receivable outstanding under the Facility.The Facility contains requirements relating to the performance of the accounts receivable and covenants relating to the Company. If we do not comply with these covenants, our ability to use the Facility may be suspended and repayment of any outstanding balances under the Facility may be required. At March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a syndicated $1.3 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in September 2016. Prior to the Celesio acquisition, we amended this facility to increase the maximum debt to capital ratio from 56.5% to 65%, and added an extended cure period with respect to defaults under the credit facility relating to Celesio. Borrowings under this renewed credit facility bear interest based upon either the London Interbank Offered Rate or a prime rate. There were no borrowings under this credit facility during 2014, 2013 and 2012. As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.Commercial PaperThere were no commercial paper issuances during 2014, 2013 and 2012 and no amounts outstanding at March 31, 2014 and 2013. 50Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Debt CovenantsOur various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our U.S. dollar denominated debt to capital ratio under our $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 65%. For the purpose of calculating this ratio, borrowings under the $1.35 billion Accounts Receivable Sales facility are excluded. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2014, we were in compliance with our financial covenants.Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in Financial Notes 1 and 14, “Significant Accounting Policies” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 24, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.51Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. At March 31, 2014, we had $1.0 billion in outstanding debt with variable interest rates. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2014, we had $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2014 of approximately $12 million.Foreign exchange risk: Historically, we have recorded foreign revenues and earnings primarily from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries and Israel, which exposed us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our acquisition of a majority interest in Celesio in the fourth quarter of 2014 increased our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and expanded our portfolio of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. As substantially all revenues and earnings of Celesio are generated outside of the United States, changes in the U.S. dollar relative to the functional currency in the countries in which Celesio operates, primarily the Euro and the British pound, could impact future earnings. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency loans. As of March 31, 2014, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of Celesio’s foreign exchange contracts by approximately $94 million. As of March 31, 2014, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our remaining foreign exchange contracts by approximately $40 million. However, Celesio’s risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Refer to Financial Note 18, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward-exchange contracts.The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.52Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:41.904218

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying financial notes in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the Company's fiscal year.Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to these statements; also see Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations.We conduct our business through two operating segments: McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions.

Revenues over the last two years benefited from market growth, which includes growing drug utilization and price increases, in our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues, as well as due to our business acquisitions. In addition, revenues for 2013 were impacted by price deflation associated with brand to generics drug conversion and the loss of customers.Gross profit and gross profit margin increased over each of the last two years. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased 35 basis points (“bp”) to 5.70% in 2013 and 2 bp to 5.35% in 2012. Gross profit margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to higher generics income, business acquisitions, higher buy margin, a $44 million benefit associated with the receipt of our share of settlements of antitrust class action lawsuits brought against drug manufacturers and a lower proportion of revenues attributed to sales to customers' warehouses. Additionally, gross profit margin was unfavorably impacted in 2012 by $31 million of product alignment charges. These increases in the 2013 gross profit margin were partially offset by a decrease in sell margin.Gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to business acquisitions, higher generics income in our Distribution Solutions segment and an increase in higher margin revenues in our Technology Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sell margin and by $31 million of product alignment charges. Additionally, gross profit margin in 2011 was impacted by a $51 million benefit associated with the receipt of our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer and a $72 million asset impairment charge for capitalized software held for sale.Operating expenses increased over each of the last two years. Operating expenses increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to our acquisitions, higher employee compensation and benefit costs, a $40 million charge for a legal dispute and a $36 million charge for goodwill impairment. These increases were partially offset by an $81 million gain on business combination and lower Average Wholesale Price (""AWP"") litigation charges. Operating expenses increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to expenses associated with supporting our higher revenues, business acquisitions, and higher employee compensation and benefits costs. These increases were partially offset by lower AWP litigation charges. AWP litigation charges were $72 million, $149 million and $213 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011.On April 6, 2012, we purchased the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California for $90 million, which was funded from cash on hand. We previously held a 50% ownership interest and were the primary tenant in this building. This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition, which requires that we re-measure our previously held 50% ownership interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations. The re-measurement to fair value resulted in a non-cash pre-tax gain of $81 million ($51 million after-tax), which was recorded as a gain on business combination within Corporate in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2013.Other income, net was $35 million, $21 million and $36 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Based on a recent evaluation we committed to a plan to sell our 49% equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V (""Nadro"") and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $191 million reducing the investment's carrying value to its estimated fair value. The charge reflects deterioration in Nadro's market position, projected lower revenue growth rates and operating margins and continued business challenges in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution business in Mexico.Interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased in 2012 compared with 2011. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt that is repaid and new debt issued, as well as fees paid on bridge loan facilities used in acquiring businesses. Our reported income tax rates were 30.3%, 26.9% and 30.9% in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates, and discrete items. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, income tax expense includes $29 million, $66 million and $34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items, which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. Included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit, is a $31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our AWP litigation.28Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Net income was $1,338 million, $1,403 million and $1,202 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, and diluted earnings per common share were $5.59, $5.59 and $4.57. Net income for 2011 includes a $72 million after-tax gain ($0.28 per diluted share) on the sale of a wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Asia Pacific Pty Limited (“MAP”). Historical financial results for this subsidiary were not material. Diluted earnings per common share were favorably affected by decreases in our weighted average shares outstanding primarily due to the cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, we repurchased 13 million, 20 million and 29 million of our common shares.Revenues: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2013 2012 2011 2013 2012Distribution Solutions Direct distribution & services$86,816 $85,523 $77,554 2% 10%Sales to customers’ warehouses18,646 20,453 18,631 (9) 10 Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution & services105,462 105,976 96,185 — 10 Canada pharmaceutical distribution & services9,981 10,303 9,784 (3) 5 Medical-Surgical distribution & services3,611 3,145 2,920 15 8 Total Distribution Solutions119,054 119,424 108,889 — 10 Technology Solutions Services2,724 2,594 2,483 5 4 Software & software systems576 596 590 (3) 1 Hardware101 120 122 (16) (2) Total Technology Solutions3,401 3,310 3,195 3 4 Total Revenues$122,455 $122,734 $112,084 — 10 Revenues for 2013 approximated the prior year and increased 10% to $122.7 billion in 2012. Changes in our revenues were primarily impacted by our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our consolidated revenues. The increase in revenues in 2012 includes our December 2010 acquisition of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. (""US Oncology"").Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to market growth, which includes growing drug utilization and price increases, expanded volume with existing customers and new customers, partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions, the loss of customers and two less sales days. Direct distribution and services revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to market growth and from our acquisition of US Oncology. These increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Sales to customers' warehouses for 2013 decreased compared to 2012 primarily due to price deflation associated with brand to generic drugs conversions, net of brand price inflation and two less sales days. Sales to customers' warehouses for 2012 increased compared to 2011 primarily due to a new customer and new business with existing customers. Sales to customers' warehouses represent large volume sales of pharmaceuticals primarily to a limited number of large self-warehousing retail chain customers whereby we order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and subsequently deliver the bulk product (generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer) directly to our customers' warehouses. This distribution method is typically not marketed or sold by the Company as a stand-alone service; rather, it is offered as an additional distribution method for our large retail chain customers that have an internal self-warehousing distribution network. Sales to customers' warehouses provide a benefit to these customers because they can utilize the Company as one source for both their direct-to-store business and their warehouse business. We generally have significantly lower gross profit margins on sales to customers' warehouses as we pass much of the efficiency of this low cost-to-serve model on to the customer. These sales do, however, contribute to our gross profit dollars.29Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The customer mix of revenues from our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business was as follows: Years Ended March 31, 2013 2012 2011Direct Sales Retail Chains33% 34% 33%Institutions37 34 34 Independents11 11 12 Subtotal81 79 79 Sales to retail customers' warehouses19 21 21 Total100% 100% 100%As previously described, a limited number of our large retail chain customers purchase products through both our direct and warehouse distribution methods, the latter of which generally has a significantly lower gross profit margin due to the low cost-to-serve model. When evaluating and pricing customer contracts, we do so based on our assessment of total customer profitability. As a result, we do not evaluate our performance or allocate resources based on sales to customers' warehouses or gross profit associated with such sales.Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues decreased 3% in 2013 compared to 2012. Excluding an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 1%, revenues decreased primarily due to five less sales days, government-imposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces and changes in our customer mix. These decreases were partially offset by market growth and an increase in revenues associated with our March 2012 acquisition of the assets of Drug Trading Company Limited, the independent banner business of the Katz Group Canada Inc. (“Katz Group”), and Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc., the franchise business of the Katz Group (collectively, “Katz Assets”). Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 5% in 2012 compared to 2011. Excluding a favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation of 2% during 2012, revenues increased primarily due to market growth, five additional sales days and a small acquisition in the second quarter of 2011, partially offset by government-imposed price reduction for generic pharmaceuticals in certain provinces. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to market growth, new customers and our February 22, 2013 acquisition of PSS World Medical, Inc. (“PSS World Medical”). These increases were partially offset by five less sales days. Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to market growth, new customers and five additional sales days.Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to acquisitions, higher volume of claims processing and an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers, partially offset by revenue deferral on certain products in our international business. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher revenues for claims processing, increased revenues associated with the sale and installation of our software products, an increase in maintenance revenues from new and existing customers and a number of small acquisitions made during 2012. 30Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2013 2012 2011 2013 2012Gross Profit Distribution Solutions (1)$5,439 $5,057 $4,565 8% 11%Technology Solutions (2)1,545 1,510 1,405 2 7 Total$6,984 $6,567 $5,970 6 10 Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions4.57% 4.23% 4.19% 34bp 4bp Technology Solutions45.43 45.62 43.97 (19) 165 Total5.70 5.35 5.33 35 2 bp - basis points(1)Gross profit for our Distribution Solutions segment for 2013 and 2011 includes receipt of $44 million and $51 million representing our share of settlements of antitrust class action lawsuits brought against drug manufacturers, which were recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.(2)Gross profit for our Technology Solutions segment for 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes an asset impairment charge for capitalized software held for sale of $10 million, $31 million of product alignment charges and a $72 million asset impairment charge for capitalized software held for sale.Gross profit increased 6% to $7.0 billion in 2013 and 10% to $6.6 billion in 2012. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 35 bp in 2013 and by 2 bp in 2012. Gross profit margin increased in 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in our Distribution Solutions segment. Gross profit margin increased in 2012 reflecting increases in both of our operating segments.Distribution Solutions segment's gross profit margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to increased sales of higher margin generic drugs, our business acquisitions, an increase in buy margin and a lower proportion of revenues within the segment attributed to sales to customers' warehouses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sell margin. Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Our Distribution Solutions segment's gross profit margin for 2013 was also favorably affected by the receipt of $44 million representing our share of settlements of antitrust class action lawsuits brought against drug manufacturers.Distribution Solutions segment's gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to our acquisition of US Oncology and increased sales of higher margin generic drugs, partially offset by a decline in sell margin and the receipt of $51 million in 2011 representing our share of a settlement of an antitrust class action lawsuit brought against a drug manufacturer. Our last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) net inventory expense was $13 million in 2013, $11 million in 2012 and $3 million for 2011. Our Distribution Solutions segment uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The practice in the Distribution Solutions segment's distribution businesses is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. During 2013 and 2012, we began to experience a modest net inflationary trend in our pharmaceuticals indices, as price increases on branded pharmaceuticals exceeded the impact of price declines and shifts toward generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” included in this Financial Review.Technology Solutions segment's gross profit margin decreased in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a change in product and services mix and a $10 million impairment of capitalized software held for sale. Additionally, 2012 gross profit margin includes $31 million of product alignment charges.Technology Solutions segment's gross profit margin increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due an increase in higher margin revenues, a $72 million asset impairment charge related to our Horizon Enterprise ManagementTM (“HzERM”) software product in 2011 and lower amortization expense related to HzERM. These increases were partially offset by product alignment charges of $31 million in 2012.31Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)During the third quarter of 2012, we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within our Technology Solutions segment. As part of this alignment strategy, we began converging our core clinical and revenue cycle Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon's Microsoft®-based platform. Additionally, we stopped development of our HzERM software product. The plan resulted in a pre-tax charge of $51 million in 2012, of which $31 million was recorded to cost of sales and $20 million was recorded to operating expenses within our Technology Solutions segment. The majority of these charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2012. The pre-tax charge included $24 million of non-cash asset impairment charges, primarily for the write-off of prepaid licenses and commissions and capitalized internal use software that were determined to be obsolete as they would not be utilized going forward, $10 million for severance, $7 million for customer allowances and $10 million for other charges. Our capitalized software held for sale is amortized over three years. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. At the end of the second quarter of 2010, our HzERM software product became generally available. In October 2010, we decreased our estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our HzERM software product and, as a result, concluded that the estimated future revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a $72 million non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011 within our Technology Solutions segment's cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of the software product to its net realizable value.

Operating expenses increased in 2013 primarily due to our business acquisitions, higher employee compensation and benefit costs, a $40 million charge for a legal dispute in our Canadian business and a $36 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge. These increases were partially offset by an $81 million gain on business combination and lower AWP litigation charges. Operating expenses increased in 2012 primarily due to the addition of US Oncology, higher employee compensation and benefits costs and an increase in expenses associated with supporting higher revenues, partially offset by lower AWP litigation charges. Operating expenses include pre-tax charges of $72 million, $149 million and $213 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011 relating to our AWP litigation. 32Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Acquisition expenses and related adjustments, which include transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to acquisitions by the Company and gains and losses related to business combinations were $2 million, $31 million and $52 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Expenses for 2013 primarily consist of charges incurred to acquire and integrate PSS World Medical; these expenses were almost fully offset by an $81 million gain on business combination.

These increases were partially offset by lower AWP litigation charges. Additionally, this ratio is negatively impacted as a result of decreases in revenue resulting from deflation.Distribution Solutions segment's operating expenses increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflecting the addition of US Oncology, higher employee compensation and benefits expenses and an increase in expenses associated with supporting higher revenues, partially offset by a lower AWP litigation charge. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to operating leverage and lower AWP litigation charge, partially offset by the addition of US Oncology.The Company has a reserve relating to AWP public entity claims, which is reviewed at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate changes, including consideration of the pace and progress of discussions relating to potentially resolving other public entity claims. The following is the activity related to the AWP litigation reserve for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: Years Ended March 31,(In millions)2013 2012 2011AWP Litigation reserve at beginning of period$453 $330 $143Charges incurred72 149 213Payments made(483) (26) (26)AWP litigation reserve at end of period$42 $453 $330Pre-tax charges relating to changes in the Company's AWP litigation reserve, including accrued interest, are recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment. The charges for 2013 primarily related to state Medicaid claims. The charges for 2012 primarily related to the Douglas County, Kansas Action settlement and the state and federal Medicaid claims. The charges for 2011 primarily related to state and federal Medicaid claims. In view of the number of outstanding cases and expected future claims, and the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserve.Since 2009 the Company has cooperated with and responded to an investigation by the Regie de l'assurance maladie du Quebec (“RAMQ”), a provincial government agency with administrative authority over the conduct of pharmaceutical businesses in the province of Quebec, Canada. The investigation focused on certain discounts and payments offered to pharmacies in Quebec, as well as payments received by the Company from certain manufacturers. In the third quarter of 2013, we engaged in settlement discussions to resolve potential legal claims against the Company and its customers and suppliers arising from the investigation. In consideration of the pace and progress of settlement discussions, in the third quarter of 2013, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $40 million for estimated probable loss from potential legal claims arising from the investigation. The charge was recorded to operating expenses within our Distribution Solutions segment. On April 19, 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the RAMQ, to settle all potential claims of the RAMQ arising from the investigation. The agreement provides that the Company will pay $40 million to the RAMQ, and provides for a full release of all potential claims by the RAMQ arising from the investigation. Refer to Financial Note 22, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.Technology Solutions segment's operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to our continued investment in research and development activities, a $36 million goodwill impairment charge and business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by product alignment charges of $20 million incurred in 2012. 34Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded $46 million of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges in our Technology Solutions segment. These charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. The charge included a $36 million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value. In addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis. This impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. The balance of the charge represents a $10 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value. We concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations.Technology Solutions segment's operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to our continued investment in research and development activities, a number of small business acquisitions in 2012 and product alignment charges of $20 million. These increases were partially offset by cost containment efforts. Corporate expenses decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the gain on business combination and a charitable contribution in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in a reserve for an environmental liability, acquisition-related expenses and other corporate initiatives. Corporate expenses for 2012 increased compared to 2011 primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits costs and a charitable contribution.

(""Nadro"") and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191 million reducing the investment's carrying value to its estimated fair value. The charge reflects deterioration in Nadro's market position, projected lower revenue growth rates and operating margins and continued business challenges in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution business in Mexico. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $69 million were included in the assessment of the investment's carrying value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses (net of tax), are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on our consolidated balance sheet. The charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment. The ultimate selling price of our investment in Nadro may be different than our current assessment of fair value. The fair value of the investment will be reviewed quarterly for any additional impairment. 35Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Segment Operating Profit and Corporate Expenses, Net: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2013 2012 2011 2013 2012Segment Operating Profit (1) Distribution Solutions (2) (3) (4) (5)$2,197 $2,219 $1,897 (1)% 17%Technology Solutions (6) (7) (8)297 364 301 (18) 21 Subtotal2,494 2,583 2,198 (3) 18 Corporate Expenses, Net (9)(335) (413) (341) (19) 21 Interest Expense(240) (251) (222) (4) 13 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes$1,919 $1,919 $1,635 — 17 Segment Operating Profit Margin Distribution Solutions1.85%1.86%1.74% (1)bp 12bp Technology Solutions8.73 11.00 9.42 (227) 158 (1)Segment operating profit includes gross profit, net of operating expenses, plus other income (expense), net for our two operating segments.(2)Operating profit for 2013 includes a $191 million charge for impairment of our equity investment in Nadro.(3)Operating profit for 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes AWP litigation charges of $72 million, $149 million and $213 million.

These increases were partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin and lower AWP litigation charges. Operating profit margin for our Distribution Solutions segment increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to higher gross profit margin, which included a full year of results from US Oncology, and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which included lower AWP litigation charges. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and a decrease in gross profit margin. Operating profit margin in our Technology Solutions segment increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflecting an increase in gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Corporate expenses, net of other income decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the gain on business combination and an increase in other income. Corporate expenses, net of other income increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due an increase in operating expenses and a decrease in other income. Interest Expense: Interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to the repayment of $400 million of long-term debt in February 2012, partially offset by $11 million of bridge loan fees paid in connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical. Interest expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to $1.7 billion of long-term debt issued in February 2011 in connection with our acquisition of US Oncology. Refer to our discussion under the caption “Credit Resources” within this Financial Review for additional information regarding our financing activities. 36Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Income Taxes: Our reported income tax rates were 30.3%, 26.9% and 30.9% in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, income tax expense included $29 million, $66 million and $34 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items, which primarily relates to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest. Included in the 2012 discrete tax benefit is a $31 million credit to income tax expense as a result of the reversal of an income tax reserve relating to our AWP litigation.We have received tax assessments of $98 million from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) relating to 2003 through 2006. We disagree with a substantial portion of the tax assessments primarily relating to transfer pricing. We are pursuing administrative relief through the appeals process. We have also received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for a total of $199 million related to transfer pricing for 2003 through 2008. Payments of most of the assessments to the CRA have been made to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003 to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004 through 2007, and are in the process of filing a notice of objection for 2008. The trial between McKesson Canada Corporation and the CRA, argued in the Tax Court of Canada, concluded in early February 2012, and we are waiting for the decision. We continue to believe in the merits of our tax positions and that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to these examinations in our financial statements. However, the final resolution of these issues could result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense.Discontinued Operation: In July 2010, our Technology Solutions segment sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, MAP, a provider of phone and web-based healthcare services in Australia and New Zealand, for net sales proceeds of $109 million. The divestiture generated a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $95 million and $72 million. As a result of the sale, we were able to utilize capital loss carry-forwards for which we previously recorded a valuation allowance of $15 million. The release of the valuation allowance is included as a tax benefit in our after-tax gain on the divestiture. The after-tax gain on disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statement of operations in 2011. The historical financial operating results and net assets of MAP were not material to our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Net Income: Net income was $1,338 million, $1,403 million and $1,202 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011 and diluted earnings per common share were $5.59, $5.59 and $4.57. Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2013, 2012 and 2011 include after-tax AWP litigation charges of $45 million, $60 million and $149 million, or $0.19, $0.24 and $0.57 per diluted common share. Net income and diluted earnings per common share for 2011 also included an after-tax gain of $72 million, or $0.28 per diluted share relating to our sale of MAP. Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 239 million, 251 million and 263 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011. The decreases in the number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding primarily reflect the cumulative effect of share repurchases over the past three years, partially offset by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards.International OperationsInternational operations accounted for 8.3%, 8.6% and 8.9% of 2013, 2012 and 2011 consolidated revenues. International operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our international operations is also included in Financial Note 25, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.37Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Business CombinationsFiscal 2013In addition to our April 2012 acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California, on February 22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of PSS World Medical, Inc. (“PSS World Medical”) of Jacksonville, Florida for $29.00 per share plus the assumption of PSS World Medical's debt, or approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate, consisting of cash consideration of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of long-term debt with a fair value of $0.6 billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of long-term debt. PSS World Medical markets and distributes medical products and services throughout the United States. The acquisition of PSS World Medical expands our existing Medical-Surgical business. Financial results for PSS World Medical since the acquisition date are included in the results of operations for the fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2013 within our Medical-Surgical distributions and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment.Fiscal 2012On March 25, 2012, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Drug Trading Company Limited, the independent banner business of the Katz Group Canada Inc. (“Katz Group”), and Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc., the franchise business of the Katz Group (collectively, “Katz Assets”) for $925 million, which was funded from cash on hand. The acquisition of the assets from the Drug Trading Company Limited consists of a marketing and purchasing arm of independently owned pharmacies in Canada. The acquisition of Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc. consists of the franchise business of providing services to independent pharmacies in Canada. Financial results for the acquired Katz Assets have been included in the results of operations within our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, beginning in the first quarter of 2013.Fiscal 2011On December 30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Oncology for approximately $2.1 billion, consisting of cash consideration of $0.2 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of liabilities with a fair value of $1.9 billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand. As an integrated oncology company, US Oncology is affiliated with community-based oncologists, and works with patients, hospitals, payers and the medical industry across all phases of the cancer research and delivery continuum. The acquisition of US Oncology expands our existing specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and adds practice management services for oncologists. Financial results for US Oncology have been included in the results of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 14, “Business Combinations” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.2014 OutlookInformation regarding the Company's 2014 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 7, 2013. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.38Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers' financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2013, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Caremark Corporation (""CVS""), accounted for approximately 17% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2013, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 44% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (""Walmart"") were approximately 16% and 10% of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2013 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue.At March 31, 2013, trade and notes receivables were $8,853 million prior to allowances of $121 million. In 2013, 2012 and 2011 our provision for bad debts was $28 million, $30 million and $18 million. At March 31, 2013 and 2012, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.4% and 1.3%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2013 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $9 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $10.3 billion and $10.1 billion at March 31, 2013 and 2012. 39Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The LIFO method was used to value approximately 80% and 88% of our inventories at March 31, 2013 and 2012. At March 31, 2013 and 2012, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $120 million and $107 million. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized net LIFO expense of $13 million, $11 million and $3 million within our consolidated statements of operations, which related to our non-pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. Primarily due to historical net deflation in our pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $60 million and $76 million higher than market as of March 31, 2013 and 2012. As a result, we recorded a LCM credit of $16 million and $80 million in 2013 and 2012 within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market. During 2013 and 2012, we began to experience a modest net inflationary trend in our pharmaceuticals indices, as price increases on branded pharmaceuticals exceeded the impact of price declines and shifts toward generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. In 2014, we expect this trend to continue. As a result, we may recognize an increase in net LIFO expense in 2014.In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories, which are considered excess and obsolete, as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $6,405 million and $5,032 million of goodwill at March 31, 2013 and 2012 and $2,270 million and $1,750 million of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2013 and 2012. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. 40Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services, customers and operating margin are aggregated as a single reporting unit. Management judgment is involved in determining which components may be combined and changes in these combinations could affect the outcome of the testing. The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangibles assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units' fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $36 million in our Technology Solutions segment. In 2012 and 2011, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Currently, all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to twenty years. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. There were no material impairments of intangibles in 2013, 2012 or 2011. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.41Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, supplier reserves were $164 million and $115 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2013 and 2012 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2013 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $16 million in 2013. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,247 million and $1,335 million at March 31, 2013 and 2012 and deferred tax liabilities of $3,114 million and $2,495 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and other assets. We established valuation allowances of $118 million and $101 million for 2013 and 2012 against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to federal, state and foreign loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized.If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $19 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for 2013. Share-Based Compensation: Our compensation programs include share-based compensation. We account for all share-based compensation transactions using a fair-value based measurement method. The share-based compensation expense, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. 42Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)We estimate the grant-date fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. Our estimates of employee stock option values rely on assumptions we input into the model. The key assumptions involve estimates of future uncertain events. The key assumptions influencing the fair value estimates, among others, are the expected life of the option, the expected stock price volatility and the expected dividend yield. In determining the expected life of the option, we primarily use historical experience as our best estimate of future exercise patterns. We use a combination of historical and implied market volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility factor. We believe that the combination of both historical and implied volatility provides a reasonable estimate of our future stock price movements. Once the fair values of employee stock options are determined, accounting requirements do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual experience.In addition, we develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a material effect on share-based compensation expense. If the actual forfeiture rate materially differs from the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment is made to revise the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase or decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. We re-assess the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the requisite service period. Forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than our current estimates.Our assessments of estimated share-based compensation expense are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These variables include the volatility of our stock price, employee stock option exercise behavior, timing, number and types of annual share-based awards, the attainment of performance goals and the forfeiture rates. As a result, future share-based compensation expense may differ from the Company's historical amounts.Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facility, revolving credit facility and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time-to-time. Net cash flow from operating activities was $2,483 million in 2013 compared to $2,950 million in 2012 and $2,338 million in 2011. Operating activities for 2013 were primarily affected by $483 million of payments made for AWP litigation settlements.43Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Operating activities for 2012 reflect an increase in drafts and accounts payable primarily associated with longer payment terms for certain purchases, partially offset by an increase in receivables and higher inventories primarily associated with revenue growth. Operating activities for 2011 reflect an increase in receivables primarily associated with revenue growth, partially offset by improved management of inventories and longer payment terms for certain purchases.Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors.Net cash used in investing activities was $2,209 million in 2013 compared to $1,502 million in 2012 and $624 million in 2011. Investing activities for 2013 included $1,873 million of cash payments for acquisitions, including $1,299 million for our acquisition of PSS World Medical. Investing activities in 2013 also included $246 million and $160 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2012 included $1,156 million of cash payments for acquisitions, including $919 million for our acquisition of the Katz Assets. Investing activities in 2012 also included $225 million and $178 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Investing activities for 2011 included $292 million of cash payments for acquisitions, including $244 million for our acquisition of US Oncology, and $109 million of cash received from the sale of MAP. Investing activities in 2011 also included $233 million and $155 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Financing activities utilized cash of $956 million in 2013 compared to $1,905 million in 2012 and $1,841 million in 2011. Financing activities for 2013 include cash receipts of $1,325 million and cash paid of $1,725 million from short-term borrowings. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical, we borrowed $900 million for bridge financing in February 2013, which was fully repaid in March 2013. Financing activities for 2013 also include cash receipts of $1,798 million for the issuance of long-term debt and cash paid of $1,143 million for repayments of long-term debt. In December 2012, we issued $500 million of 0.95% Notes due 2015 and $400 million of 2.70% Notes due 2022. In March 2013, we issued $500 million of 1.40% Notes due 2018 and $400 million of 2.85% Notes dues 2023. Long-term debt repayments include $500 million paid on the maturity of our 5.25% Notes due in March 2013 and $635 million paid to redeem the debt acquired on the acquisition of PSS World Medical. Additionally, financing activities for 2013 included $1,214 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $194 million of dividends paid.Financing activities for 2012 included $1,874 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $400 million of cash paid on the maturity of our 7.75% Notes in February 2012, $195 million of dividends paid, $400 million of cash receipts from secured borrowings and $167 million of cash receipts from employees' exercises of stock options. Financing activities for 2011 reflect $1,689 million of cash received from the issuance of long-term debt. In February 2011, we issued $600 million of 3.25% notes due 2016, $600 million of 4.75% notes due 2021, and $500 million of 6.00% notes due 2041. Net proceeds from the issuance of the long-term notes, after discounts and offering expenses, were used to pay off the $1,730 million of debt assumed as part of the acquisition of US Oncology. Also as part of our acquisition of US Oncology, we borrowed $1,000 million for bridge financing which was fully repaid by February 2011. Financing activities for 2011 also included $2,050 million of cash paid for share repurchases, $171 million of cash paid for dividends and $367 million of cash receipts from employees' exercises of stock options.The Company's Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson's common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. 44Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The Board authorized the repurchase of the Company's common stock as follows: $1.0 billion in April 2010, $1.0 billion in October 2010, $1.0 billion in April 2011, $650 million in January 2012, $700 million in April 2012 and $500 million in January 2013. Total share repurchases transacted through ASR programs and open market transactions over the last three years were as follows: Years Ended March 31,(In millions, except per share data)2013 2012 2011Number of shares repurchased (1)13 20 29Average price paid per share$100.82 $83.47 $69.62Total value of shares repurchased (1)$1,159 $1,850 $2,032(1)Excludes shares surrendered for tax withholding.The total authorization outstanding for repurchases of the Company's common stock was $340 million at March 31, 2013.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired 1.8 million shares repurchased for $217 million by the Company. The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. As such, $195 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings.We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions)2013 2012 2011Cash and cash equivalents$2,456 $3,149 $3,612 Working capital1,813 1,917 3,631 Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents2,417 831 392 Debt to capital ratio (1)40.8% 36.8% 35.7%Net debt to net capital employed (2)25.5 10.8 5.1 Return on stockholders' equity (3)18.3 19.7 16.9 (1)Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders’ equity.(2)Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (“net debt”), divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders’ equity (“net capital employed”).(3)Ratio is computed as net income for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of stockholders’ equity.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian government securities, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury bonds, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. Deposits at U.S. banks exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2013 included approximately $1.5 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. During the fourth quarter of 2011 and pursuant to IRS regulations, we temporarily borrowed and repaid $1.0 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside the United States. The duration of this temporary loan to the United States was less than 60 days.45Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2013 compared to March 31, 2012 primarily due to decrease in cash and cash equivalents balance. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2012 compared to March 31, 2011, primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories.Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2013 compared to March 31, 2012 primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalents balance. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2012 compared to March 31, 2011 primarily due to a lower cash and cash equivalents balance.In April 2011, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.18 to $0.20 per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board. Dividends were $0.80 per share in 2013 and 2012, and $0.72 per share in 2011. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company's future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, we paid total cash dividends of $194 million, $195 million and $171 million.Contractual Obligations:The table below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2013: Years(In millions)Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5On balance sheet Long-term debt (1)$4,873 $352 $1,101 $1,001 $2,419Other (2)465 27 203 79 156 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3)1,841 200 353 280 1,008Purchase obligations (4)473 423 50 — —Operating lease obligations (5) 851 213 283 153 202Other (6)280 153 78 1 48Total$8,783 $1,368 $2,068 $1,514 $3,833(1)Represents maturities of the Company's long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations.

Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table.In addition, at March 31, 2013, our banks and insurance companies have issued $98 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers' compensation and automotive liability programs. 46Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents, as well as short-term borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facility, revolving credit facility and from commercial paper issuances. Senior Bridge Term Loan FacilityIn connection with our acquisition of PSS World Medical, in December 2012 we entered into a $2.1 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (“2013 Bridge Loan”). In February 2013, we reduced the 2013 Bridge Loan commitment to $900 million. On February 22, 2013, we borrowed $900 million under the 2013 Bridge Loan. The proceeds from the 2013 Bridge Loan and our existing cash on hand were used to redeem the assumed debt from PSS World Medical and pay the equity shareholders of PSS World Medical. On March 8, 2013, we repaid the 2013 Bridge Loan with the funds obtained from the issuance of long-term debt and the 2013 Bridge Term Loan Agreement was terminated. During the time it was outstanding, the 2013 Bridge Loan balance bore interest of 1.20% per annum, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company's credit rating. Corporate interest expense for 2013 includes $11 million related to fees incurred on the 2013 Bridge Loan. In connection with our execution of an agreement to acquire US Oncology, in November 2010 we entered into a $2.0 billion unsecured Senior Bridge Term Loan Agreement (“2011 Bridge Loan”). In December 2010, we reduced the 2011 Bridge Loan commitment to $1.0 billion. On January 31, 2011, we borrowed $1.0 billion under the 2011 Bridge Loan. On February 28, 2011, we repaid the 2011 Bridge Loan with the funds obtained from the issuance of long-term debt and the 2011 Bridge Term Loan Agreement was terminated. During the time it was outstanding, the 2011 Bridge Loan bore interest of 1.76% per annum, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin based on the Company's credit rating. Corporate Interest expense for 2011 includes $25 million related to fees incurred on the 2011 Bridge Loan.PSS World Medical Debt AcquiredUpon our purchase of PSS World Medical in February 2013, we assumed the outstanding debt of PSS World Medical. Prior to our acquisition, PSS World Medical called for redemption of all its outstanding 6.375% Senior Notes due 2022. Due to the change in control provisions of the 3.125% Senior Convertible Notes due 2014, the notes were convertible to cash at the option of the note holders. All the note holders opted to receive cash. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we redeemed both of these notes, including accrued interest for $643 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our 2013 Bridge Loan.US Oncology Debt AcquiredUpon our purchase of US Oncology in December 2010, we assumed the outstanding debt of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary US Oncology, Inc. Immediately prior to our acquisition, US Oncology Holdings, Inc. called for redemption of all of its outstanding Senior Unsecured Floating Rate Toggle Notes due 2012 and US Oncology, Inc. called for redemption of all of its outstanding 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 and 10.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we paid interest of $50 million and redeemed these notes, including the remaining accrued interest for $1,738 million using cash on hand and borrowings under our 2011 Bridge Loan.Long-Term DebtOn March 8, 2013, we issued 1.40% notes due March 15, 2018 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million and 2.85% notes due March 15, 2023 in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million. Interest on these notes is payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning on September 15, 2013. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $891 million from the issuance of these notes to repay borrowings under the 2013 Bridge Loan.On December 4, 2012, we issued 0.95% notes due December 4, 2015 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (“Notes due 2015”) and 2.70% notes due December 15, 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million (“Notes due 2022”). Interest on the Notes due 2015 is payable on June 4 and December 4 of each year beginning on June 4, 2013 and on the Notes due 2022 is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year beginning on June 15, 2013. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $892 million from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes and replenishing working capital that was used to repay long-term debt that matured in February 2012 and in March 2013.47Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)On February 28, 2011, we issued 3.25% notes due March 1, 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million, 4.75% notes due on March 1, 2021 in an aggregate principal amount of $600 million and 6.00% notes dues March 1, 2041 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. Interest on these notes is paid on March 1 and September 1 of each year. We utilized net proceeds, after discounts and offering expenses, of $1,673 million from the issuance of these notes for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the 2011 Bridge Loan.We repaid our $500 million 5.25% Notes on March 1, 2013 and our $400 million 7.75% Notes on February 1, 2012, both of which had matured.Accounts Receivable Sales FacilityIn May 2012, we renewed our existing accounts receivable sales facility (the “Facility”) for a one year period under terms substantially similar to those previously in place. The committed balance of the Facility is $1.35 billion, although from time-to-time, the available amount of the Facility may be less than $1.35 billion based on accounts receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements. The renewed Facility will expire in May 2013. We anticipate extending or renewing the Facility before its expiration.There were no borrowings in 2011 under the Facility. During 2012, we borrowed $400 million under the Facility. At March 31, 2012, there were $400 million in secured borrowings and $400 million of related securitized accounts receivable outstanding under the Facility, which are included in short-term borrowings and receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. During the first quarter of 2013, these short-term borrowings were repaid using cash on hand. In addition, during 2013, we borrowed a total of $1,325 million under the Facility, all of which was repaid during the year using cash on hand. At March 31, 2013, there were no secured borrowings and related securitized accounts receivable outstanding under the Facility.Revolving Credit FacilityIn September 2011, we renewed our existing syndicated $1.3 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This renewed credit facility has terms and conditions substantially similar to those previously in place and matures in September 2016. Borrowings under this renewed credit facility bear interest based upon either the London Interbank Offered Rate or a prime rate. There were no borrowings under this credit facility during 2013, 2012 and 2011. As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Commercial PaperThere were no commercial paper issuances during 2013, 2012 and 2011 and no amounts outstanding at March 31, 2013 and 2012. Debt CovenantsOur various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 56.5%. For the purpose of calculating this ratio, borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facility are excluded. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March 31, 2013, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. A reduction in our credit ratings, or the lack of compliance with our covenants, could negatively impact our ability to finance operations or issue additional debt at acceptable interest rates.Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. Additional information regarding our accounts receivable sales facility is included in Financial Notes 1 and 14, “Significant Accounting Policies” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.48Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 24, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by a hypothetical 50 bp in 2013, interest expense would not have been materially different from that reported. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. Should interest rates decline, our interest income may be negatively impacted. If the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents balances changed by 50 bp in 2013, interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately $12 million. The selected hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.As of March 31, 2013 and 2012, the net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $5.5 billion and $4.1 billion. The estimated fair value of our long-term debt and other financing was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Fair value is subject to fluctuations based on our performance, our credit ratings, changes in the value of our stock and changes in interest rates for debt securities with similar terms. Foreign exchange risk: We record revenues and earnings from Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, other European countries, Israel and Mexico, which exposes us to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency investments and loans. As of March 31, 2013, a hypothetical adverse 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our net fair value of financial instruments that have exposure to foreign currency risk. 49Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:34.415724

(“PSSI”), as well as due to market growth and our mix of business. Market growth reflects growing drug utilization, which includes newly launched drugs and price increases. Increases in revenues were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. Gross profit and gross profit margin increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions, higher buy margin and our mix of business, partially offset by a decrease in sell margin. Additionally, gross profit was impacted by higher LIFO-related inventory charges which were $337 million, $311 million and $13 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Operating expenses increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and higher intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. Operating expenses in 2015 also included a pre-tax and after-tax $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and various U.S. Attorney’s offices, and in 2014 and 2013 operating expenses included $68 million and $72 million of charges associated with our Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”) litigation. Additionally, operating expenses for 2013 were favorably impacted by an $81 million non-cash gain on a business combination related to our purchase of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building. 30Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased over the last two years reflecting higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating and interest expenses. Interest expense increased in 2015 primarily due to our acquisition of Celesio. Additionally, income from continuing operations in 2013 included a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $191 million associated with the sale of our 49% equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V (“Nadro”). The impairment reduced the investment’s carrying value to its estimated fair value. Nadro was sold in 2014 with no material gain or loss on disposition. Our reported income tax rates were 30.7%, 34.9% and 30.1% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Income tax expense for 2014 included a charge of $122 million relating to our litigation with the Canadian Revenue Agency (“CRA”). During the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business which we acquired through our acquisition of Celesio. Financial results for this business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2015 includes $241 million pre-tax ($235 million after-tax) non-cash impairment charges to write-off the business’ long-lived assets and reduce the carrying value of this business to its fair value, less costs to sell.Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2014 included a non-cash pre-tax and after-tax impairment charge of $80 million related to our International Technology business, which was sold in part in 2015.Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015 primarily reflects the $62 million of guaranteed dividends and recurring compensation that McKesson is obligated to pay the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”), which became effective in December 2014 as further described below. Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $1,476 million, $1,263 million and $1,338 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from continuing operations were $7.54, $6.08 and $5.69 and diluted loss per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from discontinued operations were $1.27, $0.67 and $0.10 in 2015, 2014 and 2013.On February 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of Celesio and certain convertible bonds of Celesio for cash consideration of $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired (the “Acquisition”). Upon the Acquisition, as required, we consolidated Celesio’s debt with a fair value of $2.3 billion as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and our ownership of Celesio’s fully diluted common shares was 75.6%. We owned approximately 75.4% of Celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares at March 31, 2014. Financial results for Celesio are included within our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, since the date of Acquisition.On May 22, 2014, Celesio and McKesson, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Deutschland GmbH & Co. KGaA (“McKesson Deutschland,” formerly known as Dragonfly GmbH & Co. KGaA), entered into the Domination Agreement. On July 15, 2014, the Domination Agreement was approved at the general shareholders’ meeting of Celesio. On December 2, 2014, the Domination Agreement became effective upon its registration in the commercial register of Celesio at the local court of Stuttgart, Germany. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement, the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio no longer participate in their percentage ownership of Celesio’s profits and losses. Instead, McKesson became obligated to pay a one-time $50 million dividend (“Guaranteed Dividend”) for their fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per Celesio share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio. The recurring compensation amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. For fiscal 2016, the estimated annual recurring compensation is $44 million based on the Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate and shares owned by the noncontrolling interests at April 1, 2015.In addition, upon effectiveness of the Domination Agreement, the noncontrolling interests in Celesio became redeemable as a result of a put right. Accordingly, the carrying value of noncontrolling interests related to Celesio of $1.5 billion was reclassified in the third quarter of 2015 from “Total Equity” to “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests” on our consolidated balance sheet. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests will be reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. At March 31, 2015, the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests amounted to $1.4 billion, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.2 billion.31Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Revenues: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2013 2015 2014Distribution Solutions North America pharmaceutical distribution& services$143,711 $123,929 $115,443 16% 7%International pharmaceutical distribution & services26,358 4,485 — 488 — Medical-Surgical distribution & services5,907 5,648 3,603 5 57 Total Distribution Solutions175,976 134,062 119,046 31 13 Technology Solutions - products and services3,069 3,330 3,150 (8) 6 Total Revenues$179,045 $137,392 $122,196 30% 12%Revenues for 2015 increased 30% to $179.0 billion from 2014 and revenues for 2014 increased 12% to $137.4 billion from 2013. Increases in our revenues were primarily driven by our Distribution Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 98% of our consolidated revenues. Distribution SolutionsNorth America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth and our mix of business. Market growth reflects growing drug utilization, which includes newly launched drugs and price increases. In particular, our 2015 revenues benefited from newly launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C. These increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions. International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues were $26.4 billion and $4.5 billion in 2015 and 2014, representing revenues from Celesio, which was acquired in February 2014.Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth. Additionally, revenues increased in 2014 as a result of our February 2013 acquisition of PSSI. Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions revenues decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decline in software products and services revenues, the planned elimination of a product line and lower revenues from the workforce business within our International Technology business, which we will transition to another service provider during the first quarter of 2016. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume in our transaction processing businesses. Technology Solutions revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to small business acquisitions and higher volumes in our transaction processing businesses, partially offset by a decrease in software products and services revenues. 32Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Gross Profit: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2013 2015 2014Gross Profit Distribution Solutions (1)$9,937 $6,745 $5,435 47% 24%Technology Solutions1,474 1,607 1,446 (8) 11 Total$11,411 $8,352 $6,881 37% 21% Gross Profit Margin Distribution Solutions5.65% 5.03% 4.57% 62bp 46bp Technology Solutions48.03 48.26 45.90 (23) 236 Total6.37 6.08 5.63 29 45 bp - basis points(1)Gross profit for our Distribution Solutions segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes LIFO-related inventory charges of $337 million, $311 million and $13 million.

Buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Gross profit margin for 2015 was also unfavorably affected by the increased sales associated with newly launched drugs for the treatment of Hepatitis C. Gross profit margin for 2014 was also favorably affected by growth in sales of higher margin generic drugs.Our LIFO-related inventory expense was $337 million in 2015, $311 million in 2014 and $13 million in 2013. Our North American distribution business uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The business’ practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. Our annual LIFO expense is affected by expected changes in year-end inventory quantities, product mix and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be influenced by market and other external influences. Changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual LIFO expense. As a result of cumulative net price deflation, at March 31, 2013, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $60 million more than market and, accordingly, a $60 million lower-of-cost or market (“LCM”) reserve reduced inventories to market. In 2015 and 2014, we experienced net inflation in our pharmaceutical inventories and LIFO-related charges were incurred, and in 2014, the $60 million LCM reserve was fully released resulting in an increase in gross profit. As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO did not exceed market. Additional information regarding our LIFO accounting is included under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” included in this Financial Review.33Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions gross profit margin decreased in 2015 primarily due to a $34 million pre-tax charge representing a catch-up in depreciation and amortization expense not recognized in 2014 when certain assets were classified as held-for-sale and our mix of business. These decreases were partially offset by the planned elimination of a product line and lower product alignment charges. Gross profit margin increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to growth in higher margin revenues, partially offset by higher product alignment charges. In 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our International Technology and Hospital Automation businesses from our Technology Solutions segment. As required, we classified the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements in 2014 and depreciation and amortization expense was not recognized as the assets were held-for-sale. During the first quarter of 2015, we decided to retain the workforce business within our International Technology business. As a result, we reclassified the workforce business, which had been designated as a discontinued operation during 2014, as a continuing operation for all periods presented. Additionally, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $34 million as a catch-up of depreciation and amortization expense not recognized in 2014 when the assets were classified as held-for-sale. In 2014, the segment recorded pre-tax charges totaling $57 million. These charges primarily consisted of $35 million of product alignment charges, $15 million of integration-related expenses and $7 million of reduction-in-workforce severance charges. Included in the total charge was $35 million for severance for employees primarily in our research and development, customer services and sales functions, and $15 million for asset impairments which primarily represents the write-off of deferred costs for a product that will no longer be developed. Charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows: $34 million in cost of sales and $23 million in operating expenses. In 2013, this segment recorded $46 million of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges. These charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. The charge included a $36 million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value. In addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis. This impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. The balance of the charge represents a $10 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value. We concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations.Operating Expenses: Years Ended March 31, Change(Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2013 2015 2014Operating Expenses Distribution Solutions$6,938 $4,301 $3,068 61% 40%Technology Solutions1,039 1,161 1,120 (11) 4 Corporate466 451 346 3 30 Total$8,443 $5,913 $4,534 43% 30% Operating Expenses as a Percentage of Revenues Distribution Solutions3.94%3.21%2.58% 73bp 63bp Technology Solutions33.85 34.86 35.56 (101) (70) Total4.72 4.30 3.71 42 59 Operating expenses increased over the last two years primarily due to our Distribution Solutions segment, which includes our Celesio and PSSI business acquisitions.34Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Distribution SolutionsDistribution Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and higher intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. Operating expenses in 2015 also included a pre-tax and after-tax $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the DEA, DOJ and various U.S. Attorney’s offices, and 2014 and 2013 operating expenses included $68 million and $72 million of charges associated with our AWP litigation. Additionally, operating expenses for 2013 were negatively impacted by a $40 million charge for a legal dispute in our Canadian business. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the DEA, DOJ and various U.S. Attorney’s offices to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the Company’s suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances. The global settlement with the DEA and DOJ is subject to the execution of final settlement agreements. Under the terms of the agreement in principle, the Company has agreed to pay the sum of $150 million, implement certain remedial measures and the suspension of four distribution centers’ DEA registrations for the specified products and time periods. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a pre-tax and after-tax charge of $150 million in operating expenses within our Distribution Solutions segment. Refer to Financial Note 23, “Other Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the controlled substance distribution claim and the AWP litigation matter.Technology SolutionsTechnology Solutions segment’s operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2015 decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to lower research and development expenses, and integration-related expenses and severance charges recorded in 2014. The segment’s operating expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to small business acquisitions, integration-related expenses, reduction-in-workforce severance charges, and continued investment in research and development activities. These increases were partially offset by a $36 million goodwill impairment charge incurred in 2013. The segment’s operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in revenue.CorporateCorporate expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs and asset impairments, partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses and lower costs associated with corporate initiatives. Corporate expenses increased in 2014 primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs and higher acquisition-related expenses. Additionally, 2013 corporate expenses include a non-cash pre-tax gain of $81 million gain ($51 million after-tax) related to our purchase of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California. Acquisition Expenses and Related AdjustmentsAcquisition expenses and related adjustments, which include transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to acquisitions by the Company and gains and losses related to business combinations were $224 million, $218 million and $1 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Expenses for 2015 and 2014 primarily related to our acquisitions and integrations of Celesio and PSSI. Additionally, expenses for 2013 include an $81 million pre-tax gain on business combination resulting from our acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building.35Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued) Years Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2013Cost of Sales$1 $3 $—Operating Expenses Transaction closing expenses6 39 16Restructuring, severance and relocation57 43 30Outside service fees66 27 1Other94 46 24Gain on business combination— — (81)Total223 155 (10)Other Income, Net— 14 —Interest Expense - bridge loan fees— 46 11Total Acquisition Expenses and Related Adjustments$224 $218 $1Acquisition expenses and related adjustments by segment were as follows: Years Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2013Cost of Sales $1 $3 $—Operating Expenses Distribution Solutions211 120 47Technology Solutions— 15 7Corporate12 20 (64)Total223 155 (10)Corporate - Other Income, Net— 14 —Corporate - Interest Expense— 46 11Total Acquisition Expenses and Related Adjustments$224 $218 $1During 2015 and 2014, we incurred $109 million and $129 million of acquisition-related expenses for our acquisition of Celesio.

These expenses primarily include restructuring, severance and relocation expenses, employee retention incentives, outside service fees and other costs to integrate the business, and bridge loan fees. Additionally, our acquisition-related expenses for our PSSI acquisition include amounts associated with distribution center rationalization and information technology conversions to common platforms. Amortization Expenses of Acquired Intangible AssetsAmortization expenses of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with acquisitions recorded in operating expenses were $483 million, $308 million and $196 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Impairment of an Equity Investment: In 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our 49% equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. (“Nadro”) and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191 million reducing the investment’s carrying value to its estimated fair value. The charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment. In September 2013, we completed the sale of our equity interest in Nadro. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $41 million in total cash consideration resulting in no material gain or loss.

Operating profit margin for 2015 decreased from 2014 primarily due to our acquisition of Celesio and the unfavorable impact from the newly launched drugs for Hepatitis C, partially offset by our other mix of business. Operating profit margin in 2014 was flat compared to 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in gross profit margin and the $191 million impairment charge on an equity investment incurred in 2013, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which included the effects of our acquisitions. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, operating profit and operating profit margin were also impacted by $150 million, $68 million and $72 million of reserve adjustments for estimated probable losses related to our controlled substance distribution claims and Average Wholesale Price litigation. 37Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Technology Solutions: Operating profit decreased slightly in 2015 and increased in 2014 compared to the prior years. Operating profit margin increased in 2015 primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin. Operating profit margin increased in 2014 primarily due to an increase in gross profit margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, operating profit and operating profit margin were impacted by $34 million, $57 million and $46 million of charges associated with a depreciation and amortization catch-up related to the prior year, and product alignment and impairment charges. Corporate: Corporate expenses, net, increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher other income. Corporate expenses, net, for 2013 also included the $81 million gain on business combination. Interest Expense: Interest expense increased over the last two years primarily due to the March 2014 issuance of $4.1 billion of new debt to fund the acquisition of Celesio and due to interest on Celesio’s debt. Interest expense for 2014 also included $46 million of bridge loan fees associated with the initial funding of the acquisition of Celesio. Partially offsetting these increases, interest expense benefited from the repayment of term debt in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt that is repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred for bridge loan fees. Refer to our discussion under the caption “Credit Resources” within this Financial Review for additional information regarding our financing activities.Income Taxes Our reported income tax rates were 30.7%, 34.9% and 30.1% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates and discrete items. Income tax expense included net discrete tax benefits of $33 million in 2015, net discrete tax expenses of $94 million in 2014 and net discrete tax benefits of $29 million in 2013. Discrete tax expense for 2014 primarily related to a $122 million charge regarding an unfavorable decision from the Tax Court of Canada with respect to transfer pricing issues. We have received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) related to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2010, and have filed Notices of Appeal to the Tax Court of Canada for all of these years. On December 13, 2013, the Tax Court of Canada dismissed our appeal of the 2003 reassessment and we have filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal regarding this tax year. After the close of 2015, we reached an agreement in principle with the CRA to settle the transfer pricing matter for years 2003 through 2010. Since the agreement in principle did not occur within 2015, we have not reflected this potential settlement in our 2015 financial statements. We will record the final settlement amount in a subsequent quarter and do not expect it to have a material impact to income tax expense.During 2015, we reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to settle all outstanding issues relating to years 2003 through 2006 and recognized discrete tax benefits of $55 million to record previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest.Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxLosses from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $299 million, $156 million and $25 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.During the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and a small business from our Distribution Solutions segment, as well as a small business from our Technology Solutions segment. As a result, we recorded $241 million pre-tax ($235 million after-tax) non-cash impairment charges to write off the business’ long‑lived assets and reduce the carrying value of the Brazilian business to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell. The ultimate loss from the sale of the business may be higher or lower than our current assessment of the business’ fair value. In 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our International Technology and our Hospital Automation businesses from our Technology Solutions segment and certain businesses from our Distribution Solutions segment. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax and after-tax $80 million non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the International Technology business to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell. A portion of this business was sold in 2015 for nominal proceeds. Our Hospital Automation business was sold in 2014 for net cash proceeds of $55 million which approximated the business’ net book value. 38Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)As required, we classified the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015 primarily represents the $50 million guaranteed dividend and $12 million associated with the quarterly accrual of the annual recurring compensation that we are obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio under the Domination Agreement. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2014 primarily represents the portion of Celesio’s net loss that was not allocable to McKesson Corporation. Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation: Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $1,476 million, $1,263 million and $1,338 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013 and diluted earnings per common share were $6.27, $5.41 and $5.59. Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding: Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 235 million, 233 million and 239 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding is impacted by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and in 2014 the cumulative effect of share repurchases.Foreign OperationsForeign operations accounted for approximately 20%, 11% and 8% of 2015, 2014 and 2013 consolidated revenues. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is also included in Financial Note 26, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Business CombinationsFiscal 2014On February 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of Celesio AG (“Celesio”) and certain convertible bonds of Celesio for cash consideration of $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired (the “Acquisition”). Upon the Acquisition, our ownership of Celesio’s fully diluted common shares was 75.6% and, as required, we consolidated Celesio’s debt with a fair value of $2.3 billion as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. At March 31, 2014, we owned approximately 75.4% of Celesio’s outstanding and fully diluted common shares. The Acquisition was funded by utilizing a senior bridge loan, our existing accounts receivable sales facility and cash on hand. Celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and a provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. Celesio’s headquarters is in Stuttgart, Germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world. The Acquisition of Celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide. Financial results for Celesio are included within our International pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, since the date of the Acquisition.Fiscal 2013In addition to our April 2012 acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California, on February 22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of PSSI for $29.00 per share plus the assumption of PSSI’s debt, or approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate, consisting of cash consideration of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of long-term debt with a fair value of $0.6 billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of long-term debt. PSSI markets and distributes medical products and services throughout the United States. The acquisition of PSSI expanded our existing Medical-Surgical business. Financial results for PSSI since the acquisition date are included in the results of operations within our Medical-Surgical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment.39Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)During the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. Financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 15, “Business Combinations” and “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.2016 OutlookInformation regarding the Company’s 2016 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 12, 2015. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.40Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2015, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 15% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2015, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 36% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS were approximately 14% of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. A default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2015 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue.At March 31, 2015, trade and notes receivables were $13,275 million prior to allowances of $141 million. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, our provision for bad debts was $67 million, $36 million and $28 million. At March 31, 2015 and 2014, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.1% and 0.9%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2015 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $13 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”). Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories were $14.3 billion and $13.0 billion at March 31, 2015 and 2014. 41Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The LIFO method was used to value approximately 73% and 67% of our inventories at March 31, 2015 and 2014. If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately $768 million and $431 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2015 and 2014. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recognized net LIFO expense of $337 million, $311 million and $13 million within our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”). As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. Due to cumulative net price deflation from 2005 to 2013, we had a lower-of-cost or market (“LCM”) reserve of $60 million at March 31, 2013 which reduced pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO to market. During 2014, the LCM reserve of $60 million was released, resulting in an increase in gross profit. As of March 31, 2014 and 2015, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market.In determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results. Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9,817 million and $9,927 million of goodwill at March 31, 2015 and 2014 and $3,441 million and $4,871 million of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2015 and 2014. We maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component — one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.42Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangibles assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess. To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. Other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units. Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. In 2015 and 2014, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. In 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $36 million in our Technology Solutions segment.Currently, all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to thirty-eight years. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. There were no material impairments of intangibles in 2015, 2014 or 2013. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, supplier reserves were $167 million and $181 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2015 and 2014 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2015 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $25 million in 2015. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. 43Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,189 million and $1,286 million at March 31, 2015 and 2014 and deferred tax liabilities of $3,791 million and $4,075 million. Deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at LIFO) and intangible assets. We established valuation allowances of $229 million and $200 million for 2015 and 2014 against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our cash flows could be materially impacted. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.If our assumptions and estimates described above were to change, an increase/decrease of 1% in our effective tax rate as applied to income from continuing operations would have increased/decreased tax expense by approximately $27 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for 2015. Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.44Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESWe expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our accounts receivable sales facilities, revolving credit facilities and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time-to-time. Net cash flow from operating activities was $3,112 million in 2015 compared to $3,136 million in 2014 and $2,483 million in 2013. Operating activities for 2015 were affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables and inventories primarily associated with our revenue growth. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements and vendor payment terms.Operating activities for 2014 were primarily affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables and inventories primarily associated with our revenue growth. Operating activities for 2013 were primarily affected by $483 million of payments for litigation settlements.Net cash used in investing activities was $677 million in 2015 compared to $5,046 million in 2014 and $2,209 million in 2013. Investing activities for 2015 include $170 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, $376 million and $169 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software, and $15 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses.Investing activities for 2014 included $4,634 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $4,497 million for our acquisition of Celesio. Investing activities in 2014 also included $278 million and $141 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software, and $97 million of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and an equity investment.Investing activities for 2013 included $1,873 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $1,299 million for our acquisition of PSSI. Investing activities in 2013 also included $241 million and $159 million in capital expenditures for property acquisitions and capitalized software. Financing activities utilized $968 million of cash in 2015, generated net cash of $3,619 million in 2014 and utilized $956 million of cash in 2013. Financing activities for 2015 include cash receipts of $3,100 million and payments of $3,152 million from short-term borrowings. Long-term debt repayments in 2015 were primarily cash paid on promissory notes. Financing activities in 2015 also reflect a cash payment of $32 million to acquire approximately 1 million additional common shares of Celesio through the tender offers we completed in 2015. Additionally, financing activities for 2015 include $340 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $227 million of dividends paid. Financing activities for 2014 include cash receipts of $6,080 million and cash paid of $6,132 million from short-term borrowings, which includes $4,957 million in borrowings under a senior bridge loan facility in connection with our acquisition of Celesio and $400 million under our accounts receivable sales facility in February 2014. These borrowings were fully repaid in March 2014. Financing activities for 2014 also include cash receipts of $4,124 million from the issuance of long-term debt in March 2014 and cash paid of $348 million for repayments of long-term debt, primarily consisting of $350 million paid on the maturity of our 6.50% Notes due in February 2014. Additionally, financing activities for 2014 included $130 million of cash payments for stock repurchases and $214 million of dividends paid.Financing activities for 2013 included cash receipts of $1,325 million and cash paid of $1,725 million from short-term borrowings. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of PSSI, we borrowed $900 million for bridge financing in February 2013, which was fully repaid in March 2013. Financing activities for 2013 also include cash receipts of $1,798 million for the issuance of long-term debt and cash paid of $1,143 million for repayments of long-term debt. In December 2012, we issued $500 million of 0.95% Notes due 2015 and $400 million of 2.70% Notes due 2022. In March 2013, we issued $500 million of 1.40% Notes due 2018 and $400 million of 2.85% Notes due 2023. Long-term debt repayments include $500 million paid on the maturity of our 5.25% Notes due in March 2013 and $635 million paid to redeem the debt acquired on the acquisition of PSSI. Additionally, financing activities for 2013 included $1,214 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $194 million of dividends paid.45Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions. The Board authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s common stock in January 2013. In 2015 and 2013, we repurchased 1.5 million and 13 million of our shares through an ASR program and open market repurchases: Years Ended March 31,(In millions, except per share data)2015 2014 2013Number of shares repurchased (1)1.5 — 13Average price paid per share$226.55 $— $100.82Total value of shares repurchased (1)$340 $— $1,159(1)Excludes shares surrendered for tax withholding.At March 31, 2015, no authorized amounts remain available for future repurchases of the Company’s common stock under the January 2013 Board approved share purchase plan.In May 2015, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s common stock.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired approximately 2 million shares repurchased for $217 million by the Company. The retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. We elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. As such, $195 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings.We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.Selected Measures of Liquidity and Capital Resources: March 31, (Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2013Cash and cash equivalents$5,341 $4,193 $2,456 Working capital3,173 3,221 1,813 Debt, net of cash and cash equivalents4,503 6,401 2,417 Debt to capital ratio (1)55.2% 55.4% 40.8%Net debt to net capital employed (2)36.0 42.9 25.5 Return on McKesson stockholders’ equity (3)17.0 16.2 18.3 (1)Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests.(2)Ratio is computed as total debt, net of cash and cash equivalents (“net debt”), divided by the sum of net debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests (“net capital employed”).(3)Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, AAA rated prime money market funds denominated in Euros, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.46Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Our cash and equivalents balance as of March 31, 2015 included approximately $2.3 billion of cash held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our primary intent is to utilize this cash in foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so could subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2015 compared to March 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable, partially offset by increases in receivables and inventories. Consolidated working capital increased at March 31, 2014 compared to March 31, 2013 primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents and increases in receivables and inventories partially offset by increases in current portion of long-term debt associated with our acquisition of Celesio. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed decreased at March 31, 2015 compared to March 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in total debt, partially offset by the decrease in total McKesson stockholders’ equity. Our ratio of net debt to net capital employed increased at March 31, 2014 compared to March 31, 2013 primarily due to the increase in debt associated with our Celesio acquisition.In July 2013, the quarterly dividend was raised from $0.20 to $0.24 per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board. Dividends were $0.96 per share in 2015, $0.92 per share in 2014 and $0.80 per share in 2013. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we paid total cash dividends of $227 million, $214 million and $194 million. Additionally, as required under the Domination Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per Celesio share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio.47Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)Contractual Obligations:The table and information below presents our significant financial obligations and commitments at March 31, 2015: Years(In millions)Total Within 1 Over 1 to 3 Over 3 to 5 After 5On balance sheet Long-term debt (1)$9,709 $1,529 $2,705 $1,493 $3,982Other (2)535 60 180 117 178 Off balance sheet Interest on borrowings (3)3,179 335 568 375 1,901Purchase obligations (4)3,726 3,676 50 — —Operating lease obligations (5) 1,766 316 490 310 650Other (6)551 253 72 60 166Total$19,466 $6,169 $4,065 $2,355 $6,877(1)Represents maturities of the Company’s long-term obligations including an immaterial amount of capital lease obligations.

The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.At March 31, 2015, our banks and insurance companies have issued $142 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.At March 31, 2015, the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to Celesio was $1.4 billion, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.2 billion. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement on December 2, 2014, the noncontrolling shareholders of Celesio received a put right that enables them to put their Celesio shares to McKesson at €22.99 per share, which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published by the German Bundesbank semiannually, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid (“Put Amount”). The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the Put Amount are uncertain. Refer to Financial Notes 2 and 3, “Business Combinations” and “Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Credit Resources:We fund our working capital requirements primarily with cash and cash equivalents as well as short-term borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facilities, revolving credit facilities and from commercial paper issuances. Funds necessary for future debt maturities and our other cash requirements are expected to be met by existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, existing credit sources and other capital market transactions. Detailed information regarding our debt and financing activities is included in Financial Note 15, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.48Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)RELATED PARTY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS Information regarding our related party balances and transactions is included in Financial Note 25, “Related Party Balances and Transactions,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNew accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted, as well as those that have been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.49Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL REVIEW (Concluded)Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest rate risk: Our long-term debt bears interest predominately at fixed rates, whereas our short-term borrowings are at variable interest rates. At March 31, 2015, we had $0.7 billion in outstanding debt with variable interest rates. Our cash and cash equivalents balances earn interest at variable rates. At March 31, 2015, we had $5.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The effect of a hypothetical 50 bp increase in the underlying interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents, net of short-term borrowings and variable rate debt, would have resulted in a favorable impact to earnings in 2015 and 2014 of approximately $19 million and $12 million.Foreign exchange risk: The majority of our operations are conducted in U. S. dollars; however, certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and purchasing activities are incurred in and exposed to other currencies. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs, and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. Foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency forward-exchange contracts. These contracts are used to offset the potential earnings effects from mostly intercompany foreign currency loans. These contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency rate risk. As of March 31, 2015 and 2014, the effect of a hypothetical adverse 10% change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted the fair value of our foreign exchange contracts by approximately $223 million and $134 million. However, our risk management programs are designed such that the potential loss in value of these risk management portfolios described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. Refer to Financial Note 19, “Hedging Activities,” for more information on our foreign currency forward-exchange contracts.The selected hypothetical change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.50Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATION",2023-12-30 21:12:40.167541
