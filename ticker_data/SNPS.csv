883241,SNPS,SYNOPSYS INC,2014,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements.Business SummarySynopsys is a global leader in providing software, intellectual property and services used to design integrated circuits and electronic systems. We supply the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design, create prototypes for and test integrated circuits, also known as chips. We also offer intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these product offerings, we provide technical services to support our solutions and help our customers develop chips and electronic systems. We are also a leading provider of software tools that developers use to improve the quality, security, and time-to-market of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, energy, and industrials.Our EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs.26Table of ContentsDespite global economic uncertainty, we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technology and strong customer relationships, but also because of our time-based revenue business model. Under this model, a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract, which averages approximately three years. Time-based revenue, which consists of time-based license, maintenance and service revenue, generally represents approximately 90% of our total revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. Due to our business model, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.As we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market, for instance in IP products, we may experience increased variability in our revenue, though we expect time-based revenue to continue to generally represent approximately 90% of our total revenue. Overall, our business outlook remains solid based on our leading technology, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy. We believe that these factors will help us continue to successfully execute our strategies.Acquisition of CoverityOn March 24, 2014, we acquired Coverity, Inc. (Coverity), the leading provider of software quality, testing and security tools. We believe this acquisition has enabled us to enter into a new, growing market dedicated to helping companies deliver better software faster, by finding software code defects as the code is being developed rather than at the end of the process. Coverity’s customer base includes Synopsys’ semiconductor and systems customers, albeit different users and budgets, and extends well beyond to software developers such as independent software vendors and companies engaged in e-commerce. We believe the Coverity acquisition has expanded our total addressable market. However, due to the fair value adjustment of acquired deferred revenue and amortization of intangible assets, the acquisition had a negative effect on net income for fiscal 2014 and will continue to have a negative effect in the short term. We report revenue from our Coverity software quality, testing and security tools in our IP and Software Solutions group.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year.Fiscal 2014 and 2013 were 52-week years ending on November 1, 2014 and November 2, 2013, respectively. Fiscal 2012 was a 53-week year ending on November 3, 2012. The extra week in fiscal 2012 resulted in approximately $26 million of additional revenue, related primarily to time-based licenses, and approximately $16 million of additional expenses.For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to October 31 as the end of our fiscal year.Fiscal 2014 Financial Performance SummaryIn fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013, we delivered:•Total revenue of $2.1 billion, which included the impact from our current year acquisitions, an increase of 5%, •Diluted earnings per share of $1.64, an increase of 4%, •$3.5 billion in non-cancellable backlog, an increase of 13%, and•Cash flow from operations of $551.0 million for the year, an increase of 11%.In addition, our current year results benefited from a lower provision for income taxes.We continued to derive more than 90% of our revenue from time-based revenue in fiscal 2014.27Table of ContentsNew Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The new guidance will be effective for fiscal 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, using one of two prescribed retrospective methods. No early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading “Results of Operations” below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition;•Valuation of stock compensation;•Valuation of intangible assets; and•Income taxes.Revenue RecognitionWe derive revenue primarily from our software license arrangements. Software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees. Hardware revenue consists of FPGA-based emulation and prototyping products. With respect to software licenses, we utilize three license types: •Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs). TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. We bundle and do not charge separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for the term of the license. •Term licenses. Term licenses are also for a finite term, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee. •Perpetual licenses. Perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. For the three software license types, we recognize revenue as follows: •TSLs. We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. •Term licenses. We recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee 28Table of Contentsand 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer payments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. •Perpetual licenses. We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term software licenses and professional services fees. We recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable, and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations.Hardware revenue consists of FPGA-based emulation and prototyping products. We recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations and is not material to our total revenue.We also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events, for example, royalty arrangements. We refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue.” Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. These arrangements are not material to our total revenue. We infrequently enter into multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software deliverables such as hardware. We have determined that the software and non-software deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting. We recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type (TSL, term license or perpetual license). Such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods. We also enter into arrangements to deliver software products, either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification, or customization of the software. We account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues and costs. We measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project. Revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and software-related deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer. We recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, since there is not sufficient VSOE to allocate the TSL fee between license and maintenance services. We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us 29Table of Contentsto recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows: •Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and by us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement. •Delivery Has Occurred. We deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer’s hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically Freight on Board (FOB) shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter. •The Fee Is Fixed or Determinable. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75% or more of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers’ installments become due and payable. •Collectability Is Probable. We judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received.Valuation of Stock CompensationStock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. We estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards. We determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards. We calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends. These input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment. If a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors that become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs. Any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter.30Table of ContentsValuation of Intangible AssetsWe evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, covenants not to compete, capitalized software development, and in-process research and development. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2014, 2013 or 2012.Income TaxesOur tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved.We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse, and for tax loss and credit carryovers. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately $316.2 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2014 will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.We apply a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. An uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied.The calculation of tax liabilities involves inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws, significant assumptions, judgments and estimates including forward-looking financial projections and geographical mix of earnings. We are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, we would record an additional charge to earnings.31Table of ContentsResults of OperationsRevenue BackgroundWe generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses, maintenance and professional services and to a small extent, hardware products. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses, services and hardware products at varying times. In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered. The weighted average license term of the TSLs and term licenses we entered into in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 was 2.9 years, 3.6 years and 2.7 years, respectively. Revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development. Revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped. Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs.Revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year).Revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized after services are performed and accepted by the customer. Our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our time-based license, upfront license, maintenance and professional services for the period. We derive time-based license revenue largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements. We derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period. We derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software, and not when they are booked. Our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters. Conversely, a $120,000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered, but no future revenue. Additionally, revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fees and 100% of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable. Our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive EDA market. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total RevenueYear Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013(dollars in millions)$2,057.5 $1,962.2 $1,756.0 $95.3 5% $206.2 12%The overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of renewals of maintenance contracts, timing of IP consulting projects and royalties, and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due, as well as volatility in hardware sales.The sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2014 was due to our organic growth and revenues from acquired companies. The increases were primarily in time-based license revenue. Fiscal 2012 had approximately $26 million of additional revenue due to the additional week in that fiscal year.32Table of ContentsTime-Based License Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions) $1,699.1 $1,599.5 $1,449.3 $99.6 6% $150.2 10%Percentage of total revenue83% 82% 83% The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to increases in TSL license revenue due to our overall growth, including contributions of revenue from acquired companies.The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to increases in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, including those from acquisitions in fiscal 2012 and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and to a lesser extent, due to other time-based arrangements. The increase was partially offset by the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2012.Upfront License Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions) $135.8 $132.0 $105.1 $3.8 3% $26.9 26%Percentage of total revenue7% 7% 6% Changes in upfront license revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.Upfront license revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was relatively flat with a slight increase in the sale of perpetual licenses to IP and Software Solutions products.The increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products and perpetual licenses to IP and Software Solutions products, including those derived from our acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.As our sales of hardware and perpetual licenses to IP and Software Solutions products grow, we expect upfront license revenue to increase as a percentage of total revenue, but remain consistent with our business model in which approximately 90% of our total revenue consists of time-based revenue.Maintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions)Maintenance revenue$74.3 $79.2 $74.6 $(4.9) (6)% $4.6 6%Professional service and other revenue148.3 151.5 127.0 $(3.2) (2)% $24.5 19%Total$222.6 $230.7 $201.6 $(8.1) (4)% $29.1 14%Percentage of total revenue11% 12% 11% Changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing and type of contracts that bundle maintenance. The fluctuations in maintenance revenue in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 and in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 were primarily due to timing. The slight decrease in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the timing of IP customization projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method.33Table of ContentsThe increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in IP consulting services.Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions)Cost of revenue$456.9 $453.6 $392.7 $3.3 1% $60.9 16%Operating expenses1,351.9 1,262.2 1,173.3 $89.7 7% $88.9 8%Total$1,808.8 $1,715.8 $1,566.0 $93.0 5% $149.8 10%Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue88% 87% 89% Our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnel-related costs including salaries, benefits, stock compensation and variable compensation; changes in amortization; and changes in selling and marketing expenses. The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities; amortization of intangible assets; and depreciation. The increases in our expenses for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 were partially offset by the extra week of expenses in fiscal 2012 of $16 million. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013, or fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs.Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions)Cost of license revenue$268.4 $268.9 $232.8 $(0.5) — % $36.1 16%Cost of maintenance and service revenue87.2 80.4 78.6 $6.8 8 % $1.8 2%Amortization of intangible assets101.3 104.3 81.3 $(3.0) (3)% $23.0 28%Total$456.9 $453.6 $392.7 $3.3 1 % $60.9 16%Percentage of total revenue22% 23% 22% We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of license revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported.Cost of license revenue. Cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization, and costs 34Table of Contentsassociated with the delivery of our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates.Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of certain contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, and covenants not to compete related to acquisitions.Cost of revenue remained relatively flat in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 as increases in personnel-related costs of $20.4 million, driven by higher headcount and increases in consulting services, were partially offset by lower product costs of $15.3 million, primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments that were recorded in fiscal 2013, and a decrease of $3.0 million in amortization of intangible assets due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized.Cost of revenue increased by $60.9 million or 16% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to increases of $23.0 million in amortization of intangible assets and $17.7 million in personnel-related costs, primarily as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2012, particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and $25.9 million in product costs primarily due to product sales. The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2012 and a $1.3 million reduction in acquisition-related costs compared to fiscal 2012.Changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material.Operating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions) $718.8 $669.2 $581.6 $49.6 7% $87.6 15%Percentage of total revenue35% 34% 33% The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of $36.5 million in personnel-related costs primarily as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, functionally allocated expenses that were higher by $12.2 million, and a $3.2 million increase in consultant and contractor costs.The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to increases of $76.1 million in personnel-related costs and $11.0 million in functionally allocated expenses, as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions in fiscal 2012, particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and $8.6 million in consulting costs. The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $7.5 million in fiscal 2012 and a $6.3 million reduction in acquisition-related costs compared to fiscal 2012.Changes in other research and development expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material.Sales and Marketing Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions) $453.1 $426.0 $415.6 $27.1 6% $10.4 3%Percentage of total revenue22% 22% 24% Changes in commissions and other variable compensation are generally attributable to the volume of contracts and timing of shipments based on contract requirements.The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of $21.2 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from 35Table of Contentsacquisitions, an increase of $4.0 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments and higher functionally allocated expenses of $2.0 million.The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was due to increases in personnel-related costs of $15.9 million primarily driven by headcount increases, $2.0 million in marketing activities, and $1.4 million in maintenance. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $4.9 million in fiscal 2012 and a $5.2 million reduction in acquisition-related costs compared to fiscal 2012.Changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material.General and Administrative Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions) $155.2 $143.8 $157.5 $11.4 8% $(13.7) (9)%Percentage of total revenue8% 7% 9% The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to increases of $10.4 million in facilities and depreciation expenses, $9.8 million in professional service costs, $2.4 million of acquisition-related costs, and $1.2 million in personnel-related costs. The increases were partially offset by higher allocations of $15.3 million in expenses to other functions compared to the same period in fiscal 2013, due to increased spending in allocated costs, resulting from increased headcount.The decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was due to a decrease in acquisition-related costs of $25.4 million compared to fiscal 2012 and higher allocation of $7.7 million in expenses to other functions (cost of revenue, research and development, and sales and marketing) in fiscal 2013 as headcount growth in those functions, primarily driven by acquisitions, resulted in an increase in the pool of expenses to be allocated. The decrease in general and administrative expense was partially offset by increases of $15.2 million in professional service costs, $5.4 million in facilities and depreciation expenses, primarily due to our acquisitions, and $2.2 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions.Changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material.Change in Fair Value of Deferred CompensationThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset.Acquired In-Process Research and DevelopmentIn-process research and development (IPR&D) costs relate to in-process technologies acquired in acquisitions. The value assigned to IPR&D is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology, the successful development of the IPR&D, its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which are unknown at the time of determination.Upon completion of development, the underlying intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue. IPR&D projects acquired are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.36Table of ContentsAmortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete, and in-process research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years. Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions)Included in cost of revenue$101.3 $104.3 $81.3 $(3.0) (3)% $23.0 28%Included in operating expenses24.8 23.2 18.6 $1.6 7 % $4.6 25%Total$126.1 $127.5 $99.9 $(1.4) (1)% $27.6 28%Percentage of total revenue6% 6% 6% Amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.Amortization of intangible assets was relatively flat for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 as the full amortization of certain intangible assets was offset by additions of intangible assets in fiscal 2014.The increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts, which is incorporated by reference here.Impairment of Intangible Assets. We did not record any impairment charges to our intangible assets during fiscal 2014, 2013, or 2012.Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions)Interest income$1.3 $1.9 $1.6 $(0.6) (32)% $0.3 19 %Interest expense(1.9) (1.7) (2.0) (0.2) 12 % 0.3 (15)%Gain (loss) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan10.8 18.5 7.5 (7.7) (42)% 11.0 147 %Foreign currency exchange gain (loss)1.2 6.0 1.7 (4.8) (80)% 4.3 253 %Other, net12.0 4.5 2.3 7.5 167 % 2.2 96 %Total$23.4 $29.2 $11.1 $(5.8) (20)% $18.1 163 %The net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and decreased foreign currency exchange gains as a result of less movement in foreign currency exchange rates. The decreases were partially offset by a gain from the sale of a non-marketable equity investment in fiscal 2014 that was recorded in other, net.The net increase in other income (expense) in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in market value of the assets related to our deferred compensation plan, and an increase in gains in our foreign currency contracts, partially offset by lower interest expense due to a decrease in principal payment on a term loan.37Table of ContentsIncome TaxesOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 included tax benefits from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of $15.5 million (for fiscal years 2012 through 2013), from federal statute of limitations lapses of $6.7 million, and a settlement with the Taiwan tax authorities of $3.9 million (net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and application of settlements to other open fiscal years). Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 included tax benefits from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research tax credit of approximately $19.0 million, reversal of deferred taxes resulting from the merger of a foreign affiliate of $6.8 million, and settlement with the IRS of certain issues related to fiscal 2012 of $1.1 million. The reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2012 as well as a full year credit for fiscal 2013, compared to only two months of credit in fiscal 2014 as a result of the expiration of the credit on December 31, 2013. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 included tax benefits from settlements with the IRS of $15.9 million (for fiscal years 2010 through 2011), with Taiwan tax authorities of $14.7 million (net tax benefit resulting from fiscal 2008 settlement being applied to other open fiscal years), and with Hungarian tax authorities of $6.3 million (for fiscal years 2006 through 2010). For further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility. As of October 31, 2014, we held an aggregate of $162.0 million in cash and cash equivalents in the United States and an aggregate of $823.8 million in our foreign subsidiaries. Funds held in our foreign subsidiaries are generated from revenue outside North America. At present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund cash needs in the United States and if U.S. taxes have not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds.The following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet, cash flows, and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2014.Cash and cash equivalents Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2014 2013 (dollars in millions)Cash and cash equivalents$985.8 $1,022.4 $(36.6) (4)%Our cash decreased due to acquisitions, stock repurchases, and property and equipment spending during fiscal 2014, partially offset by the cash generated from our operations.Cash flows Year Ended October 31, $ Change $ Change 2014 2013 2012 2013 to 2014 2012 to 2013 (dollars in millions)Cash provided by operating activities$551.0 $496.7 $486.1 $54.3 $10.6Cash (used in) investing activities(497.3) (66.1) (879.1) (431.2) 813.0Cash provided by (used in) financing activities(73.7) (98.0) 243.5 24.3 (341.5)Cash provided by operating activitiesWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from time-based license revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.38Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections, which were partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors.Fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013. Cash provided by operating activities increased slightly due to an increase in collections from customers and a decrease in tax payments, offset partly by higher disbursements to vendors and higher personnel-related costs due to increased headcount.Cash used in investing activitiesFiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets, net of cash acquired, of $394.6 millionFiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition activities in fiscal 2013.Cash provided by (used in) financing activitiesFiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of a non-controlling interest in SpringSoft, Inc. for $44.0 million in fiscal 2013 and a decrease of $25.3 million in purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by a decrease of $49.8 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock. We repaid our senior unsecured revolving credit facility balance of $200.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, which had been drawn down during the second quarter of fiscal 2014.Fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increased common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, proceeds from credit facilities in fiscal 2012 that did not recur in the current period and less proceeds from issuances of common stock.Accounts Receivable, netYear Ended October 31, 2014 2013 $ Change % Change(dollars in millions) $326.7 $256.0 $70.7 28%Our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding (DSO) are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities. Our DSO was 55 days at October 31, 2014 and 46 days at October 31, 2013. The increase in DSO is attributable to the timing of billings at the end of fiscal 2014.Working Capital. Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets: Year Ended October 31, 2014 2013 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets$1,504.7 $1,448.0 $56.7 4 %Current liabilities1,386.8 1,222.9 $163.9 13 %Working capital$117.9 $225.1 $(107.2) (48)%Working capital at the end of fiscal 2014 was lower than at the end of fiscal 2013 primarily due to (1) a $100.7 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing of billings, (2) a $36.7 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, (3) a $38.9 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to timing of purchases, and (4) a $24.2 million increase in accrued income taxes. These changes in working capital were partially offset by a $70.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of our billings at the end of fiscal 2014, a $19.4 million increase in deferred taxes and an $8.2 million increase in income taxes receivable and prepaid taxes.39Table of ContentsOtherAs of October 31, 2014, our cash equivalents consisted of cash deposits, tax-exempt money market mutual funds, and taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk.We proactively manage our cash and cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Our cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 under fair value guidance. See Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our Revolver (defined below) will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.Other CommitmentsOn February 17, 2012, we entered into an agreement with several lenders (the Credit Agreement) providing for (i) a $350.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan). Principal payments on a portion of the Term Loan are due in equal quarterly installments of $7.5 million, with the remainder due when the Credit Agreement expires in October 2016. We can elect to make prepayments on the Term Loan, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. Subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the Credit Agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million through October 13, 2015. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants.During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we drew down $200.0 million under the Revolver to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Coverity on March 24, 2014 and during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we repaid the $200.0 million balance under the Revolver. As of October 31, 2014, we had a $75.0 million outstanding balance under the Term Loan, of which $45.0 million is classified as long-term and no outstanding balance under the Revolver. As of October 31, 2013 we had a $105.0 million outstanding balance under the Term Loan, of which $75.0 million is classified as long-term, and no outstanding balance under the Revolver. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. At October 31, 2014, borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR +0.975%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.150% and 0.300% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.As a result of the Coverity acquisition, we assumed Coverity’s credit facility with a U.S. bank that had an original expiration date of December 31, 2014. The facility provided a maximum borrowing limit of $7.0 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we chose to terminate the Coverity credit facility prior to the original expiration date.In December 2014, we drew down $250.0 million under the Revolver, primarily to finance the 2015 ASR. See Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Stock Repurchase Program for further detail on the 2015 ASR.40Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 31, 2014: Total Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2016/ Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018/ Fiscal 2019 Thereafter Other (in thousands) Lease Obligations: Capital Lease$22 $22 $— $— $— $—Operating Leases(1)$372,914 $40,549 $76,705 $59,408 $196,252 $—Purchase Obligations(2)155,376 151,968 3,158 250 — —Term Loan(3)75,000 30,000 45,000 — — —Other Long-Term Obligations(4)1,583 1,033 550 — — —Long term accrued income taxes(5)50,952 — — — — $50,952Total$655,847 $223,572 $125,413 $59,658 $196,252 $50,952(1)See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2014. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.(3)This commitment relates to the principal on the Term Loan as discussed in Other Commitments above.(4)These other obligations include a loan assumed through an acquisition and the fees associated with our Term Loan and Revolver.(5)Long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2014. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments in individual years beyond fiscal 2014 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 31, 2014, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2014, all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense.41Table of ContentsThe following tables present our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates:As of October 31, 2014 Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2015 2016 2017 Total Fair Value (in thousands)Cash equivalent (variable rate)$792,970 $— $— $792,970 $792,970Average interest rate0.21% —% —% Short-term debt (variable rate) Term Loan$30,000 $— $— $30,000 $30,000Average interest rateLIBOR +1.125% —% —% Long-term debt (variable rate) Term Loan$— $45,000 $— $45,000 $45,000Average interest rate—% LIBOR +1.125% As of October 31, 2013 Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2014 2015 2016 Total Fair Value (in thousands)Cash equivalent (variable rate)$839,149 $— $— $839,149 $839,149Average interest rate0.16% —% —% Short-term debt (variable rate) Term Loan$30,000 $— $— $30,000 $30,000Average interest rateLIBOR +1.125% —% —% Long-term debt (variable rate) Term Loan$— $30,000 $45,000 $75,000 $75,000Average interest rate—% LIBOR +1.125% LIBOR +1.125% Foreign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 20 months. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2014, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $11.8 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $11.8 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $11.8 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.42Table of ContentsNet unrealized losses of approximately $11.1 million and $1.8 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements.

We have approximately $10.9 million and $11.5 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of October 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. Investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. During fiscal 2014 and 2013, we did not write down the value of our investment portfolio. None of our investments are held for speculation purposes.44Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:30:22.198172

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements.Business SummarySynopsys, Inc. provides software, intellectual property, and services used by designers along the entire silicon to software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the quality and security of their applications. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits, also known as chips. We also offer intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, which are sold primarily to semiconductor and electronics companies, we provide technical services to support our solutions and help our customers develop chips and electronic systems. We are also a leading provider of software tools that developers use to improve the quality and security of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, energy, and industrials.Our EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. In addition, a number of consolidations 26Table of Contentshave taken place in the semiconductor industry recently. While we do not believe customer consolidations have had a material impact on our results, the future impact is uncertain. Please see the risk factor titled “Consolidation among our customers, as well as within the industries in which we operate, may negatively impact our operating results.” in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for a discussion of potential risks.Despite global economic uncertainty, we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technology and strong customer relationships, but also because of our time-based revenue business model. Under this model, a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract, which averages approximately three years. Time-based revenue, which consists of time-based license, maintenance and service revenue, generally represents approximately 90% of our total revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. Due to our business model, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.Our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, and driving growth in the software quality and security market, which we entered with our acquisition of Coverity, Inc. We have continued to make investments in the software quality and security space with additional recent acquisitions, which we believe have expanded our total addressable market. As we continue to expand our product portfolio, for instance in IP products, and our total addressable market, we may experience increased variability in our revenue, though we generally expect time-based revenue to continue to represent approximately 90% of our total revenue. Overall, our business outlook remains solid based on our leading technology, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy. We believe that these factors will help us continue to successfully execute our strategies.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. Fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 52-week years ending on October 31, 2015, November 1, 2014, and November 2, 2013, respectively. For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Fiscal 2015 Financial Performance SummaryIn fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014, our financial performance reflects the following:•Total revenue of $2.2 billion, an increase of $184.7 million or 9%, reflecting organic growth and several acquisitions,•Total cost of revenue and operating expenses of $2.0 billion, an increase of $167.0 million or 9%, primarily due to our operational growth and acquisitions resulting in higher employee-related costs,•Higher operating income of $266.5 million, an increase of $17.7 million or 7%, and•Higher provision for income taxes of $55.7 million, an increase of $42.7 million or 328%, primarily due to the integration of acquired technologies during fiscal 2015 and higher tax settlements in fiscal 2014, resulting in lower net income.We continued to derive more than 90% of our revenue from time-based revenue in fiscal 2015.New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.27Table of ContentsThe accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition;•Valuation of business combinations;•Valuation of intangible assets; and•Income taxes.Revenue RecognitionWe generate our revenue from the sale of our software licenses, maintenance and professional services, and to a small extent, hardware products. Software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and professional service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees. Hardware revenue consists of sales of FPGA-based emulation and prototyping products. With respect to software licenses, we utilize three license types: •Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs). TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. We bundle and do not charge separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for the term of the license. •Term licenses. Term licenses are also for a finite term, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee. •Perpetual licenses. Perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. For the three software license types, we recognize revenue as follows: •TSLs. We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. •Term licenses. We recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer payments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. •Perpetual licenses. We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term software licenses and professional services fees. We recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable, and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer. 28Table of ContentsRevenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations.Hardware revenue consists of sales of FPGA-based emulation and prototyping products. We recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations and is not material to our total revenue.We also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events, for example, royalty arrangements. We refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue.” Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. These arrangements are not material to our total revenue. We infrequently enter into multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software deliverables such as hardware. We have determined that the software and non-software deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting. We recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type (TSL, term license or perpetual license). Such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods. We also enter into arrangements to deliver software products, either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification, or customization of the software. We account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues and costs. We measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project. Revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and software-related deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer. We recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, since there is not sufficient VSOE to allocate the TSL fee between license and maintenance services. We make judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows: •Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and by us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement. •Delivery Has Occurred. We deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer’s hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically Freight on Board (FOB) shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter. 29Table of Contents•The Fee Is Fixed or Determinable. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75% or more of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers’ installments become due and payable. •Collectability Is Probable. We judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received.Valuation of Business Combinations:We are required to allocate the purchase price to tangible assets, liabilities and contingencies assumed, and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets which are amortized over various estimated useful lives. Our estimates may include, but are not limited to, future cash flows of an acquired business, the appropriate discounted rate, and the cost savings expected to be derived from an acquisition. These estimates are inherently difficult, subjective and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price allocation to the acquired assets and liabilities could be different. In addition, we make judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are also inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. Therefore, our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets and liabilities can have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.Valuation of Intangible AssetsWe evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, covenants not to compete, capitalized software development, and in-process research and development. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.Income TaxesOur estimates and assumptions made in our tax provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved.We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse, and for tax loss and credit carryovers. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount 30Table of Contentsthat is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately $272.0 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2015 will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.We apply a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. An uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied.The calculation of tax liabilities involves inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws, significant assumptions, judgments and estimates including forward-looking financial projections and geographical mix of earnings. We are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, we would record an additional charge to earnings.Results of OperationsRevenue BackgroundWe generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses, maintenance and professional services, and to a small extent, hardware products. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses, services and hardware products at varying times. •In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered. The weighted average license term of the TSLs and term licenses we entered into in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 was 2.7 years, 2.9 years and 3.6 years, respectively. •Revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development. •Revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped. •Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs.•Revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year).•Revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized after services are performed and accepted by the customer. Our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our time-based license, upfront license, maintenance and professional services for the period. We derive time-based license revenue largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements. We derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period. We derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software, and not when they are booked. 31Table of ContentsOur license revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the 12 succeeding quarters. Conversely, a $120,000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered, but no future revenue. Additionally, revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fees and 100% of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable. Our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive EDA market. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total RevenueYear Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014(dollars in millions)$2,242.2 $2,057.5 $1,962.2 $184.7 9% $95.3 5%The overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of IP consulting projects and royalties and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due, as well as volatility in hardware sales.The sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2015 was due to our overall organic growth and revenues from acquired companies. The increases were primarily in time-based license revenue and hardware sales.Time-Based License Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions) $1,792.2 $1,699.1 $1,599.5 $93.1 5% $99.6 6%Percentage of total revenue80% 83% 82% The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, and for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to our overall growth, including contributions of revenue from acquired companies.Upfront License Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions) $197.3 $135.8 $132.0 $61.5 45% $3.8 3%Percentage of total revenue9% 7% 7% Changes in upfront license revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.The increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of hardware products.32Table of ContentsUpfront license revenue for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was relatively flat with a slight increase in the sale of perpetual licenses to IP, Systems and Software Integrity products. As our sales of hardware products grow, upfront license revenue may increase as a percentage of total revenue, but we expect it to remain consistent with our business model in which approximately 90% of our total revenue consists of time-based revenue.Maintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions)Maintenance revenue$70.1 $74.3 $79.2 $(4.2) (6)% $(4.9) (6)%Professional service and other revenue182.6 148.3 151.5 $34.3 23 % $(3.2) (2)%Total$252.7 $222.6 $230.7 $30.1 14 % $(8.1) (4)%Percentage of total revenue11% 11% 12% Changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing of contract renewals and the type of contracts that bundle maintenance.

The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our organic growth and acquisitions, and related fixed charges including facilities; amortization of intangible assets; and depreciation. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, or fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs.33Table of ContentsCost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions)Cost of license revenue$303.6 $268.4 $268.9 $35.2 13% $(0.5) — %Cost of maintenance and service revenue105.3 87.2 80.4 $18.1 21% $6.8 8 %Amortization of intangible assets110.0 101.3 104.3 $8.7 9% $(3.0) (3)%Total$518.9 $456.9 $453.6 $62.0 14% $3.3 1 %Percentage of total revenue23% 22% 23% We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of license revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported.Cost of license revenue. Cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates.Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.The increase of cost of revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increases of $19.8 million in product costs due to increased sales, $16.8 million in costs related to our professional services revenue, $11.4 million in personnel-related costs driven by higher headcount, including those from acquisitions, $8.7 million in amortization of intangible assets, and higher functionally allocated expenses of $2.6 million. Cost of revenue remained relatively flat in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 as increases in personnel-related costs of $20.4 million, driven by higher headcount and increases in consulting services, were partially offset by lower product costs of $15.3 million, primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments that were recorded in fiscal 2013, and a decrease of $3.0 million in amortization of intangible assets due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized.Changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material.Operating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions) $776.2 $718.8 $669.2 $57.4 8% $49.6 7%Percentage of total revenue35% 35% 34% The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $39.6 million in personnel-related costs driven by headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by $12.0 million. 34Table of ContentsThe increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of $36.5 million in personnel-related costs driven by headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, functionally allocated expenses that were higher by $12.2 million, and a $3.2 million increase in consultant and contractor costs.Changes in other research and development expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material.Sales and Marketing Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions) $474.4 $453.1 $426.0 $21.3 5% $27.1 6%Percentage of total revenue21% 22% 22% Changes in commissions and other variable compensation are generally attributable to the volume of contracts and timing of shipments based on contract requirements.The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $13.5 million in personnel-related costs driven by headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, $2.4 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments and higher functionally allocated expenses of $2.7 million.The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of $21.2 million in personnel-related costs driven by headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, an increase of $4.0 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments and higher functionally allocated expenses of $2.0 million.Changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material.General and Administrative Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions) $165.1 $155.2 $143.8 $9.9 6% $11.4 8%Percentage of total revenue7% 8% 7% The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increases of $20.0 million in facilities and depreciation expenses including those from acquisitions, $3.9 million in personnel-related costs primarily due to higher headcount, and $5.2 million in acquisition-related professional services costs. The increases were partially offset by higher allocations of $20.5 million in expenses to other functions compared to the same period in fiscal 2014, due to increased spending in allocated costs, resulting from increased headcount.The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to increases of $10.4 million in facilities and depreciation expenses, $9.8 million in professional service costs, $2.4 million of acquisition-related costs, and $1.2 million in personnel-related costs. The increases were partially offset by higher allocations of $15.3 million in expenses to other functions compared to the same period in fiscal 2013, due to increased spending in allocated costs, resulting from increased headcount.Changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the above mentioned periods were not individually material.35Table of ContentsChange in Fair Value of Deferred CompensationThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset.Acquired In-Process Research and DevelopmentIn-process research and development (IPR&D) costs relate to in-process technologies acquired in acquisitions. The value assigned to IPR&D is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology, the successful development of the IPR&D, its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which are unknown at the time of determination.Upon completion of development, the underlying intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue. IPR&D projects acquired are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete, and in-process research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years. Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions)Included in cost of revenue$110.0 $101.3 $104.3 $8.7 9% $(3.0) (3)%Included in operating expenses26.0 24.8 23.2 $1.2 5% $1.6 7 %Total$136.0 $126.1 $127.5 $9.9 8% $(1.4) (1)%Percentage of total revenue6% 6% 6% Amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.The increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the additions of acquired intangible assets, including from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions, which were partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized.Amortization of intangible assets was relatively flat for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 as the full amortization of certain intangible assets was offset by additions of intangible assets in fiscal 2014.36Table of ContentsRestructuring ChargesIn November 2014, we initiated a restructuring program that included a voluntary retirement program (VRP) and a minimal headcount reduction program. The VRP was offered to certain eligible employees in the United States and enrollment for those employees was completed on November 21, 2014. As of October 31, 2015, the program has been completed, and no further charges are anticipated.The following is a summary of our restructuring activities: Balance at Beginning of Period Costs Incurred (Reduced) Cash Payments Balance at End of Period (in millions)Fiscal 2015$— $15.1 $(15.1) $—See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions)Interest income$2.8 $1.3 $1.9 $1.5 115 % $(0.6) (32)%Interest expense(2.8) (1.9) (1.7) (0.9) 47 % (0.2) 12 %Gain (loss) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan3.7 10.8 18.5 (7.1) (66)% (7.7) (42)%Foreign currency exchange gain (loss)6.3 1.2 6.0 5.1 425 % (4.8) (80)%Other, net5.1 12.0 4.5 (6.9) (58)% 7.5 167 %Total$15.1 $23.4 $29.2 $(8.3) (35)% $(5.8) (20)%The net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a non-marketable equity investment in fiscal 2014, and lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets, which were partially offset by increased foreign currency exchange gains in the current year as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar against the related foreign currencies.The net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and decreased foreign currency exchange gains as a result of less movement in foreign currency exchange rates. The decreases were partially offset by a gain from the sale of a non-marketable equity investment in fiscal 2014 that was recorded in other, net.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of $33.0 million partially offset by tax benefits from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research tax credit of approximately $12.4 million, a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of $4.0 million for fiscal 2014, and a settlement with the Taiwan tax authorities of $2.3 million (net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2012 and 2013). The reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2014 as well as two months of fiscal 2015, which was recorded in fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 included tax benefits from a settlement with the IRS of $15.5 million (for fiscal years 2012 through 2013), from federal statute of limitations lapses of $6.7 million, and a settlement with the Taiwan tax authorities of $3.9 million (net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and application of settlements to other open fiscal years). Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 included tax benefits from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research tax credit of approximately $19.0 million, reversal of deferred taxes resulting from the merger of a foreign affiliate of $6.8 million, and settlement with the IRS of certain issues related to fiscal 2012 of $1.1 million. The reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2012 as well as a full year credit for fiscal 2013, compared to only two months of credit in fiscal 2014 as a result of the expiration of the credit on December 31, 2013. For further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.37Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. As of October 31, 2015, we held an aggregate of $155.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and an aggregate of $809.4 million in our foreign subsidiaries. Funds held in our foreign subsidiaries are mostly generated from revenue outside North America. At present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. However, in the event funds from foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund cash needs in the U.S. and if U.S. taxes have not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds.The following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet, cash flows, and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2015.Cash and Cash Equivalents Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in millions)Cash and cash equivalents$836.2 $985.8 $(149.6) (15)%Our cash decreased primarily due to cash used for stock repurchases under our accelerated stock repurchase agreements entered into in December 2014 (the December 2014 ASR) and August 2015 (the August 2015 ASR), debt repayments, and cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets. The decrease was partially offset by funds generated from our operations and proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.Cash Flows Year Ended October 31, $ Change $ Change 2015 2014 2013 2014 to 2015 2013 to 2014 (dollars in millions)Cash provided by operating activities$495.2 $551.0 $496.7 $(55.8) $54.3Cash used in investing activities(559.6) (497.3) (66.1) (62.3) (431.2)Cash used in financing activities(62.1) (73.7) (98.0) 11.6 24.3Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based license revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors, which were partially offset by higher cash collections.Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections, which were partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesFiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by purchases of short-term investments, net of proceeds from the sales of our short-term investments, of $129.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets, net of cash acquired, of $54.5 million.Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets, net of cash acquired, of $394.6 million38Table of ContentsCash Used in Financing ActivitiesFiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase of proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $260.0 million which was partially offset by an increase of $160.3 million for our stock repurchase activities and an increase of $99.5 million for repayment of debt. Fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of a non-controlling interest in SpringSoft, Inc. for $44.0 million in fiscal 2013 and a decrease of $25.3 million in purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by a decrease of $49.8 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock. We repaid our senior unsecured revolving credit facility balance of $200.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014, which had been drawn down during the second quarter of fiscal 2014.Accounts Receivable, netYear Ended October 31, 2015 2014 $ Change % Change(dollars in millions) $385.7 $326.7 $59.0 18%Our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding (DSO) are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities. Our DSO was 60 days at October 31, 2015 and 55 days at October 31, 2014. The increase in DSO is attributable to the growth in our business and timing of billings at the end of fiscal 2015.Working Capital Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets: Year Ended October 31, 2015 2014 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets$1,563.8 $1,504.7 $59.1 4 %Current liabilities1,578.4 1,386.8 $191.6 14 %Working capital$(14.6) $117.9 $(132.5) (112)%Working capital at the end of fiscal 2015 was lower than at the end of fiscal 2014 primarily due to (1) a $174.7 million increase in short-term debt, (2) a $149.6 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and (3) a $40.0 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing. These changes in working capital were partially offset by (1) a $128.7 million increase in short-term investments, (2) a $59.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of our billings at the end of fiscal 2015, and (3) a $20.2 million increase in income taxes receivable and prepaid taxes.OtherOur available-for-sale securities as of October 31, 2015 consisted of investment-grade U.S. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and others. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer. As of October 31, 2015, we had no direct holdings in structured investment vehicles, sub-prime mortgage-backed securities or collateralized debt obligations and no exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds. During fiscal 2015, we had no impairment charge associated with our available-for-sale securities portfolio. While we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, we regularly review our investments and associated risk profiles, which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio. We proactively manage our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase activities to ensure ample liquidity. Additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our investment portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents and fixed income portfolio, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. The majority of our investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. See Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 39Table of ContentsWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our Revolver (defined below) will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.Other CommitmentsOn February 17, 2012, we entered into an agreement with several lenders (the Credit Agreement) providing for (i) a $350.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan). Principal payments on a portion of the Term Loan are due in equal quarterly installments of $7.5 million, with the remainder due in October 2016. We can elect to make prepayments on the Term Loan, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. On May 19, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated in order to increase the size of the Revolver from $350.0 million to $500.0 million and to extend the termination date of the Revolver from October 14, 2016 to May 19, 2020. The amended and restated Credit Agreement also replaced a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum specified level of cash with a covenant requiring a minimum interest coverage ratio. Subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the amended and restated Credit Agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million through May 2019. The amended and restated Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of October 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.As of October 31, 2015, we had a $45.0 million outstanding balance under the Term Loan and a $160.0 million outstanding balance under the Revolver, all of which is considered short term. As of October 31, 2014, we had a $75.0 million outstanding balance under the Term Loan, of which $45.0 million was classified as long-term, and no outstanding balance under the Revolver. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the amended and restated Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2015, borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR +1.000%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 31, 2015: Total Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2017/ Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2019/ Fiscal 2020 Thereafter Other (in thousands) Lease Obligations: Capital Lease$6 $6 $— $— $— $—Operating Leases(1)366,641 52,266 88,674 60,970 164,731 —Purchase Obligations(2)128,003 123,799 4,169 35 — —Revolver(3)160,000 160,000 — — — —Term Loan(3)45,000 45,000 — — — —Other Long-Term Obligations(4)3,115 675 1,350 1,090 — —Long term accrued income taxes(5)37,763 — — — — 37,763Total$740,528 $381,746 $94,193 $62,095 $164,731 $37,763(1)See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2015. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.(3)These commitments relate to the principal of the Revolver or the Term Loan as discussed in Other Commitments above.40Table of Contents(4)These other obligations include fees associated with our Term Loan and Revolver.(5)Long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2015. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments in individual years beyond fiscal 2015 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents short-term investments and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2015, all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of these investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. The following tables present our cash equivalents, short-term investments and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates:As of October 31, 2015 Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2016 2017 2018 Total Fair Value (in thousands)Cash & Cash equivalent (variable rate)$584,446 $— $— $584,446 $584,446Average interest rate0.23% —% —% Short-term investments (variable rate)$2,150 $3,352 $1,198 $6,700 $6,700Average interest rate0.59% 0.69% 0.73% Short-term investments (fixed rate)$98,014 $23,334 $699 $122,047 $122,047Average interest rate0.60% 1.04% 1.17% Short-term debt (variable rate) Term Loan$45,000 $— $— $45,000 $45,000Average interest rateLIBOR +1.125% —% —% Revolver$160,000 $— $— $160,000 $160,000Average interest rateLIBOR +1.000% —% —% 41Table of ContentsAs of October 31, 2015, the stated maturities of our short-term investments which are classified as available for sale securities are: Fair Value (in thousands)Due in 1 year or less$76,784Due in 2-5 years51,871Due in 5-10 years92Total$128,747Actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. Realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities have not been material in any period presented. The following table presents the amounts of our short-term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by fiscal year of effective maturity and average book yield:Foreign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2015, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $9.8 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $9.8 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $9.8 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.Net unrealized losses of approximately $14.8 million and $11.1 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties.

883241,SNPS,SYNOPSYS INC,2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements.Business SummarySynopsys, Inc. provides software, intellectual property, and services used by designers across the entire silicon to software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the quality and security of their applications. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test ICs, also known as chips. We also offer intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than design those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. We are also a leading provider of software tools that developers use to improve the quality and security of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, energy, industrials, and automotive.Our EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also 28Table of Contentshelping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, their research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. In addition, several consolidations have taken place in the semiconductor industry recently. While we do not believe customer consolidations have had a material impact on our results, the future impact is uncertain. For a discussion of potential risks, please see the risk factor titled “Consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results.” in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.Despite global economic uncertainty, we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, but also because of our time-based revenue business model. Under this model, a substantial majority of our customers pay over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract, which averages approximately three years. Time-based revenue, which consists of time-based products, maintenance and service revenue, represents approximately 90% of our total revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. Due to our business model, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.Our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, and driving growth in the software quality and security market. As we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market, for instance in the software quality and security space, and hardware grows, we may experience increased variability in our revenue, though we generally expect time-based revenue to continue to represent approximately 90% of our total revenue. Overall, our business outlook remains solid based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy. We believe that these factors will help us continue to execute our strategies successfully.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. Fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 52-week years ending on October 29, 2016, October 31, 2015, and November 1, 2014, respectively. For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Fiscal 2016 Financial Performance SummaryIn fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015, our financial performance reflects the following:•Revenues were $2.4 billion, an increase of $180.3 million or 8%, primarily driven by the overall growth in our business mainly due to higher TSL revenues and hardware sales. •Total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $2.1 billion, an increase of $129.4 million or 7%, primarily due to increases in headcount, including those from acquisitions. •Higher operating income of $317.4 million, an increase of $50.9 million or 19%.We derived approximately 90% of our revenue from time-based revenue in fiscal 2016. Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.1 billion as of October 31, 2016, of which 15% was in the U.S. New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.29Table of ContentsThe accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition;•Valuation of business combinations;•Valuation of intangible assets; and•Income taxes.Revenue RecognitionWe generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses, maintenance and professional services, and to a lesser extent, hardware products. Software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and professional service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees. Hardware revenue consists of sales of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based emulation and prototyping products. Most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and additional meaningful rights that provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. Throughout the contract, our customers are typically using a myriad of products to complete each phase of a chip design and are concurrently working on multiple chip designs, or projects, in different phases of the design. During this time, the customer looks to us to release state-of-the-art technology as we keep up with the pace of change, to address requested enhancements to our tools to meet customer specifications, to provide support at each stage of the customer’s design, including the final manufacturing of the chip (the tape-out stage), and other important services. With respect to software licenses, we utilize three license types: •Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs). TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. The majority of our arrangements are TSLs due to the nature of the business and customer requirements. In addition to the licenses, the arrangements also include: post-contract customer support, which includes providing frequent updates and upgrades to maintain the utility of the software due to rapid changes in technology; other intertwined services such as multiple copies of the tools; assisting our customers in applying our technology in their development environment; and rights to remix licenses for other licenses.•Term licenses. We also infrequently enter into certain license arrangements wherein licenses are provided for a finite term without any other services or rights, including rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee. •Perpetual licenses. Perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. For the three software license types, we recognize revenue as follows: •TSLs. We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. •Term licenses. We recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer payments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. 30Table of Contents•Perpetual licenses. We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term software licenses and professional services fees. We recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable, and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations.Hardware revenue consists of sales of FPGA-based emulation and prototyping products. We recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations and is not material to our total revenue.We also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events, for example, royalty arrangements. We refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue.” Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs. Such revenue is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. These arrangements are not material to our total revenue. We infrequently enter into multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software deliverables such as hardware. We have determined that the software and non-software deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting. We recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type (TSL, term license or perpetual license). Such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods. We also enter into arrangements to deliver software products, either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification, or customization of the software. We account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues and costs. We measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project. Revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as ""maintenance and service revenue"" in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and software-related deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer. With respect to TSL arrangements, due to the complexity of the tools, the complexity of the arrangement terms and intertwined services, the license, maintenance and other services are not separable and are considered as a combined unit. Additionally, we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value to allocate the fee between these services. Therefore, we recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We make judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the 31Table of Contentsfull license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows: •Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and by us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement. •Delivery Has Occurred. We deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer’s hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically Freight on Board (FOB) shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter. •The Fee Is Fixed or Determinable. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75% or more of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers’ installments become due and payable. •Collectability Is Probable. We judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received.Valuation of Business CombinationsWe are required to allocate the purchase price to tangible assets, liabilities and contingencies assumed, and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets which are amortized over various estimated useful lives. Our estimates may include, but are not limited to, future cash flows of an acquired business, the appropriate discounted rate, and the cost savings expected to be derived from an acquisition. These estimates are inherently difficult, subjective and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price allocation to the acquired assets and liabilities could be different. In addition, we make judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are also inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. Therefore, our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets and liabilities can have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.Valuation of Intangible AssetsWe evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, covenants not to compete, capitalized software development, and in-process research and development. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant 32Table of Contentsnegative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.Income TaxesOur estimates and assumptions made in our tax provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved.We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse, and for tax loss and credit carryovers. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately $281.0 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2016 will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.We apply a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. An uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied.The calculation of tax liabilities involves inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws, significant assumptions, judgments and estimates including forward-looking financial projections and geographical mix of earnings. We are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, we would record an additional charge to earnings.Results of OperationsRevenue BackgroundWe generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses, maintenance and professional services, and to a lesser extent, hardware products. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses, services and hardware products at varying times. •In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered. The weighted-average license term of the TSLs and term licenses is typically approximately three years, but varies from quarter to quarter due to the nature and timing of the arrangements entered into during the quarter. The weighted-average license term of the TSLs and term licenses we entered into in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 was 3.0 years, 2.7 years and 2.9 years, respectively. •Revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development. •Revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped and when title is transferred. •Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs.33Table of Contents•Revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year).•Revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized as the services are performed. Our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our time-based products, upfront products, and maintenance and services for the period. We derive time-based products revenue largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent from contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements. We derive upfront products revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period. We derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software, and not when they are booked. Our revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the 12 succeeding quarters. Conversely, a $120,000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered, but no future revenue. Additionally, revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fees and 100% of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable. Our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive EDA market. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total RevenueYear Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015(dollars in millions)$2,422.5 $2,242.2 $2,057.5 $180.3 8% $184.7 9%The overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of IP consulting projects, royalties, variability in hardware sales and due to certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due.The sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the overall growth in our business mainly due to higher TSL revenues and hardware sales.Time-Based Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions) $1,910.9 $1,792.2 $1,699.1 $118.7 7% $93.1 5%Percentage of total revenue79% 80% 83% The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to the overall growth in our business, including arrangements booked in prior periods and, to a lesser extent, contributions from acquisitions.34Table of ContentsThe increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to our overall growth, including contributions of revenue from acquired companies.Upfront Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions) $248.1 $197.3 $135.8 $50.8 26% $61.5 45%Percentage of total revenue10% 9% 7% Changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, and for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of hardware products driven by timing of customer requirements.As our sales of hardware products grow, upfront products revenue may increase, but we expect it to remain consistent with our business model, in which approximately 90% of our total revenue is attributable to time-based products, maintenance and professional services revenue on an annual basis.Maintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions)Maintenance revenue$74.4 $70.1 $74.3 $4.3 6% $(4.2) (6)%Professional service and other revenue189.1 182.6 148.3 $6.5 4% $34.3 23 %Total$263.5 $252.7 $222.6 $10.8 4% $30.1 14 %Percentage of total revenue11% 11% 11% The increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance.The decrease in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the timing of contract renewals and the type of contracts that bundle maintenance.The increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the timing of IP consulting projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method.The increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the increase in, and timing of, IP consulting projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method.Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions)Cost of revenue$543.0 $518.9 $456.9 $24.1 5% $62.0 14%Operating expenses1,562.2 1,456.8 1,351.9 $105.4 7% $104.9 8%Total$2,105.2 $1,975.7 $1,808.8 $129.5 7% $166.9 9%Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue87% 88% 88% 35Table of ContentsOur expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnel-related costs including salaries, benefits, stock compensation and variable compensation; changes in amortization; and changes in selling and marketing expenses. The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our overall growth, including those from acquisitions, and related fixed charges including facilities, as well as higher product costs due to increased hardware sales. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, or fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs.Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions)Cost of products revenue$346.9 $303.6 $268.4 $43.3 14 % $35.2 13%Cost of maintenance and service revenue94.0 105.3 87.2 $(11.3) (11)% $18.1 21%Amortization of intangible assets102.1 110.0 101.3 $(7.9) (7)% $8.7 9%Total$543.0 $518.9 $456.9 $24.1 5 % $62.0 14%Percentage of total revenue22% 23% 22% We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.Cost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates.Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increases of $24.2 million in product costs due to increased sales, $19.7 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, which were partially offset by decreases of $13.4 million in costs related to our professional services revenue and $7.9 million in amortization of intangible assets.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increases of $19.8 million in product costs due to increased sales, $16.8 million in costs related to our professional services revenue, $11.4 million in personnel-related costs driven by higher headcount, including those from acquisitions, $8.7 million in amortization of intangible assets, and higher functionally allocated expenses of $2.6 million. Changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.36Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions) $856.7 $776.2 $718.8 $80.5 10% $57.4 8%Percentage of total revenue35% 35% 35% The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increases of $64.3 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, $5.7 million in consultant and contractor costs, $5.1 million in research and development supplies, and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by $3.0 million.The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $39.6 million in personnel-related costs driven by headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by $12.0 million.

The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $13.5 million in personnel-related costs driven by headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, $2.4 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments and higher functionally allocated expenses of $2.7 million.Changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.General and Administrative Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions) $166.0 $165.1 $155.2 $0.9 1% $9.9 6%Percentage of total revenue7% 7% 8% General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 remained relatively flat as increases of $5.2 million in maintenance costs and $2.5 million in professional service costs were offset by $7.2 million of lower facilities expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increases of $20.0 million in facilities and depreciation expenses including those from acquisitions, $3.9 million in 37Table of Contentspersonnel-related costs primarily due to higher headcount, and $5.2 million in acquisition-related professional services costs. The increases were partially offset by higher allocations of $20.5 million in expenses to other functions compared to the same period in fiscal 2014, due to increased spending in allocated costs, resulting from increased headcount.Changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Change in Fair Value of Deferred CompensationThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete, and in-process research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years. Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions)Included in cost of revenue$102.1 $110.0 $101.3 $(7.9) (7)% $8.7 9%Included in operating expenses27.5 26.0 24.8 $1.5 6 % $1.2 5%Total$129.6 $136.0 $126.1 $(6.4) (5)% $9.9 8%Percentage of total revenue5% 6% 6% Amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of products revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.The decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized, partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets.The increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the additions of acquired intangible assets, including from our fiscal 2015 acquisitions, which were partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized.Restructuring ChargesDuring fiscal 2016, we recorded $9.6 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary employee terminations. As of October 31, 2016, there was a $5.7 million outstanding balance remaining in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The remaining balance will be paid in fiscal 2017.During fiscal 2015, we recorded $15.1 million of restructuring charges pursuant to the fiscal 2015 restructuring program, which included a voluntary retirement program (VRP) and a minimal headcount reduction program. The fiscal 2015 restructuring program was completed as of October 31, 2015.38Table of ContentsThe following is a summary of our restructuring activities: Balance at Beginning of Period Costs Incurred (Reduced) Cash Payments Balance at End of Period (in millions)Fiscal 2016$— $9.6 $(3.9) $5.7Fiscal 2015$— $15.1 $(15.1) $—See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions)Interest income$3.7 $2.8 $1.3 $0.9 32 % $1.5 115 %Interest expense(3.8) (2.8) (1.9) (1.0) 36 % (0.9) 47 %Gain (loss) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan4.4 3.7 10.8 0.7 19 % (7.1) (66)%Foreign currency exchange gain (loss)0.2 6.3 1.2 (6.1) (97)% 5.1 425 %Other, net7.7 5.1 12.0 2.6 51 % (6.9) (58)%Total$12.2 $15.1 $23.4 $(2.9) (19)% $(8.3) (35)%The net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower gains in foreign currency exchange as a result of the weakened U.S. dollar against the related foreign currencies, partially offset by increased income on foreign exchange hedging contracts that was recorded in Other, net. The net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a gain from the sale of a non-marketable equity investment in fiscal 2014, and lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets, which were partially offset by increased foreign currency exchange gains in the current year as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar against the related foreign currencies.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included tax benefits from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of $20.7 million for fiscal 2015 and the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. federal research tax credit of approximately $37.1 million, partially offset by tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of $37.5 million, the impact of undistributed foreign earnings of $9.6 million, and an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $14.0 million as a result of changes in the expected utilization of state credits. The reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2015 as well as twelve months of fiscal 2016, which was recorded in fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of $33.0 million partially offset by tax benefits from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research tax credit of approximately $12.4 million, a settlement with the IRS of $4.0 million for fiscal 2014, and a settlement with the Taiwan tax authorities of $2.3 million (net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2012 and 2013). The reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2014 as well as two months of fiscal 2015, which was recorded in fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 included tax benefits from a settlement with the IRS of $15.5 million (for fiscal years 2012 through 2013), from federal statute of limitations lapses of $6.7 million, and a settlement with the Taiwan tax authorities of $3.9 million (net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and application of settlements to other open fiscal years). The integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among company-controlled entities. The income tax effect is generally recognized over five years. These intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a company-controlled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition. For further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.39Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. As of October 31, 2016, we held an aggregate of $165.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and an aggregate of $951.5 million in our foreign subsidiaries. Certain amounts held outside the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. (subject to local law restrictions), but under current U.S. tax law, could be subject to U.S. income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. We have provided for the U.S. income tax liability on foreign earnings, except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. However, in the event funds from foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund cash needs in the U.S. and if U.S. taxes have not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds.The following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow, and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2016.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2016 2015 (dollars in millions)Cash and cash equivalents$976.6 $836.2 $140.4 17%Short-term investments$140.7 $128.7 $12.0 9%Total$1,117.3 $964.9 $152.4 16%Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased primarily due to cash generated from our operations and cash received from employee stock option exercises. Cash generated was partially offset by cash used for purchases of treasury stock under our stock repurchase program, purchases of property and equipment, cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.Cash Flows Year Ended October 31, $ Change $ Change 2016 2015 2014 2015 to 2016 2014 to 2015 (dollars in millions)Cash provided by operating activities$586.6 $495.2 $551.0 $91.4 $(55.8)Cash used in investing activities(142.7) (559.6) (497.3) 416.9 (62.3)Cash used in financing activities(306.9) (62.1) (73.7) (244.8) 11.6Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.Fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections, partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors.Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors, which were partially offset by higher cash collections.40Table of ContentsCash Used in Investing ActivitiesFiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by lower cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets of $280.1 million, lower purchases of short-term investments of $70.2 million, higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments of $47.2 million, and lower purchases of property and equipment of $20.1 million.Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by purchases of short-term investments, net of proceeds from the sales of our short-term investments, of $129.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets, net of cash acquired, of $54.5 million.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesFiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the drawdown of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $275.0 million and higher stock repurchase activities of $120.0 million, partially offset by lower debt repayments of $145.4 million.Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase of proceeds from our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $260.0 million which was partially offset by an increase of $160.3 million for our stock repurchase activities and an increase of $99.5 million for repayment of debt. Accounts Receivable, netYear Ended October 31, 2016 2015 $ Change % Change(dollars in millions) $438.9 $385.7 $53.2 14%Our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding (DSO) are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities. Our DSO was 63 days at October 31, 2016 and 60 days at October 31, 2015. The increase in DSO is primarily due to the timing of billings and contract renewals.Working Capital Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets: Year Ended October 31, 2016 2015 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets$1,716.9 $1,468.8 $248.1 17 %Current liabilities1,714.9 1,578.4 $136.5 9 %Working capital$2.0 $(109.6) $111.6 (102)%Working capital at the end of fiscal 2016 was higher than at the end of fiscal 2015 primarily due to a $152.4 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and a $53.2 million increase in accounts receivable. These changes in working capital were partially offset primarily due to a $117.6 million increase in deferred revenue.OtherOur available-for-sale securities as of October 31, 2016 consisted of investment-grade U.S. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and others. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer. As of October 31, 2016, we had no direct holdings in structured investment vehicles, sub-prime mortgage-backed securities or collateralized debt obligations and no exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds. During fiscal 2016, we had no impairment charge associated with our available-for-sale securities portfolio. While we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, we regularly review our investments and associated risk profiles, which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio. 41Table of ContentsWe proactively manage our cash equivalents and short-term investments balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents and fixed income portfolio, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. The majority of our investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. See Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our Revolver (defined below) will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.Other Commitments - Credit and Term Loan FacilitiesOn February 17, 2012, we entered into an agreement with several lenders (the Credit Agreement) providing for (i) a $350.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan). Principal payments on a portion of the Term Loan were due in equal quarterly installments of $7.5 million, with the remaining balance paid in October 2016. On May 19, 2015, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated in order to increase the size of the Revolver from $350.0 million to $500.0 million and to extend the termination date of the Revolver from October 14, 2016 to May 19, 2020. The amended and restated Credit Agreement also replaced a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum specified level of cash with a covenant requiring a minimum interest coverage ratio. Subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the amended and restated Credit Agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million through May 2019. The amended and restated Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of October 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.As of October 31, 2016, we had no outstanding balance under the Term Loan and a $205.0 million outstanding balance under the Revolver, which are considered short-term liabilities. As of October 31, 2015, we had a $45.0 million outstanding balance under the Term Loan and a $160.0 million outstanding balance under the Revolver, all of which are considered short-term liabilities. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the amended and restated Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2016, the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR +1.000%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment. The Credit Agreement was amended and restated on November 28, 2016. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details.

Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments in individual years beyond fiscal 2016 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents short-term investments and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2016, all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of these investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 43Table of ContentsThe following table presents our cash equivalents, short-term investments and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates:As of October 31, 2016 Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2017 2018 2019 Total Fair Value (in thousands)Cash & Cash equivalent (variable rate)$790,049 $— $— $790,049 $790,049Average interest rate0.33% —% —% Short-term investments (variable rate)$3,454 $3,708 $2,012 $9,174 $9,174Average interest rate1.43% 1.47% 1.63% Short-term investments (fixed rate)$106,213 $25,308 $— $131,521 $131,521Average interest rate1.27% 1.09% —% Short-term debt (variable rate) Revolver$205,000 $— $— $205,000 $205,000Average interest rateLIBOR +1.000% —% —% As of October 31, 2016, the stated maturities of our short-term investments which are classified as available for sale securities are: Fair Value (in thousands)Due in 1 year or less$94,439Due in 2-5 years46,219Due in 5-10 years37Total$140,695Actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. Realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities have not been material in any period presented. Foreign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2016, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $9.8 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $9.8 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based 44Table of Contentsexpenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $9.8 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.Net unrealized losses of approximately $19.9 million and $14.8 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. The following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2016: Gross NotionalAmount inU.S. Dollars AverageContractRate (in thousands) Forward Contract Values: Japanese yen$250,763 107.895Euro98,121 0.891Chinese renminbi 86,154 6.782Taiwanese dollar 65,367 32.128Indian Rupee 88,192 70.219Canadian dollar47,451 1.325Korean won 22,869 1,121.107British pound sterling 21,260 0.715Israeli shekel 24,942 3.793Armenian dram 16,522 463.633Swiss franc7,869 0.952Singapore dollar8,774 1.373Hungarian forint19,962 283.713 $758,246 Equity Risk. We have approximately $9.8 million and $10.3 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

883241,SNPS,SYNOPSYS INC,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements.Business SummarySynopsys, Inc. provides software, intellectual property, and services used by designers across the entire silicon tosoftware spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensurethe security and quality of their applications. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation(EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. We also offer intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than design those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. We are also a leading provider of software tools and services that are used to improve the security and quality of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, media, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials.30Table of ContentsOur EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, their research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. In addition, a number of consolidations have taken place in the semiconductor industry over the past several years. While we do not believe customer consolidations have had a material impact on our results, the future impact of ongoing consolidation is uncertain. For a discussion of potential risks, please see the risk factor titled “Consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results” in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.Despite global economic uncertainty, we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, but also because of our time-based revenue business model. Under this model, a substantial majority of our customers pay over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract, which averages approximately three years. Time-based revenue consists of time-based products, maintenance and service revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. Due to our business model, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.Our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, and driving growth in the software security and quality market. As we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market, for instance in the software security and quality space, and as hardware product sales grow, we expect to experience increased variability in our total revenue, though we expect time-based revenue to continue to represent at least 90% of all revenue other than hardware revenue. Overall, our business outlook remains solid based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy. We believe that these factors will help us continue to execute our strategies successfully.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. Fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 were 52-week years ending on October 28, 2017, October 29, 2016, and October 31, 2015, respectively. Fiscal 2018 will be a 53-week year.For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Fiscal 2017 Financial Performance SummaryIn fiscal 2017, compared to fiscal 2016, our financial performance reflects the following:•Revenues were $2.7 billion, an increase of $302.3 million or 12%, primarily driven by the overall growth in our business mainly due to higher TSL revenues, hardware sales, and professional services revenue. •Total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $2.4 billion, an increase of $272.2 million or 13%, primarily due to increases in headcount, including those from acquisitions. •Higher operating income of $347.6 million, an increase of $30.2 million or 10%.During fiscal 2017, 88% of our revenue was time-based. Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605).” This ASU requires an entity to recognize revenue when goods are transferred or services are provided to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 31Table of ContentsSince the issuance of Topic 606, the FASB has issued several amendments to the ASU, including deferral of the adoption date initially proposed, clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property, and identifying performance obligations.Topic 606 will be effective for us beginning in fiscal 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period. The ASU permits two retrospective methods for adoption. We will adopt Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method under which the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance is recognized at the date of initial application.Under the modified retrospective transition method, we will evaluate each contract that is effective on the adoption date as if that contract had been accounted for under Topic 606 from contract inception. Some revenue that would have been recognized in future periods under Topic 605 will be recast under Topic 606 as if the revenue had been recognized in prior periods. As this transition method requires that we do not adjust historical reported revenue amounts, the revenue that would have been recognized under this method prior to the adoption date will be a cumulative catch up adjustment to retained earnings and will not be recognized as revenue in future periods as previously planned. Because we expect that a slightly lower percentage of our revenue will be recognized over time under Topic 606, we expect to have a small percentage of our year-end backlog to be adjusted to retained earnings upon adoption.We derive the majority of our total revenue from Technology Subscription License (TSL) contracts. We believe that the promised licenses of software (i.e., functional intellectual property) and the promise to provide substantive, timely, and technologically relevant updates and services in our TSL contracts reflect inputs to a combined item that represents a single overall promise to provide customer access to a suite of EDA software in an integrated solution that will evolve as our customers’ industries evolve through rapid technology changes. Accordingly, we have concluded that this single overall promise will be recognized as revenue over the term of the contract period. Accordingly, we expect that there will be not be a material change in the nature and timing of revenue recognition for our TSL contracts under Topic 606.The timing of revenue recognition for our upfront products, maintenance and professional services is expected to remain substantially unchanged.We continue to assess all potential impacts of Topic 606 on other multiple element software arrangements that combine many software-related deliverables. As the requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements is not necessary to separate revenue from delivered software licenses, which is an essential criterion for separation under the current revenue standard, revenue would no longer be recognized over the arrangement period for certain of our term licenses and IP licenses. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of these changes on the remainder of our arrangements.Topic 606 also requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. This will require us to capitalize incremental costs such as commissions and other costs directly related to obtaining customer contracts and amortize those costs over the period the assets are expected to contribute future cash flows. As commissions paid for renewals are commensurate with the amounts paid for initial contracts, the deferred incremental costs will be recognized over the contract term. Under the existing rules, we expense commissions based on shipments.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" which supersedes the lease requirements in ""Leases (Topic 840)."" This ASU requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease payment liability for most leases in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. This ASU also makes some changes to lessor accounting and aligns with the new revenue recognition guidance. This ASU will be effective for fiscal 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” This ASU requires the immediate recognition of current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This ASU will be effective for fiscal 2019, including interim periods within that reporting period, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, ""Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities."" This ASU requires expanded hedge accounting for risk components and refining the measurement of hedge results to better reflect an entity's hedging strategies. This ASU also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how entities assess hedge effectiveness. This ASU will be 32Table of Contentseffective for fiscal 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition;•Valuation of business combinations;•Valuation of intangible assets; and•Income taxes.Revenue RecognitionWe generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses, maintenance and services, and to a lesser extent, hardware products. Software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products, and professional services fees. Hardware revenue consists of sales of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based emulation and prototyping products. Most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and additional meaningful rights that provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. Throughout the contract, our customers are typically using a myriad of products to complete each phase of a chip design and are concurrently working on multiple chip designs, or projects, in different phases of the design. During this time, the customer looks to us to release state-of-the-art technology as we keep up with the pace of change, to address requested enhancements to our tools to meet customer specifications, to provide support at each stage of the customer’s design, including the final manufacturing of the chip (the tape-out stage), and other important services. With respect to software licenses, we primarily utilize two license types: •Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs). TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. The majority of our arrangements are TSLs due to the nature of the business and customer requirements. In addition to the licenses, the arrangements also include: post-contract customer support, which includes providing frequent updates and upgrades to maintain the utility of the software due to rapid changes in technology; other intertwined services such as multiple copies of the tools; assisting our customers in applying our technology in their development environment; and rights to remix licenses for other licenses.•Perpetual licenses. Perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. For the two software license types, we recognize revenue as follows: •TSLs. We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. •Perpetual licenses. We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are 33Table of Contentsmet. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products, and professional services fees. We recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable, and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customers as needed. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations.Hardware revenue consists of sales of FPGA-based emulation and prototyping products. We recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations.We also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events, for example, royalty arrangements. We refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue.” Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs. Such revenue is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. These arrangements are not material to our total revenue. We infrequently enter into multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software deliverables such as hardware. We have determined that the software and non-software deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting. We recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type (TSL or perpetual license). Such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods. We also enter into arrangements to deliver software products, either alone or together with other products or services, that require significant modification or customization of the software. We account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues and costs. We measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project. Revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as ""maintenance and service revenue"" in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and software-related deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual licenses upon delivery using the residual method, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer. With respect to TSL arrangements, due to the complexity of the tools, the complexity of the arrangement terms and intertwined services, the license, maintenance and other services are not separable and are considered as a combined unit. Additionally, we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value to allocate the fee between these services. Therefore, we recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue recognition involves certain judgment; specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows: •Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and by us, or a 34Table of Contentspurchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement. •Delivery Has Occurred. We deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer’s hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically Freight on Board (FOB) shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter. •The Fee Is Fixed or Determinable. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual licenses require 75% or more of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers’ installments become due and payable. •Collectability Is Probable. We judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received.Valuation of Business CombinationsWe are required to allocate the purchase price to tangible assets, liabilities and contingencies assumed, and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets which are amortized over various estimated useful lives. Our estimates may include, but are not limited to, future cash flows of an acquired business, the appropriate discounted rate, and the cost savings expected to be derived from an acquisition. These estimates are inherently difficult, subjective and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price allocation to the acquired assets and liabilities could be different. In addition, we make judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions. These estimates are also inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates, the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different. Therefore, our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets and liabilities can have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Valuation of Intangible AssetsWe evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, covenants not to compete, capitalized software development, and in-process research and development. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material 35Table of Contentsadverse effect on our reported financial results. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.Income TaxesOur estimates and assumptions made in our tax provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved.We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse, and for tax loss and credit carryovers. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately $236.3 million, which are recorded on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2017 based on current tax law, will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset or a valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.We apply a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. An uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied.The calculation of tax liabilities involves inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws, significant assumptions, judgments and estimates including forward-looking financial projections and geographical mix of earnings. We are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, we would record an additional charge to earnings.Results of OperationsRevenue BackgroundWe generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses, maintenance and services, and to a lesser extent, hardware products. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses, services and hardware products at varying times. •In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered. The weighted-average term of the TSLs and term licenses is typically three years, but varies from quarter to quarter due to the nature and timing of the arrangements entered into during the quarter. The weighted-average term of the TSLs and term licenses we entered into in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 was 2.7 years, 3.0 years and 2.7 years, respectively. •Revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development. •Revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped and when title is transferred. •Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs.•Revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year).•Revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized as the services are performed. •Infrequently, we enter into certain license arrangements wherein licenses are provided for a finite term without any other services or rights, including rights to receive, or to exchange licensed 36Table of Contentssoftware for, unspecified future technology. We recognize revenue from these term licenses in full upon shipment of the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met.Our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our time-based products, upfront products, and maintenance and services revenues for the period. We derive time-based products revenue largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent from contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements. We derive upfront products revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period. We derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software, and not when they are booked. Our revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the 12 succeeding quarters. Conversely, a $120,000 order for perpetual licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered, but no future revenue. Additionally, revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fees and 100% of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable. Most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive EDA market. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total RevenueYear Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2017 2016 2015 2016 to 2017 2015 to 2016(dollars in millions)$2,724.9 $2,422.5 $2,242.2 $302.4 12% $180.3 8%The overall growth of our business, including contributions from acquisitions, has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of IP consulting projects, royalties, variability in hardware sales and due to certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due. As revenue from hardware sales is recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such hardware may result in increased variability of our total revenue.The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the overall growth in our business mainly due to higher TSL revenues, hardware sales, IP consulting projects and to a lesser extent due to revenue from acquired companies.The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our business mainly due to higher TSL revenues and hardware sales.37Table of ContentsTime-Based Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2017 2016 2015 2016 to 2017 2015 to 2016 (dollars in millions) $2,021.8 $1,910.9 $1,792.2 $110.9 6% $118.7 7%Percentage of total revenue74% 79% 80% The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods.The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to the overall growth in our business, including arrangements booked in prior periods and, to a lesser extent, contributions from acquisitions.Upfront Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2017 2016 2015 2016 to 2017 2015 to 2016 (dollars in millions) $338.2 $248.1 $197.3 $90.1 36% $50.8 26%Percentage of total revenue12% 10% 9% Changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, and for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of hardware products driven by timing of customer requirements.As our sales of hardware products grow, upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likelyfluctuate modestly.

The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our overall growth, including those from acquisitions, and related fixed charges including facilities, as well as higher product costs due to increased hardware sales. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, or fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs.Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2017 2016 2015 2016 to 2017 2015 to 2016 (dollars in millions)Cost of products revenue$413.2 $346.9 $303.6 $66.3 19 % $43.3 14 %Cost of maintenance and service revenue164.9 94.0 105.3 $70.9 75 % $(11.3) (11)%Amortization of intangible assets76.1 102.1 110.0 $(26.0) (25)% $(7.9) (7)%Total$654.2 $543.0 $518.9 $111.2 20 % $24.1 5 %Percentage of total revenue24% 22% 23% We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.Cost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. We expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions, but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue.39Table of ContentsAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to increases of $62.4 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, $37.5 million in hardware product costs due to increases in, and timing of, shipments, $24.8 million in costs related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by $8.6 million. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $26.0 million in amortization of intangible assets.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increases of $24.2 million in product costs due to increased sales, $19.7 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, which were partially offset by decreases of $13.4 million in costs related to our professional services revenue and $7.9 million in amortization of intangible assets.Changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Operating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2017 2016 2015 2016 to 2017 2015 to 2016 (dollars in millions) $908.8 $856.7 $776.2 $52.1 6% $80.5 10%Percentage of total revenue33% 35% 35% The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to increases of $47.4 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions.

Changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Change in Fair Value of Deferred CompensationThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete, and in-process research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years.

The restructuring actions were undertaken to position us for future growth, reallocate resources to priority areas and, to a lesser extent, eliminate operational redundancy. These charges consisted primarily of severance and retirement benefits. Payments under the 2017 restructuring plans are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018.During fiscal 2016, we recorded $9.6 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary employee terminations. As of October 31, 2016, there was a $5.7 million outstanding balance remaining in 41Table of Contentsaccounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The remaining balance was paid in fiscal 2017.During fiscal 2015, we recorded $15.1 million of restructuring charges pursuant to the fiscal 2015 restructuring program, which included a voluntary retirement program (VRP) and a minimal headcount reduction program. The fiscal 2015 restructuring program was completed as of October 31, 2015.The following is a summary of our restructuring activities:Fiscal YearBalance at Beginning of Period Costs Incurred (Reduced) Cash Payments Balance at End of Period (in millions)2017$5.7 $36.6 $(24.8) $17.52016$— $9.6 $(3.9) $5.72015$— $15.1 $(15.1) $—See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2017 2016 2015 2016 to 2017 2015 to 2016 (dollars in millions)Interest income$7.2 $3.7 $2.8 $3.5 95 % $0.9 32 %Interest expense(7.3) (3.8) (2.8) (3.5) 92 % (1.0) 36 %Gain (loss) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan29.6 4.4 3.7 25.2 573 % 0.7 19 %Foreign currency exchange gain (loss)3.4 0.2 6.3 3.2 1,600 % (6.1) (97)%Other, net2.6 7.7 5.1 (5.1) (66)% 2.6 51 %Total$35.5 $12.2 $15.1 $23.3 191 % $(2.9) (19)%The net increase in other income (expense) in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.The net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower gains in foreign currency exchange as a result of the weakened U.S. dollar against the related foreign currencies, partially offset by increased income on foreign exchange hedging contracts that was recorded in Other, net. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 64.4%, which included income tax expense of $166.2 million relating to a repatriation of foreign earnings of $825 million in anticipation of potential U.S. corporate tax reform, $30.5 million due to an increase in valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets, a settlement with the Korean National Tax Service for the audit of fiscal years 2012 to 2016 of $7.9 million, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $36.4 million. These expenses were partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $38.1 million, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $25.5 million, and a settlement with the Taiwanese tax authorities for fiscal 2014 of $10.9 million. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 19.0%, which included tax benefits from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of $20.7 million for fiscal 2015 and the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. federal research tax credit of approximately $37.1 million, partially offset by tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of $37.5 million, the impact of undistributed foreign earnings of $9.6 million, and an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $14.0 million as a result of changes in the expected utilization of state tax credits. The reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2015 and the full year of fiscal 2016, which was recorded in fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 19.8%, which included tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of $33.0 million partially offset by tax benefits from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research tax credit of approximately $12.4 million, a settlement with the IRS of $4.0 million for fiscal 2014, and a 42Table of Contentssettlement with the Taiwanese tax authorities of $2.3 million (net tax benefit resulting from fiscal years 2012 and 2013). The reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2014 as well as two months of fiscal 2015, which was recorded in fiscal 2015. The integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among company-controlled entities. The income tax effect is generally recognized over five years. These intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a company-controlled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition. The valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets increased in fiscal 2017 by $43.7 million primarily due to a change in the realizability of deferred tax assets related to the California research credit carryforwards. Most of the change relates to a significant increase in our share price in fiscal 2017, which resulted in a higher tax deduction that reduced the future California sourced taxable income and the amount of California research credits we expect to utilize. The remainder of the increase relates to an agreement that we reached with the California tax authorities in fiscal 2017, which resulted primarily in the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits offset by a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance of $13.2 million. For further discussion of the provision for income taxes, repatriation, and settlements, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. As of October 31, 2017, we held an aggregate of $554.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and an aggregate of $493.8 million in our foreign subsidiaries. In fiscal 2017, we repatriated $825 million of undistributed foreign earnings in anticipation of U.S. corporate tax reform. Additional amounts held outside the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. (subject to local law restrictions), but under current U.S. tax law, would be subject to U.S. income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. We have provided for the U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on foreign earnings, except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. However, in the event additional funds from foreign subsidiaries were needed to fund cash needs in the U.S. and if U.S. taxes have not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds.The following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow, and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2017.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2017 2016 (dollars in millions)Cash and cash equivalents$1,048.4 $976.6 $71.8 7 %Short-term investments$— $140.7 $(140.7) (100)%Total$1,048.4 $1,117.3 $(68.9) (6)%Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased primarily due to (1) stock repurchases under our accelerated stock repurchase agreements, (2) cash used for acquisitions and intangible assets, (3) purchases of property and equipment, (4) repayment of debt, net of proceeds, and (5) payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards. Cash used was partially offset by cash generated from our operations and cash received from employee stock option exercises.43Table of ContentsCash Flows Year Ended October 31, $ Change $ Change 2017 2016 2015 2016 to 2017 2015 to 2016 (dollars in millions)Cash provided by operating activities$634.6 $586.6 $495.2 $48.0 $91.4Cash used in investing activities(189.3) (142.7) (559.6) (46.6) 416.9Cash used in financing activities(373.1) (306.9) (62.1) (66.2) (244.8)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.Fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections, partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesFiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets of $199.1 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments of $139.3 million.Fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by lower cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets of $280.1 million, lower purchases of short-term investments of $70.2 million, higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments of $47.2 million, and lower purchases of property and equipment of $20.1 million.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesFiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher debt repayments of $195.6 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the drawdown of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $135.0 million.Fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the drawdown of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $275.0 million and higher stock repurchase activities of $120.0 million, partially offset by lower debt repayments of $145.4 million.Accounts Receivable, netYear Ended October 31, 2017 2016 $ Change % Change(dollars in millions) $451.1 $438.9 $12.2 3%Our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding (DSO) are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities. Our DSO was 59 days at October 31, 2017 and 63 days at October 31, 2016. The decrease in DSO is primarily due to the increase in revenue.44Table of ContentsWorking Capital Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets: Year Ended October 31, 2017 2016 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets$1,682.6 $1,716.9 $(34.3) (2)%Current liabilities1,614.1 1,714.9 $(100.8) (6)%Working capital$68.5 $2.0 $66.5 3,325 %Working capital at the end of fiscal 2017 was higher than at the end of fiscal 2016 primarily due to (1) a decrease of $195.1 million in short-term debt, (2) an increase of $30.2 million in prepaid and other current assets, and (3) a decrease of $21.3 million in deferred revenue. These changes in working capital were partially offset by an increase of $98.4 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease of $69.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as we sold our available-for-sale investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.OtherAs of October 31, 2017, our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. We proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. The majority of our investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. See Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our Revolver (defined below) will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.Other Commitments — Credit and Term Loan FacilitiesOn November 28, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders (the Credit Agreement) providing for (i) a $650.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan). The Credit Agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated May 19, 2015 (the 2015 Agreement), in order to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $500.0 million to $650.0 million, provide a new $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility, and extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from May 19, 2020 to November 28, 2021. Subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the Credit Agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of October 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we received funding of $150.0 million under the Term Loan. As of October 31, 2017, we had a $144.0 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan, of which $134.1 million is classified as long-term liabilities, and no outstanding balance under the Revolver. Outstanding principal payments under the Term Loan are due as follows:Fiscal year(in thousands)201810,313201914,062202017,813202127,187202275,000Total$144,37545Table of ContentsAs of October 31, 2016, we had no outstanding balance under the previous term loan from the 2015 Agreement and a $205.0 million outstanding balance under the previous revolver from the 2015 Agreement, all of which are considered short-term liabilities. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2017, borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR +1.000%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.Subsequent to fiscal year 2017, we drew down $450.0 million under the Revolver and the total outstanding balance of the Revolver as of December 13, 2017 is $450.0 million.Acquisition of Black Duck Software. On November 2, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire privately held Black Duck Software, a leader in automated solutions for securing and managing open source software. The acquisition was completed on December 11, 2017 and under the terms of the definitive agreement, we paid approximately $547 million, net of cash acquired, and assumed certain unvested equity of Black Duck employees. The transaction was funded by U.S. cash.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 31, 2017: Total Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2019/ Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021/ Fiscal 2022 Thereafter Other (in thousands) Lease Obligations: Operating Leases(1)354,329 56,879 90,944 59,235 147,271 —Purchase Obligations(2)172,583 107,327 65,256 — — —Term Loan(3)144,375 10,312 31,875 102,188 — —Other Long-Term Obligations(4)3,450 863 1,725 862 — —Long term accrued income taxes(5)33,239 — — — — 33,239Total$707,976 $175,381 $189,800 $162,285 $147,271 $33,239(1)See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2017. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.(3)This commitment relates to the principal on the Term Loan as discussed in Other Commitments above.(4)These other obligations include fees associated with our Revolver.(5)Long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2017. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments in individual years beyond fiscal 2017 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

As of October 31, 2017, all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of these investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. The following table presents our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates:As of October 31, 2017 Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Total Fair Value (in thousands)Cash & Cash equivalent (variable rate)$924,839 $— $— $924,839 $924,839Average interest rate0.78% —% —% Term Loan$10,313 $14,062 $17,813 $27,187 $75,000 $144,375 $144,375Average interest rateLIBOR +1.125% —% —% Actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. Realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities have not been material in any period presented. Foreign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2017, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $10.4 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $10.4 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $10.4 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.Net unrealized gain of approximately $4.4 million and loss of $19.9 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.47Table of ContentsIf estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements.

We have approximately $7.8 million and $9.8 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of October 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. Investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. We recorded $1.3 million of other-than-temporary impairment during fiscal 2017 and did not recognize any impairment during fiscal 2016. None of our investments are held for speculation purposes.48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:30:21.515054
883241,SNPS,SYNOPSYS INC,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business SummarySynopsys, Inc. provides products and services used by designers across the entire silicon to software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. We also offer semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. We 28Table of Contentsare also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security and quality of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, media, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials.Our EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, their research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. In addition, a number of consolidations have taken place in the semiconductor industry over the past several years. While we do not believe customer consolidations have had a material impact on our results, the future impact of ongoing consolidation is uncertain. For a discussion of potential risks, please see the risk factor titled “Consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.Despite global economic uncertainty, we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, but also because of our time-based revenue business model. Under this model, a substantial majority of our customers pay over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract, which averages approximately three years. Time-based revenue consists of time-based products, maintenance and service revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. Due to our business model, decreases or increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.Our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, and driving growth in the software security and quality market. As we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market, for instance in the software security and quality space, and as hardware product sales grow, we expect to experience increased variability in our total revenue. In addition, due to our adoption of Topic 606 in fiscal 2019, as further described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements will increase the variability in our total revenue from period to period. Nevertheless, this accounting impact will not affect our cash generation or change the way we operate our business. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. Fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and ended on November 3, 2018. Fiscal 2017 and 2016 were 52-week years ending on October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016, respectively. Fiscal 2019 will be a 52-week year.For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Fiscal 2018 Financial Performance SummaryIn fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017, our financial performance reflects the following:•Revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of $396.2 million or 15%, primarily driven by the overall growth in our business mainly due to higher TSL revenue, acquisitions, and professional services revenue. The increase also included additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to the extra week in fiscal 2018; •Total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $2.8 billion, an increase of $383.5 million or 16%, primarily due to increases in headcount, including those from acquisitions. The increase also included one additional week of expenses of approximately $33.7 million;•Higher operating income of $360.2 million, an increase of $12.7 million or 4%; and•Benefit for income taxes of $69.0 million in fiscal 2018 compared to provision for income taxes of $246.5 million in fiscal 2017, primarily due to the expense recorded for repatriation in fiscal 2017, 29Table of Contentscompared to the benefit recorded for restructuring of foreign IP rights, and a decrease in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in fiscal 2018.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition;•Valuation of business combinations; and•Income taxes.Revenue RecognitionWe generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses and to a lesser extent, hardware products, maintenance and services. Time-based products revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products, and professional services fees. Upfront products revenue includes hardware revenue consisting of sales of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based emulation and prototyping products and perpetual software licenses. Most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and additional meaningful rights that provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. Throughout the contract, our customers are typically using a myriad of products to complete each phase of a chip design and are concurrently working on multiple chip designs, or projects, in different phases of the design. During this time, the customer looks to us to release state-of-the-art technology as we keep up with the pace of change, to address requested enhancements to our tools to meet customer specifications, to provide support at each stage of the customer’s design, including the final manufacturing of the chip (the tape-out stage), and other important services. With respect to software licenses, we primarily utilize two license types: •Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs). TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer with limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. The majority of our arrangements are TSLs due to the nature of the business and customer requirements. In addition to the licenses, the arrangements also include: post-contract customer support, which includes providing frequent updates and upgrades to maintain the utility of the software due to rapid changes in technology; other intertwined services such as multiple copies of the tools; assistance to our customers in applying our technology in their development environment; and rights to remix licenses for other licenses.•Perpetual licenses. Perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. For the two software license types, we recognize revenue as follows: •TSLs. We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. •Perpetual licenses. We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of 30Table of Contentsthe maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Our maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual licenses and hardware products, and professional services fees. We recognize revenue from maintenance arrangements ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable, and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customers as needed. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations.Hardware revenue consists of sales of FPGA-based emulation and prototyping products. We recognize revenue from sales of hardware products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations.We also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events, such as royalty arrangements. We refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue.” Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs. Such revenue is reported as “time-based products revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. These arrangements are not material to our total revenue. We infrequently enter into multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software deliverables such as hardware. We have determined that the software and non-software deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting. We recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type (TSL or perpetual license). Such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods. We also enter into arrangements to deliver software products, either alone or together with other products or services, that require significant modification or customization of the software. We account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues and costs. We measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project. Revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as ""maintenance and service revenue"" in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and software-related deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual licenses upon delivery using the residual method, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer. With respect to TSL arrangements, due to the complexity of the tools, the complexity of the arrangement terms and intertwined services, the license, maintenance and other services are not separable and are considered as a combined unit. Additionally, we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value to allocate the fee between these services. Therefore, we recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue recognition involves certain judgments. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows: •Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and by us, or a 31Table of Contentspurchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement. •Delivery Has Occurred. We deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer’s hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically Freight on Board (FOB) shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter. •The Fee Is Fixed or Determinable. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual licenses require 75% or more of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers’ installments become due and payable. •Collectability Is Probable. We judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received.Valuation of Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets, liabilities including contingencies assumed, and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Any excess fair value of purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make estimates and assumptions, based in part on our judgments, in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates and assumptions may include, but are not limited to, future cash flows of an acquired business, other assumptions and the appropriate discount rate. These estimates are inherently difficult, subjective and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the fair value allocation to the acquired intangible assets could be different. Therefore, our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these assets can have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.32Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse, and for tax loss and credit carryovers. Determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets require assumptions, judgments, and estimates. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. In fiscal 2018, we also considered the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately $397.4 million, which are recorded on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2018, based on current tax law, will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset or a valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period that such determination is made.Uncertain tax positions are recorded by applying a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. An uncertain tax position is considered effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied.Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedSee Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of OperationsRevenue BackgroundWe generate our revenue from the sale of products that include software licenses, maintenance and services, and to a lesser extent, hardware products. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses, services and hardware products at varying times. •In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order over the license term and on a perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered. The weighted-average term of the TSLs is typically three years, but varies from quarter to quarter due to the nature and timing of the arrangements entered into during the quarter. The weighted-average term of the TSLs we entered into in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 was 2.7 years, 2.7 years and 3.0 years, respectively. •Revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of modification or development. •Revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped and when title is transferred. •Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the event that removes the contingency occurs.•Revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year).•Revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized as the services are performed. •Infrequently, we enter into certain license arrangements wherein licenses are provided for a finite term without any other services or rights, including rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. We recognize revenue from these term licenses in full upon shipment of the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met.33Table of ContentsOur revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our time-based products, upfront products, and maintenance and services revenues for the period. We derive time-based products revenue largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent from contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements. We derive upfront products revenue directly from perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period. We derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software, and not when they are booked. Our revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the 12 succeeding quarters. Conversely, a $120,000 order for perpetual licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered, but no future revenue. Additionally, revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fees and 100% of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable. Most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive EDA market. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total RevenueYear Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017(dollars in millions)$3,121.1 $2,724.9 $2,422.5 $396.2 15% $302.4 12%The overall growth of our business, including contributions from acquisitions, has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of IP consulting projects, royalties, and variability in hardware sales, and due to certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due. As revenue from hardware sales is recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such hardware may result in increased variability of our total revenue.The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our business, mainly due to higher TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, an increase in professional services, additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and contributions from acquired companies.The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the overall growth of our business mainly due to higher TSL revenues, hardware sales, and IP consulting projects and, to a lesser extent, due to revenue from acquired companies.For a discussion of revenue by geographic areas, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.34Table of ContentsTime-Based Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions) $2,303.3 $2,021.8 $1,910.9 $281.5 14% $110.9 6%Percentage of total revenue74% 74% 79% The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods, including contributions from acquired companies, and additional revenue due to an extra week in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods.Upfront Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions) $357.7 $338.2 $248.1 $19.5 6% $90.1 36%Percentage of total revenue11% 12% 10% Changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of IP products driven by higher demand from customers.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of hardware products driven by timing of customer requirements.Upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate modestly based on the timing of IP products and hardware sales.

The increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in, and the timing of, IP consulting projects that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method and contributions from acquisitions. 35Table of ContentsCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions)Cost of revenue$735.9 $654.2 $543.0 $81.7 12% $111.2 20%Operating expenses2,024.9 1,723.1 1,562.2 301.8 18% 160.9 10%Total$2,760.8 $2,377.3 $2,105.2 $383.5 16% $272.1 13%Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue88% 87% 87% Our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnel-related costs including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and variable compensation; changes in amortization; and changes in selling and marketing expenses. The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our overall growth, including those from acquisitions, and related fixed charges including facilities, as well as higher product costs due to increased hardware sales. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, or fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs.Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions)Cost of products revenue$448.4 $413.2 $346.9 $35.2 9% $66.3 19 %Cost of maintenance and service revenue203.5 164.9 94.0 38.6 23% 70.9 75 %Amortization of intangible assets84.0 76.1 102.1 7.9 10% (26.0) (25)%Total$735.9 $654.2 $543.0 $81.7 12% $111.2 20 %Percentage of total revenue24% 24% 22% We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.Cost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. We expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions, but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue.36Table of ContentsAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $47.7 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, an increase of $11.3 million in costs related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, and an increase of $7.9 million in amortization of intangible assets, as well as one additional week of expenses of approximately $4.5 million.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $62.4 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, an increase of $37.5 million in hardware product costs due to increases in, and timing of, shipments, an increase of $24.8 million in costs related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, and functionally allocated expenses that were higher by $8.6 million. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $26.0 million in amortization of intangible assets.Changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Operating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions) $1,084.8 $908.8 $856.7 $176.0 19% $52.1 6%Percentage of total revenue35% 33% 35% The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $114.4 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, and one additional week of expenses of approximately $19.3 million.The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $47.4 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions.

The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase of $40.8 million in personnel costs as a result of higher headcount and higher variable compensation primarily based on timing of shipments.

The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase of $38.0 million for accrued loss contingencies as a result of litigation, an increase of $18.8 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, and an increase of $5.5 million in facilities expenses, partially offset by a $30.4 million gain as a result of a legal settlement.Changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Change in Fair Value of Deferred CompensationThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, and in-process research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years. Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions)Included in cost of revenue$84.0 $76.1 $102.1 $7.9 10% $(26.0) (25)%Included in operating expenses41.6 31.6 27.5 10.0 32% 4.1 15 %Total$125.6 $107.7 $129.6 $17.9 17% $(21.9) (17)%Percentage of total revenue4% 4% 5% The increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the additions of acquired intangible assets, partially offset by certain intangible assets being fully amortized.The decrease in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to intangible assets that were fully amortized, partially offset by additions of acquired intangible assets.Restructuring ChargesDuring fiscal 2018, we recorded $12.9 million of restructuring charges as part of a business realignment. The restructuring actions were undertaken to position us for future growth, reallocate resources to priority areas and, to a lesser extent, eliminate operational redundancy. These charges consisted primarily of severance and benefits. The remaining balance of $8.1 million is expected to be paid in fiscal 2019.38Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2017, we recorded $36.6 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary and voluntary employee termination actions. The restructuring actions were undertaken to position us for future growth, reallocate resources to priority areas and, to a lesser extent, eliminate operational redundancy. These charges consisted primarily of severance and retirement benefits. As of the end of fiscal 2018, there were no unpaid balances remaining of the 2017 restructuring charges.During fiscal 2016, we recorded $9.6 million of restructuring charges for severance and benefits due to involuntary employee terminations, which was fully paid in fiscal 2017.The following is a summary of our restructuring activities:Fiscal YearBalance at Beginning of Period Costs Incurred (Reduced) Cash Payments Others Balance at End of Period (in millions)2018$17.5 $12.9 $(22.1) $(0.2) $8.12017$5.7 $36.6 $(24.8) $— $17.52016$— $9.6 $(3.9) $— $5.7See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions)Interest income$5.3 $7.2 $3.7 $(1.9) (26)% $3.5 95 %Interest expense(15.6) (7.3) (3.8) (8.3) 114 % (3.5) 92 %Gain (loss) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan4.6 29.6 4.4 (25.0) (84)% 25.2 573 %Foreign currency exchange gain (loss)3.6 3.4 0.2 0.2 6 % 3.2 1,600 %Other, net5.4 2.6 7.7 2.8 108 % (5.1) (66)%Total$3.3 $35.5 $12.2 $(32.2) (91)% $23.3 191 %The net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to lower gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and higher interest expense due to a higher debt balance.The net increase in other income (expense) in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher gains in the market value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.Income TaxesThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), enacted on December 22, 2017, lowered the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018. Because our fiscal 2018 commenced on November 1, 2017, the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate applicable to fiscal 2018 is a blended rate of 23.4%. Beginning in fiscal 2019, our annual statutory federal corporate tax rate will be 21%.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was (19.0%), which included a tax benefit of $172.0 million relating to the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $35.1 million, a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of $21.8 million tax benefit for fiscal 2017, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $31.0 million. These benefits were partially offset by tax expense of $63.1 million for a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings, $51.1 million due to re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $27.9 million. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 64.4%, which included income tax expense of $166.2 million relating to a repatriation of foreign earnings of $825 million, $30.5 million due to an increase in valuation allowance on state 39Table of Contentsdeferred tax assets, a settlement with the Korean National Tax Service for the audit of fiscal years 2012 to 2016 of $7.9 million, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $36.4 million. These expenses were partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $38.1 million, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $25.5 million, and a settlement with the Taiwanese tax authorities for fiscal 2014 of $10.9 million. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 19.0%, which included tax benefits from a settlement with the IRS of $20.7 million for fiscal 2015 and the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. federal research tax credit of approximately $37.1 million, partially offset by tax expense from the integration of acquired technologies of $37.5 million, the impact of undistributed foreign earnings of $9.6 million, and an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $14.0 million as a result of changes in the expected utilization of state tax credits. The reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2015 and the full year of fiscal 2016, which was recorded in fiscal 2016. The integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among company-controlled entities. The income tax effect is generally recognized over five years. These intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a company-controlled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition. During the year, we made provisional estimates of the accounting impacts of certain provisions of the Tax Act. In the fourth quarter, as a result of further analyzes of certain aspects of the Tax Act, we have finalized the following provisional estimates.As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, we remeasured our deferred taxes, resulting in a first-quarter provisional tax expense of $45.6 million based on the tax rate that will apply when these deferred taxes are settled or realized in future periods. In the fourth quarter, we finalized our calculations resulting in a tax expense for fiscal 2018 of $51.1 million.As part of the adoption of a new territorial tax system, the Tax Act required us to pay a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. As of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we had recorded a provisional transition tax expense of $73.4 million, as well as a provisional income tax payable of $17.9 million. In the fourth quarter, we finalized our calculations resulting in a tax expense of $63.1 million and income tax payable of $8.9 million. We intend to elect to pay the transition tax over a period of eight years as permitted by the Tax Act.We continue to obtain, analyze and interpret additional guidance issued related to the Tax Act. The applicability and impact of the following new tax provisions, are dependent in part on forthcoming IRS guidance. •A tax on global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), which is determined annually based on our aggregate foreign subsidiaries' income in excess of certain qualified business asset investment return, will be effective for us in fiscal year 2019. We need additional information to complete our analysis on whether to adopt an accounting policy to account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that we are subject to such tax, or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal, may be subject to such tax. Accordingly, we have not recorded any tax or deferred tax assets or liabilities with respect to GILTI in fiscal year 2018. We will make our accounting policy decision and complete the required accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.•A base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which functions as a minimum tax that partially disallows deductions for certain related party transactions, that is not effective for us until fiscal year 2019.•A special tax deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), which, in general, allows a deduction of certain intangible income earned in the U.S. and derived from foreign sources, that is not effective for us until fiscal year 2019.As part of the adoption of a territorial tax system, the Tax Act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.In the fourth quarter of 2018, we made significant changes to our international tax structure by transferring intangible assets between certain foreign subsidiaries and changing the tax status of these subsidiaries for U.S. tax purposes. As a result, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $172.0 million for the future U.S. tax deduction related 40Table of Contentsto these intangible assets. We paid foreign income tax of $67.7 million associated with the gain recognized on certain of these transactions. The tax liabilities associated with these transfers are treated as prepaid taxes. A portion of these foreign taxes may result in a U.S. foreign tax credit, but the amount expected to be realized cannot be determined at this time. The tax liabilities and benefits are subject to examination by U.S. and foreign tax authorities in future years.In fiscal 2018, we reevaluated our strategy and subsequently withdrew our contest concerning the Hungary tax litigation related to one issue in the audit of fiscal years 2011 through 2013 and recorded a tax expense of $5.7 million. For further discussion of the provision for income taxes, impacts related to the Tax Act, the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights and the Hungary audit, see Note 11 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. As of October 31, 2018, we held an aggregate of $177.6 million in cash and cash equivalents in the United States and an aggregate of $545.5 million in our foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Tax Act, we have recorded a tax liability for the transition tax on foreign earnings, payable over eight years, of $0.7 million and $8.2 million reflected as a short-term and long-term liability, respectively. If we decide to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the U.S. in the future, the earnings that were subject to the transition tax would not be subject to further U.S. tax. In addition, we have provided foreign deferred taxes on our undistributed earnings sufficient to address the incremental tax that would be due on future foreign earnings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we completed a restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights, resulting in a one-time tax payment of $67.7 million, which is included in current prepaid taxes.The following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow, and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2018.Cash and Cash Equivalents Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2018 2017 (dollars in millions)Cash and cash equivalents$723.1 $1,048.4 $(325.3) (31)%Cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to cash used for business combinations and asset acquisitions, and stock repurchases under our accelerated stock repurchase agreements, partially offset by cash from our operations and net proceeds from our credit facilities.Cash Flows Year Ended October 31, $ Change $ Change 2018 2017 2016 2017 to 2018 2016 to 2017 (dollars in millions)Cash provided by operating activities$424.2 $634.6 $586.6 $(210.4) $48.0Cash used in investing activities(743.5) (189.3) (142.7) (554.2) (46.6)Cash provided by (used in) financing activities5.1 (373.1) (306.9) 378.2 (66.2)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.41Table of ContentsFiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher vendor disbursements, higher income taxes payment, higher accounts receivable due to timing of customer billings, and higher inventory. Disbursements in fiscal 2018 included certain one-time payments of $163.3 million for income taxes and $65.0 million for a litigation settlement. Fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash collections, partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesFiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions of $393.4 million and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, of $128.1 million.Fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets of $199.1 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments of $139.3 million.Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing ActivitiesFiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Cash provided by financing activity in fiscal 2018 was higher compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher proceeds of $300.6 million from drawdowns of our credit facilities and lower debt repayment of $85.3 million.Fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher debt repayments of $195.6 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the drawdown of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $135.0 million.Accounts Receivable, netYear Ended October 31, 2018 2017 $ Change % Change(dollars in millions) $554.2 $451.1 $103.1 23%Changes in our accounts receivable balance are primarily driven by timing of customer billing, collection activities and to a lesser extent, customer receivables acquired through our acquisitions.Working Capital Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets: Year Ended October 31, 2018 2017 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets$1,543.8 $1,682.6 $(138.8) (8)%Current liabilities2,102.4 1,614.1 488.3 30 %Working capital (deficit)$(558.6) $68.5 $(627.1) (915)%Decreases in our working capital were primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $325.3 million, an increase in short term debt of $333.8 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $88.3 million, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $78.5 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $103.1 million, an increase in inventory of $60.5 million, and an increase in income taxes receivable and prepaid taxes of $28.3 million.OtherAs of October 31, 2018, our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. We proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, 42Table of Contentswith our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. The majority of our investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. See Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our Revolver (defined below) will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.Other Commitments — Credit and Term Loan FacilitiesIn July 2018, we entered into a 220.0 million RMB (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support our facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the Chinese Central Bank rate plus 10% of such rate. As of October 31, 2018, we had $5.5 million outstanding under the agreement. On November 28, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders (the Credit Agreement) providing for (i) a $650.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan). The Credit Agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated May 19, 2015 (the 2015 Agreement), in order to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $500.0 million to $650.0 million, provide a new $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility, and extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from May 19, 2020 to November 28, 2021. Subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the Credit Agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of October 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.As of October 31, 2018, we had $133.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan, of which $120.0 million was classified as long-term liabilities. Outstanding principal payments under the Term Loan are due as follows:Fiscal year(in thousands)2019$14,062202017,813202127,187202275,000Total$134,062As of October 31, 2017, we had $144.0 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term loan, of which $134.1 million was classified as long-term liabilities, and no outstanding balance under the Revolver.The total outstanding balance of the Revolver as of October 31, 2018 was $330.0 million, which was included in short-term liabilities. We expect the borrowings under the Revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2018, borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR +1.000%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.Subsequent to fiscal year 2018, we drew down $150.0 million under the Revolver. The total outstanding balance of the Revolver as of December 14, 2018 is $430.0 million, net of repayments.43Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 31, 2018: Total Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2020/ Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022/ Fiscal 2023 Thereafter Other (in thousands) Lease Obligations: Operating Leases(1)$589,900 $61,819 $116,784 $93,162 $318,135 $—Purchase Obligations(2)456,823 272,979 183,526 318 — —Revolver(3)335,535 335,535 — — — —Term Loan(3)134,062 14,062 45,000 75,000 — —Other Long-Term Obligations(4)2,588 863 1,725 — — —Long term accrued income taxes(5)50,590 — 1,429 1,429 5,357 42,375Total$1,569,498 $685,258 $348,464 $169,909 $323,492 $42,375(1)See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2018. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.(3)These commitments relate to the principal of the Revolver, the Term Loan, and a credit facility as discussed in Other Commitments above.(4)These other obligations include fees associated with our Revolver. (5)Long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits and transition tax liability as of October 31, 2018. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2018 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2018, all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of these investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 44Table of ContentsThe following table presents our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates:As of October 31, 2018 Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2019 2020 2021 2021 2022 Total Fair Value (in thousands)Cash & Cash equivalent (variable rate)$574,959 $574,959 $574,959Average interest rate0.93% Short-term debt (variable rate): Revolver$330,000 $330,000 $330,000Average interest rateLIBOR +1.000% Term Loan$14,062 $17,813 $27,187 $75,000 $134,062 $134,062Average interest rateLIBOR +1.125% Credit Facility in China$5,535 $5,535 $5,535Average interest rateChinese Central Bank rate + 10% of such rate Foreign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2018, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $12.4 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $12.4 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $12.4 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.Net unrealized loss of approximately $23.9 million and gain of $4.4 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 45Table of ContentsThe following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2018: Gross NotionalAmount inU.S. Dollars AverageContractRate (in thousands) Forward Contract Values: Japanese yen$291,495 109.506Hungarian forint188,192 284.365Indian rupee131,679 71.319Euro124,091 1.206Chinese renminbi113,860 6.756Taiwanese dollar85,383 29.476Canadian dollar56,496 1.282Korean won41,342 1,124.225Israeli shekel36,100 3.604British pound sterling28,247 1.359Armenian dram20,967 475.367Singapore dollar9,224 1.368Swiss franc8,473 0.953 $1,135,549 Equity Risk.

883241,SNPS,SYNOPSYS INC,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following overview of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7, the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business SummarySynopsys, Inc. provides products and services used across the entire silicon to software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. We also offer semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. These products and services are part of our Semiconductor & System Design segment.We are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security and quality of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, media, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials. These tools and services are part of our Software Integrity segment.Our EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets, and our customers' spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. Our Software Integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code - while it is being written - for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance. Our Software Integrity customers are software developers across many industries, including, but also well beyond, the semiconductor and systems industries. Our Software Integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.Despite global economic uncertainty, we have consistently grown our revenue since 2005. We achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships. We recognize our revenue for the software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. For discussion on our revenue recognition policy, please see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Time-based revenue consists of time-based products, maintenance and service revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way. Our growth strategy is based on building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, and driving growth in the software security and quality market. As we continue to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market, for instance in the software security and quality space, and as hardware product sales grow, we expect to experience increased variability in our total revenue. In addition, due to our adoption of Accounting Standard Codification 606 (ASC 606), ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"", in the beginning of fiscal 2019, as further described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements has increased the variability in our total revenue from period to period. Nevertheless, the accounting impact has not affected our cash generated from our business. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.Business Segments29Table of ContentsEffective in fiscal 2019, we realigned our business to evaluate the results of our Software Integrity business separately from our traditional EDA and semiconductor IP business. The Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODMs) now regularly review disaggregated information for the following two reportable segments: (1) Semiconductor & System Design, which includes EDA tools, IP products, system integration solutions and other revenue categories, and (2) Software Integrity, which includes a comprehensive solution for building integrity—security, quality and compliance testing—into our customers’ software development lifecycle and supply chain. Our historical results have been recast to retrospectively reflect the change from one to two reportable segments. As a result of the change in reporting structure, financial information provided to and used by the CODMs to assist in making operational decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance reflects consolidated financial information as well as revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating margin for the Semiconductor & System Design and Software Integrity segments, accompanied by disaggregated information relating to revenues by geographic region. Semiconductor & System Design. This segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services, and semiconductor IP portfolio, which encompasses products and services that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. EDA includes digital, custom IC design and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design software, verification products, and manufacturing software products. Designers use these products to automate the IC design process and to reduce errors. For IP, we are a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven IP solutions for system-on-chips (SoCs). This includes IP that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, internet of things, and cloud computing markets, enabling designers to quickly develop SoCs in these areas.Software Integrity. This segment includes a broad portfolio of products and services such as leading quality testing technologies, automated analysis, and consulting experts. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we launched the Polaris Software Integrity Platform™, an integrated cloud-based solution that unites key elements to provide an even more valuable way for developers to better develop personalized approaches for open source license compliance and detect and remediate known security vulnerabilities and quality defects early in the development process, thereby minimizing risk and maximizing productivity.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and ended on November 3, 2018. Fiscal 2019 and 2017 were 52-week years ending on November 2, 2019 and October 28, 2017, respectively. Fiscal 2020 will be a 52-week year.For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Fiscal 2019 Financial Performance SummaryWe adopted new revenue guidance, ASC 606, at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense. The comparative information for periods prior to fiscal 2019 has not been restated. Additional comparative information is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the adoption of ASC 606 and our pro-forma financial results under Accounting Standards Codification 605 (ASC 605), ""Revenue Recognition"", for fiscal 2019.In fiscal 2019, compared to fiscal 2018, our financial performance reflects the following:•Revenues were $3.4 billion, an increase of $239.6 million or 8%, primarily due to our continued growth organically, as well as the adoption of ASC 606, partially offset by additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to the extra week in fiscal 2018; •Total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $2.8 billion, an increase of $79.6 million or 3%, primarily due to increases in restructuring costs of $34.2 million and employee-related costs of $81.3 million, resulting from increases in headcount, partially offset by a litigation settlement in fiscal 2018 of $26.0 million and a legal settlement in our favor in fiscal 2019 of $18.3 million; •Operating income of $520.2 million, an increase of $160.0 million or 44%.30Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our significant accounting policies.The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition;•Valuation of business combinations; and•Income taxes.Revenue RecognitionOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. We have concluded that our EDA software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation. Where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our obligation to customers which is to provide an ongoing right to use the most up to date and relevant software. As EDA customers operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment, satisfying the obligation requires providing critical updates to the existing software products, including ongoing iterative interaction with customers to make the software relevant to the customers’ ability to meet the time to go to market with advanced products. Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and•discount rates.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.31Table of ContentsOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedSee Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of OperationsWe adopted new revenue guidance, ASC 606, at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense. The comparative information for periods prior to the fiscal 2019 has not been restated. Additional comparative information is provided in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the adoption of ASC 606 and our pro-forma financial results under ASC 605 for fiscal 2019.Revenue Our revenues are generated from two business segments: the Semiconductor & System Design segment and the Software Integrity segment. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions. Further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows:Semiconductor & System Design SegmentThis segment is comprised of the following:•EDA software includes digital, custom and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) IC design software, verification products and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. EDA products and services are typically sold through TSL arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement and software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. The weighted-average term of the TSLs we entered into in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were all 2.7 years, respectively. Under ASC 606, we have concluded that the software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses represent inputs to a single, combined offering, and timely, relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under TSL contracts ratably over the term of the license. Under ASC 605, these arrangements were previously recognized ratably over the contract term.•IP & System Integration includes our DesignWare® IP portfolio and system-level products and services. Under ASC 606, these arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed IP and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over a time. Revenue allocated to the IP licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term. Royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our IP. Payments for IP contracts are generally received upon delivery of the IP. Revenue related to the customization of certain IP is recognized as “Professional Services.” Under ASC 605, we previously recognized revenues ratably for certain IP licensing and support arrangements. •In the case of arrangements involving the sale of Hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which 32Table of Contentsincludes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. The second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of delivery because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. We have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has title to the hardware, physical possession, and a present obligation to pay for the hardware. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term. The adoption of ASC 606 did not change the timing of revenue recognition for hardware products.•Revenue from Professional Service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. We have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. The adoption of ASC 606 did not change from ASC 605 the timing of revenue recognition for professional services.Software Integrity Segment•We sell Software Integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses, maintenance updates and technical support. Over the term of these arrangements, the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses, which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities. The licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide the functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation. We will recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement.Most of our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 (dollars in millions)Semiconductor & System Design Segment$3,026.1 $2,840.6 $2,551.1 $185.5 7% $289.5 11%Software Integrity Segment334.6 280.5 173.8 54.1 19% 106.7 61%Total$3,360.7 $3,121.1 $2,724.9 $239.6 8% $396.2 15%The overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including the timing and value of contract renewals, as well as payment terms for revenue recognized under ASC 605. For example, we experience variability in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of IP consulting projects, royalties, variability in IP products sales and hardware sales. As revenue from IP products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such IP products and hardware have resulted in increased variability of our total revenue.The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the continued business growth in all product categories, and higher revenue of $102.5 million recognized under new revenue standard ASC 606 compared with revenue recognized under old revenue standard ASC 605. The increase was partially offset by approximately $46.0 million of additional revenue due to one extra week in fiscal 2018. 33Table of ContentsThe increase in total revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to the continued overall growth of our business, mainly due to higher TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, an increase in professional services, additional revenue of approximately $46.0 million due to an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and contributions from acquired companies.For a discussion of revenue by geographic areas, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Time-Based Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 (dollars in millions) $2,198.0 $2,303.3 $2,021.8 $(105.3) (5)% $281.5 14%Percentage of total revenue65% 74% 74% The decrease in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the impact of lower revenue recognized under ASC 606 of $206.9 million offset by an increase in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue due to arrangements booked in prior periods, including contributions from acquired companies, and additional revenue due to an extra week in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.Upfront Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 (dollars in millions) $619.8 $357.7 $338.2 $262.1 73% $19.5 6%Percentage of total revenue18% 11% 12% Changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of IP products driven by higher demand from customers and higher IP revenue recognized upfront under ASC 606 of $235.4 million.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of IP products driven by higher demand from customers.Upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of IP products and hardware sales.

We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.Cost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility.35Table of ContentsCost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. We expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions, but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue.Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $21.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases from organic hiring, $11.3 million in consulting costs primarily related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, $10.1 million in IT and facility expenses, and $5.3 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $24.4 million in amortization of intangible assets and one additional week of expenses of approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2018.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $47.7 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, an increase of $11.3 million in costs related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, and an increase of $7.9 million in amortization of intangible assets, as well as one additional week of expenses of approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2018.Changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Operating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 (dollars in millions) $1,136.9 $1,084.8 $908.8 $52.1 5% $176.0 19%Percentage of total revenue34% 35% 33% The increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of $41.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including organic hiring and those from prior year acquisitions, $22.8 million in IT and facility expenses, and $5.5 million in consultants and contractor costs, partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $19.3 million in fiscal 2018.The increase in research and development expense for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $114.4 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, and one additional week of expenses of approximately $19.3 million in fiscal 2018.Changes in other research and development expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Sales and Marketing Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2019 2018 2017 2018 to 2019 2017 to 2018 (dollars in millions) $632.9 $623.0 $549.2 $9.9 2% $73.8 13%Percentage of total revenue19% 20% 20% The increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of $11.3 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases and $4.3 million in IT and facility expenses, partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $5.8 million in fiscal 2018.For fiscal 2019, commission expenses were $4.1 million lower compared to commission expenses under ASC 605.36Table of ContentsChanges in other sales and marketing expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase of $51.0 million in personnel costs as a result of headcount increases, an increase of $7.5 million due to timing of marketing events, and one additional week of expenses of approximately $5.8 million in fiscal 2018.

The decreases were partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in personnel-related costs.The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $21.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, an increase of $22.1 million in professional service costs primarily due to additional legal, accounting, and tax services related to various projects, an increase of $18.2 million in net litigation settlement costs primarily due to a $26.0 million litigation settlement recorded in fiscal 2018 compared with $7.6 million net litigation charges recorded in fiscal 2017, an increase of $11.0 million in facilities expenses, and one additional week of expenses of approximately $4.1 million in fiscal 2018. Changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Change in Fair Value of Deferred CompensationThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, and in-process research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years.

Total charges under the Plan are expected to be $56 million to $65 million and consist primarily of severance, termination, and retirement benefits under the 2019 Voluntary Retirement Program (VRP). Restructuring charges under the Plan are anticipated to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2020.

Beginning in fiscal 2019, our annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is 21%.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 2.4%, which included a tax benefit of $28.1 million related to the realizability of U.S. foreign tax credits related to the transfer of intangibles associated with the tax restructuring in fiscal 2018, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $34.5 million, a foreign derived intangible income deduction (FDII) of $26.6 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $40.5 million.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was (19.0%), which included a tax benefit of $172.0 million relating to the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $35.1 million, a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of $21.8 million tax benefit for fiscal 2017, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $31.0 million. These benefits were partially offset by tax expense of $63.1 million for a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings, $51.1 million due to re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $27.9 million. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 64.4%, which included income tax expense of $166.2 million relating to a repatriation of foreign earnings of $825 million, $30.5 million due to an increase in valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets, a settlement with the Korean National Tax Service for the audit of fiscal years 2012 to 2016 of $7.9 million, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $36.4 million. These expenses were partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $38.1 million, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $25.5 million, and a settlement with the Taiwanese tax authorities for fiscal 2014 of $10.9 million. The integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among company-controlled entities. These intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a company-controlled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition. The Tax Act required us to pay a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a tax expense of $63.1 million. Based on subsequent judicial rulings in fiscal 2019 (including Altera Corp. et al. v. Commissioner and the Hungarian Administrative Court ruling, we recorded a tax benefit of $17.9 million related to the one-time transition tax. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements or further discussion.We continue to obtain, analyze and interpret additional guidance issued related to the Tax Act. The applicability and impact of the following new tax provisions are dependent in part on forthcoming IRS guidance. 39Table of Contents•A tax on global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), which is determined annually based on our aggregate foreign subsidiaries' income in excess of certain qualified business asset investment return. In fiscal 2019, the Company adopted an accounting policy to account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax. •A base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which functions as a minimum tax that partially disallows deductions for certain related party transactions and certain tax credits.•A special tax deduction for FDII, which, in general, allows a deduction of certain intangible income earned in the U.S. and derived from foreign sources.The Tax Act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.In July 2017, the Hungarian Tax Authority (the HTA) issued a final assessment against our Hungarian subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. The HTA has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. We paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. On April 30, 2019, the Hungarian Administrative Court ruled against Synopsys Hungary. We filed an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court on July 5, 2019.See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes, the impacts related to the Tax Act, and the Hungarian audit.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. As of October 31, 2019, we held an aggregate of $191.6 million in cash and cash equivalents in the United States and an aggregate of $537.0 million in our foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Tax Act, if we decide to repatriate the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for use in the U.S. in the future, the earnings made after December 31, 2017 would not be subject to further U.S. tax. In addition, we have provided foreign deferred taxes on our undistributed earnings of $6.3 million in fiscal 2019, which is sufficient to address the incremental tax that would be due on future foreign earnings. The following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow, and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2019.Cash and Cash Equivalents Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2019 2018 (dollars in millions)Cash and cash equivalents$728.6 $723.1 $5.5 1%Cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to cash from our operations and net proceeds from our credit facilities.

Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income and higher cash collections, partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendors.Fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher vendor disbursements, higher income taxes payment, higher accounts receivable due to timing of customer billings, and higher inventory. Disbursements in fiscal 2018 included certain one-time payments of $163.3 million for income taxes and $65.0 million for a litigation settlement. Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesFiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2018 of $616.0 million.Fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions of $393.4 million and lower proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, of $128.1 million.Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing ActivitiesFiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Cash used in financing activities was higher primarily due to higher debt repayments of $228.8 million and lower proceeds from credit facilities drawdowns of $427.7 million.Fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Cash provided by financing activities was higher primarily due to higher proceeds of $300.6 million from drawdowns of our credit facilities and lower debt repayment of $85.3 million.Accounts Receivable, net Year Ended October 31, 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Accounts receivable, net$553.9 $554.2 $(0.3) — %Changes in our accounts receivable balance are primarily driven by the timing of customer billing and collection activities.Working Capital Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets:41Table of Contents Year Ended October 31, 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets$1,738.9 $1,543.8 $195.1 13 %Current liabilities1,752.5 2,102.4 (349.9) (17)%Working capital (deficit)$(13.6) $(558.6) $545.0 (98)%Increases in our working capital were primarily due to a decrease in short-term debt of $326.2 million, an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $222.5 million, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $71.9 million, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $5.5 million.Other Commitments — Credit and Term Loan FacilitiesIn July 2018, we entered into a 220.0 million RMB (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support our facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the Chinese Central Bank rate plus 10% of such rate. As of October 31, 2019, we had $17.9 million outstanding under the agreement. On November 28, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders (the Credit Agreement) providing for (i) a $650.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan). The Credit Agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated May 19, 2015, in order to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $500.0 million to $650.0 million, provide a new $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility, and extend the termination date of the revolving credit facility from May 19, 2020 to November 28, 2021. Subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the Credit Agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of October 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.As of October 31, 2019, we had $119.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan, of which $102.2 million was classified as long-term liabilities. Outstanding principal payments under the Term Loan are due as follows:Fiscal year(in thousands)2020$17,813202127,187202275,000Total$120,000As of October 31, 2018, we had $133.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term loan, of which $120.0 million was classified as long-term liabilities. The total outstanding balance under the Revolver as of October 31, 2018 was $330.0 million, which was included in short-term liabilities.There was no outstanding balance under the Revolver as of October 31, 2019. We expect our borrowings under the Revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2019, borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR +1.000%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.Subsequent to fiscal year 2019, we drew down $160.0 million under the Revolver. The total outstanding balance of the Revolver as of December 20, 2019 is $160.0 million, net of repayments.OtherAs of October 31, 2019, our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. We proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average 42Table of Contentscredit rating exceeding AA. The majority of our investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. See Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our Revolver will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.Contractual ObligationsContractual obligations as of October 31, 2019 are as follows: Total Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021/ Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023/ Fiscal 2024 Thereafter Other (in thousands) Lease Obligations: Operating Leases(1)$622,599 $79,286 $149,180 $102,639 $291,494 $—Purchase Obligations(2)383,339 290,502 87,680 5,157 — —Term Loan(3)120,000 17,813 102,187 — — —Other Long-Term Obligations(4)1,725 862 863 — — —Long term accrued income taxes(5)29,911 — — — — 29,911Total$1,157,574 $388,463 $339,910 $107,796 $291,494 $29,911(1)See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2019. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.(3)These commitments relate to the principal of the Term Loan and a credit facility as discussed in Other Commitments above.(4)These other obligations include fees associated with our credit facility. (5)Long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2019. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2019 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2019, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of these investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 43Table of ContentsOur cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of October 31, 2019 are as follows: Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Total Fair Value (in thousands)Cash & Cash equivalent (variable rate)$598,027 $598,027 $598,027Approx. average interest rate1.03% Short-term debt (variable rate): Revolver$— $— $—Average interest rate$— Term Loan$17,813 $27,187 $75,000 $— $120,000 $120,000Average interest rateLIBOR +1.125% Credit Facility in China$17,905 $17,905 $17,905Average interest rateChinese Central Bank rate + 10% of such rate Foreign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months. See Note 2 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2019, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $10.4 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $10.4 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $10.4 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.Net unrealized loss of approximately $4.5 million and $23.9 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 44Table of ContentsInformation about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2019 was as follows: Gross NotionalAmount inU.S. Dollars AverageContractRate (in thousands) Forward Contract Values: Japanese yen$266,383 106.829Indian rupee118,635 74.243Euro104,142 1.148Hungarian forint88,164 294.994Canadian dollar49,633 1.318Taiwanese dollar48,831 30.291Chinese renminbi39,606 7.040Korean won37,039 1,176.930British pound sterling27,395 1.284Armenian dram10,784 471.530Israel shekel9,840 3.524Singapore dollar8,950 1.370Swiss franc8,039 0.971 $817,441 Equity Risk.

883241,SNPS,SYNOPSYS INC,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following overview of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7, the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business SummarySynopsys, Inc. provides products and services used across the entire Silicon to Software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to product teams developing advanced electronic systems to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. We also offer semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers 32Table of Contentsdevelop advanced chips and electronic systems. These products and services are part of our Semiconductor & System Design segment.We are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security, quality and compliance of software in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials. These tools and services are part of our Software Integrity segment.Our EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets, and our customers' spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. Our Software Integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code - while it is being written - for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance. Our Software Integrity customers are software developers across many industries, including, but also well beyond, the semiconductor and systems industries. Our Software Integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.We have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty. We achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, and because we recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on our revenue recognition policy. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way. Our growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, driving growth in the software security and quality market, and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market. In addition, due to our adoption of Accounting Standard Codification 606 (ASC 606), ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"", in the beginning of fiscal 2019, the way in which we are required to account for certain types of arrangements has increased the variability in our total revenue from period to period. Nevertheless, the accounting impact has not affected the cash generated from our business. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.COVID-19 PandemicWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the physical working environment of the substantial majority of our workforce to working from home, it has otherwise caused only minor disruptions to our business operations with a limited impact on our operating results thus far. Given the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the global economy, our historical results may not be an indication of future performance.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, its overall negative impact on the global economy generally and the semiconductor and electronics industries specifically, and continued responses by governments and businesses to COVID-19. We have not identified trends that we expect will materially impact our future operating results at this time. As we recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, any potential impact related to COVID-19 may be delayed. We have not observed any changes in the design activity of customers, but we experienced a slowdown in customer commitments in our Software Integrity segment. We have not received any significant requests from our customers to either delay payments or modify arrangements due to COVID-19. However, this situation could change in future periods and the extent that these requests may impact our business is uncertain. We have also experienced minor disruptions in our hardware supply chain, which we have been able to address with minimal impact to our business operations to date.We will continue to consider the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations. Although no material impairment or other effects have been identified to date related to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. That uncertainty affects 33Table of Contentsmanagement’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions as additional events and information become known.See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition.Business SegmentsSemiconductor & System Design. This segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services, and semiconductor IP portfolio, which encompasses products and services that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. EDA includes digital, custom and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) IC design software, verification products, and manufacturing software products. Designers use these products to automate the highly complex IC design process and to reduce defects that could lead to expensive design or manufacturing re-spins or suboptimal end products. For IP, we are a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven IP solutions for system-on-chips (SoCs). This includes IP that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, internet of things, and cloud computing markets, enabling designers to quickly develop SoCs in these areas.Software Integrity. This segment includes a broad portfolio of products and services such as leading quality testing technologies, automated analysis, and consulting experts. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we launched the Polaris Software Integrity Platform™, an integrated cloud-based solution that unites key elements to provide an even more valuable way for developers to better develop personalized approaches for open source license compliance and detect and remediate known security vulnerabilities and quality defects early in the development process, thereby minimizing risk and maximizing productivity.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2018 was a 53-week year and ended on November 3, 2018. Fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 52-week years ending on October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, respectively. Fiscal 2021 will be a 52-week year.For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Fiscal 2020 Financial Performance SummaryIn fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, our financial performance reflects the following:•Revenues were $3.7 billion, an increase of $324.6 million or 10%, primarily due to our continued organic growth;•Total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $3.1 billion, an increase of $224.8 million or 8%, primarily due to increases in employee-related costs of $193.4 million, resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs of $11.1 million; •Operating income of $620.1 million, an increase of $99.9 million or 19%.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our significant accounting policies.The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition;34Table of Contents•Valuation of business combinations; and•Income taxes.Revenue RecognitionOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether services and products are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. We have concluded that our EDA software licenses in Time-based Subscription License (TSL) contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation. Where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our obligation to customers which is to provide an ongoing right to use the most up to date and relevant software. As EDA customers operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment, satisfying the obligation requires providing critical updates to the existing software products, including ongoing iterative interaction with customers to make the software relevant to the customers’ ability to meet the time to go to market with advanced products. Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and•discount rates.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.35Table of ContentsEffect of New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedSee Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of OperationsWe adopted new revenue guidance, ASC 606, at the beginning of fiscal 2019 under the modified retrospective method which has limited the comparability of prior year results in revenue and commission expense. The comparative information for periods prior to fiscal 2019 has not been restated.Revenue Our revenues are generated from two business segments: the Semiconductor & System Design segment and the Software Integrity segment. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions. Further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows:Semiconductor & System Design SegmentThis segment is comprised of the following:•EDA software includes digital, custom and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) IC design software, verification products and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. EDA products and services are typically sold through TSL arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement and software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. The weighted-average term of the TSLs we entered into in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were approximately three years, respectively. Under ASC 606, we have concluded that the software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses represent inputs to a single, combined offering, and timely, relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under TSL contracts ratably over the term of the license. •IP & System Integration includes our DesignWare® IP portfolio and system-level products and services. Under ASC 606, these arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed IP and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over time. Revenue allocated to the IP licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term. Royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our IP. Payments for IP contracts are generally received upon delivery of the IP. Revenue related to the customization of certain IP is recognized as “Professional Services.” •In the case of arrangements involving the sale of Hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. The second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of shipment because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. We have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and an obligation to pay for the hardware. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term. •Revenue from Professional Service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. We have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.36Table of ContentsSoftware Integrity Segment•We sell Software Integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses, maintenance updates and technical support. Over the term of these arrangements, the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses, which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities. The licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement.Most of our customer arrangements involve hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions)Semiconductor & System Design Segment$3,327.2 $3,026.1 $2,840.6 $301.1 10% $185.5 7%Software Integrity Segment358.1 334.6 280.5 23.5 7% 54.1 19%Total$3,685.3 $3,360.7 $3,121.1 $324.6 10% $239.6 8%The overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience fluctuations in our revenue due to factors such as the timing of IP product sales, consulting projects, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) drawdowns, royalties, and hardware sales. As revenue from IP products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such IP products and hardware have resulted in increased variability of our total revenue.The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to the continued organic growth of the business in time-based and upfront IP license products, and higher maintenance and service revenue. The increase in total revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the continued business growth in all product categories, and higher revenue of $102.5 million recognized under new revenue standard ASC 606 compared with revenue recognized under old revenue standard ASC 605. The increase was partially offset by approximately $46.0 million of additional revenue due to one extra week in fiscal 2018. For a discussion of revenue by geographic areas, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Time-Based Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions) $2,365.2 $2,198.0 $2,303.3 $167.2 8% $(105.3) (5)%Percentage of total revenue64% 65% 74% The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.37Table of ContentsThe decrease in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the impact of lower revenue recognized under ASC 606 of $206.9 million offset by an increase in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.Upfront Products Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions) $735.6 $619.8 $357.7 $115.8 19% $262.1 73%Percentage of total revenue20% 18% 11% Changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in the extent and timing of customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of IP products driven by higher demand from customers.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of IP products driven by higher demand from customers and higher IP revenue recognized upfront under ASC 606 of $235.4 million.Upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of IP products and hardware sales. Such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments due to customer requirements.Maintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions)Maintenance revenue$177.4 $179.0 $100.4 $(1.6) (1)% $78.6 78%Professional service and other revenue407.1 363.9 359.6 43.2 12 % 4.3 1%Total$584.5 $542.9 $460.0 $41.6 8 % $82.9 18%Percentage of total revenue16% 17% 15% Maintenance revenue for fiscal 2020 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the volume and type of arrangements that include maintenance.The increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue under ASC 606 of $74.0 million and an increase in the volume of arrangements that include maintenance.The increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of IP consulting projects and the timing of IP consulting projects.The increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the timing of IP consulting projects.

The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our overall growth, and fixed charges including information technology (IT) and facilities. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, or fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs.Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions)Cost of products revenue$487.3 $459.1 $448.4 $28.2 6 % $10.7 2 %Cost of maintenance and service revenue254.9 234.2 203.5 20.7 9 % 30.7 15 %Amortization of intangible assets52.5 59.6 84.0 (7.1) (12)% (24.4) (29)%Total$794.7 $752.9 $735.9 $41.8 6 % $17.0 2 %Percentage of total revenue22% 22% 24% We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.Cost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, hardware related direct costs, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that had reached technological feasibility.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and costs to deliver our consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. We expect our cost of maintenance and service revenue to increase in future periods because of recent acquisitions, but we do not expect the impact to be material to our total cost of revenue.Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete related to acquisitions and certain contract rights related to acquisitions.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increases of $25.6 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases from organic hiring and acquisitions, $16.1 39Table of Contentsmillion in consulting costs primarily related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, $5.1 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses, and $2.8 million in hardware related direct costs, partially offset by a decrease of $7.1 million in amortization of intangible assets.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase of $21.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases from organic hiring, $11.3 million in consulting costs primarily related to servicing IP consulting arrangements, $10.1 million in IT and facility expenses, and $5.3 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $24.4 million in amortization of intangible assets and one additional week of expenses of approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2018.Changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Operating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions) $1,279.0 $1,136.9 $1,084.8 $142.1 12% $52.1 5%Percentage of total revenue35% 34% 35% The increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to increases of $124.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including those from acquisitions, $14.8 million in facility expenses, and $6.6 million in consultants and contractor costs, partially offset by lower deferred compensation expenses of $4.5 million.The increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of $41.5 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases, including organic hiring and those from prior year acquisitions, $22.8 million in IT and facility expenses, and $5.5 million in consultants and contractor costs, partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $19.3 million in fiscal 2018.Changes in other research and development expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Sales and Marketing Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions) $632.0 $632.9 $623.0 $(0.9) — % $9.9 2%Percentage of total revenue17% 19% 20% Sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a decrease of $19.5 million that included reduced travel and marketing expenses as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by an increase in personnel-related costs of $19.1 million.The increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increases of $11.3 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases and $4.3 million in IT and facility expenses, partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $5.8 million in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2019, commission expenses were $4.1 million lower compared to commission expenses for fiscal 2018 which was accounted for under ASC 605.Changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material. 40Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions) $284.5 $229.2 $262.6 $55.3 24% $(33.4) (13)%Percentage of total revenue8% 7% 8% The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase of $24.2 million in personnel-related expenses, a legal settlement of $18.3 million in our favor in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and an increase of $13.1 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in professional service costs.The decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a $26.0 million litigation settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, a legal settlement of $18.3 million in our favor in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and an additional week of expenses of approximately $4.1 million in fiscal 2018. The decreases were partially offset by a $7.1 million increase in personnel-related costs.Changes in other general and administrative expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Change in Fair Value of Deferred CompensationThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no impact to our net income from the fair value changes in our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, and in-process research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years.

Restructuring ChargesIn the second quarter of fiscal 2019, our management approved, committed and initiated a restructuring plan (the Plan) as part of a business reorganization. Total charges under the Plan consisted primarily of severance, termination, and retirement benefits under the 2019 Voluntary Retirement Program (VRP).41Table of ContentsThe following is a summary of our restructuring activities:Fiscal YearBalance at Beginning of Period Costs Incurred Cash Payments Balance at End of Period (in millions)2020$22.6 $36.1 $(57.4) $1.32019$8.1 $47.2 $(32.7) $22.62018$17.5 $12.7 $(22.1) $8.1See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions)Interest income$3.6 $6.9 $5.3 $(3.3) (48)% $1.6 30 %Interest expense(5.1) (11.7) (15.6) 6.6 (56)% 3.9 (25)%Gain (loss) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan21.5 27.8 4.6 (6.3) (23)% 23.2 504 %Foreign currency exchange gain (loss)5.5 3.6 3.6 1.9 53 % — — %Other, net(7.5) (1.3) 5.4 (6.2) 477 % (6.7) (124)%Total$18.0 $25.3 $3.3 $(7.3) (29)% $22.0 667 %The net decrease in other income (expense) for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to changes in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets, partially offset by lower interest expenses due to a lower debt balance.The net increase in other income (expense) in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was also primarily due to changes in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.Segment Operating ResultsWe do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments. These unallocated expenses consist primarily of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, litigation and acquisition-related costs.

Beginning in fiscal 2019, our annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is 21%.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was (4.0%), which included a tax benefit of $39.2 million of U.S. federal research tax credit, a foreign derived intangible income (FDII) deduction of $24.3 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $72.3 million.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 2.4%, which included a tax benefit of $28.1 million related to the realizability of U.S. foreign tax credits related to the transfer of intangibles associated with the tax restructuring in fiscal 2018, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $34.5 million, a FDII deduction of $26.6 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $40.5 million.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was (19.0%), which included a tax benefit of $172.0 million relating to the restructuring of our foreign intellectual property rights, a U.S. federal research tax credit of $35.1 million, a tax benefit of $28.1 million arising from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in fiscal 2017, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $31.0 million. These benefits were partially offset by tax expense of $63.1 million for a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings, $51.1 million due to re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act, and tax expense related to the integration of acquired technologies of $27.9 million. The integration of acquired technologies represents the income tax effect resulting from the transfer of certain intangible assets among company-controlled entities. These intangible assets generally result from the acquisition of technology by a company-controlled entity as part of a business or asset acquisition. The Tax Act required us to pay a one-time transition tax on previously untaxed earnings represented by foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a tax expense of $63.1 million. Based on subsequent judicial rulings in fiscal 2019 (including Altera Corp. et al. v. Commissioner and the Hungarian Administrative Court ruling), we recorded a tax benefit of $17.9 million related to the one-time transition tax. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.The Tax Act includes certain new tax provisions listed below which apply to us beginning in fiscal 2019. •A tax on global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), which is determined annually based on our aggregate foreign subsidiaries' income in excess of certain qualified business asset investment return. In fiscal 2019, we adopted an accounting policy to account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax. •A base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which functions as a minimum tax that partially disallows deductions for certain related party transactions and certain tax credits.•A special tax deduction for FDII, which, in general, allows a deduction of certain intangible income earned in the U.S. and derived from foreign sources.43Table of ContentsThe Tax Act also provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.In July 2017, the Hungarian Tax Authority (the HTA) issued a final assessment against our Hungarian subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. The HTA applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. We paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. On April 30, 2019, the Hungarian Administrative Court ruled against Synopsys Hungary. We filed an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court on July 5, 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of the Court's decision, we recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of $17.4 million, which is net of estimated U.S. foreign tax credits for the tax assessments. The Hungarian Supreme Court heard our appeal on November 12, 2020 and issued a ruling from the bench to remand the case to the Hungarian Administrative Court for further proceedings. We expect to receive the Hungarian Supreme Court’s written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes, the impacts related to the Tax Act, and the Hungarian audit.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. We have considered the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources. Although we have not observed any material effects on our liquidity, collections from customers or other working capital requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic to date, there is substantial uncertainty that could result in greater variability as additional events and information become known. We believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, share repurchases, acquisitions, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. We are continuously evaluating the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects and taking steps to mitigate known risks, including potential constraints on our liquidity and capital resources as a result of customers’ reduced expenditures or disruptions to our supply chain. In light of that ongoing assessment, we may choose to temporarily defer certain expenditures due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.As of October 31, 2020, we held an aggregate of $590.0 million in cash and cash equivalents in the United States and an aggregate of $645.7 million in our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. The following sections discuss changes in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flow, and other commitments of our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2020.Cash and Cash Equivalents Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2020 2019 (dollars in millions)Cash and cash equivalents$1,235.7 $728.6 $507.1 70%Cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to cash from our operations and net proceeds from our credit facilities. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was partially offset by stock repurchases, repayment of debt, cash used for acquisition, and purchases of property and equipment.44Table of ContentsCash Flows Year Ended October 31, $ Change $ Change 2020 2019 2018 2019 to 2020 2018 to 2019 (dollars in millions)Cash provided by operating activities$991.3 $800.5 $424.4 $190.8 $376.1Cash used in investing activities$(360.4) $(235.9) $(743.5) $(124.5) $507.6Cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(140.6) $(561.9) $5.1 $421.3 $(567.0)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.Fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income, higher cash collections and lower disbursements in operations, including timing of vendor payments and other employee related expenses. Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income and higher cash collections, partially offset by higher disbursements for operations, including vendor payments.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions of $164.4 million.Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2018 of $616.0 million.Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing ActivitiesFiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower debt repayments of $235.2 million and higher proceeds of $83.6 million from credit facilities drawdowns.Fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Cash used in financing activities was higher primarily due to higher debt repayments of $228.8 million and lower proceeds from credit facilities drawdowns of $427.7 million.Accounts Receivable, net Year Ended October 31, 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Accounts receivable, net$780.7 $553.9 $226.8 41%Changes in our accounts receivable balance are primarily driven by the timing and volume of customer billing and collection activities.Working Capital Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets:45Table of Contents Year Ended October 31, 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets$2,549.2 $1,738.9 $810.3 47 %Current liabilities2,139.9 1,752.5 387.4 22 %Working capital (deficit)$409.3 $(13.6) $422.9 (3,110)%Increases in our working capital were primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $507.1 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $226.8 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $175.8 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $117.2 million. We did not see a significant impact on our working capital during this period from the COVID-19 pandemic.Other Commitments — Credit and Term Loan FacilitiesAs of October 31, 2020, we had $102.1 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan, of which $75.0 million was classified as long-term liabilities. Outstanding principal payments under the Term Loan are due as follows:Fiscal year(in thousands)2021$27,187202275,000Total$102,187As of October 31, 2019, we had a $119.8 million outstanding balance, net of debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan, of which $102.2 million was classified as long-term liabilities.There was no outstanding balance under the Revolver as of October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2019. We expect our borrowings under the Revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.Our Term Loan and Revolver borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2020, borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR +1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR +1.000%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.In July 2018, we entered into a 12-year 220.0 million RMB (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support our facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5 year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%. As of October 31, 2020, we had $25.8 million outstanding under the agreement. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.OtherAs of October 31, 2020, our cash equivalents consisted of taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. We proactively manage our cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. The majority of our investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. See Notes 6 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit under our Revolver will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.46Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsContractual obligations as of October 31, 2020 are as follows: Total Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022/ Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024/ Fiscal 2025 Thereafter Other (in thousands) Lease Obligations: Operating Leases(1)$659,559 $87,592 $155,057 $125,958 $290,952 $—Purchase Obligations(2)420,585 273,101 147,484 — — —Term Loan(3)102,187 27,187 75,000 — — —Other Obligations(4)26,778 26,778 — — — —Long term accrued income taxes(5)25,178 — — — — 25,178Total$1,234,287 $414,658 $377,541 $125,958 $290,952 $25,178(1)See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2020. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.(3)These commitments relate to the principal of the Term Loan and a credit facility as discussed in Other Commitments above.(4)These other obligations include fees associated with our credit facility. (5)Long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2020. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2020 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits.The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of October 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2020, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and debt were at short-term variable or fixed interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of these investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 47Table of ContentsOur cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of October 31, 2020 are as follows: Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 and thereafter Total Fair Value (in thousands)Cash & Cash equivalents$1,097,122 $1,097,122 $1,097,122Approx. average interest rate0.13% Short-term debt (variable rate): Term Loan$27,187 $75,000 — — $102,187 $102,187Average interest rateLIBOR +1.125% Credit Facility in China$25,823 $25,823 $25,823Average interest rateLPR + 0.74% of such rate Foreign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months. See Note 2 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2020, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $7.6 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $7.6 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in positive cash flow of approximately $7.6 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.Net unrealized gain of approximately $3.4 million and net unrealized loss of $4.5 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 48Table of ContentsInformation about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2020 was as follows: Gross NotionalAmount inU.S. Dollars AverageContractRate (in thousands) Forward Contract Values: Japanese yen$472,000 104.706Indian rupee138,080 76.984Euro76,076 1.141Hungarian forint70,000 308.939Canadian dollar45,658 1.339Chinese renminbi43,130 6.725Taiwanese dollar38,735 28.751British pound sterling21,826 1.262Korean won21,547 1,183.202Armenian dram21,243 479.960Israel shekel20,116 3.369Singapore dollar8,277 1.359Swiss franc4,545 0.909 $981,233 Equity Risk. We had approximately $13.2 million and $11.0 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The investments that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted using the measurement alternative when the fair value of the investment is not readily determinable. Securities accounted for as equity method investments are recorded at cost plus the proportional share of the issuers’ income or loss, which is recorded in the other income (expense), net. Investments are written down to the fair value when an event or circumstance which impacts the fair value of these investments indicates that the investments are impaired and the fair value of the investments is less than the carrying value. None of our investments are held for speculation purposes.49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:30:05.605287
883241,SNPS,SYNOPSYS INC,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following overview of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7, the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business SummarySynopsys, Inc. provides products and services used across the entire Silicon to Software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to product teams developing advanced electronic systems to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. We also offer semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide 32Table of Contentssoftware and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. These products and services are part of our Semiconductor & System Design segment.We are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security, quality and compliance of software in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials. These tools and services are part of our Software Integrity segment.Our EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets, and our customers' spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. Our Software Integrity business delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code - while it is being written - for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance. Our Software Integrity customers are software developers across many industries, including, but also well beyond, the semiconductor and systems industries. Our Software Integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.We have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty. We achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, and because we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on our revenue recognition policy. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way. Our growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, driving growth in the software security and quality market, and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market. Our revenue growth from period to period is expected to vary based on the mix of our time based and upfront products. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.COVID-19 PandemicWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the physical working environment of the substantial majority of our workforce to working from home, it has otherwise caused only minor disruptions to our business operations with a limited impact on our operating results thus far. Given the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the global economy, our historical results may not be an indication of future performance.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, its overall negative impact on the global economy generally and the semiconductor and electronics industries specifically, and continued responses by governments and businesses to COVID-19. We have not identified trends that we expect will materially impact our future operating results at this time. As we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, any potential impact related to COVID-19 may be delayed. We have not observed any changes in the design activity of customers, but we experienced a slowdown in customer commitments in our Software Integrity segment. We have not received any significant requests from our customers to either delay payments or modify arrangements due to COVID-19. However, this situation could change in future periods and the extent that these requests may impact our business is uncertain. We have also experienced minor disruptions in our hardware supply chain, which we have been able to address with minimal impact to our business operations to date.We will continue to consider the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations. Although no material impairment or other effects have been identified to date related to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. That uncertainty affects 33Table of Contentsmanagement’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions as additional events and information become known.See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition.Business SegmentsSemiconductor & System Design. This segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services, and semiconductor IP portfolio, which encompasses products and services that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. EDA includes digital, custom and field programmable gate array (FPGA) IC design software, verification products, and manufacturing software products. Designers use these products to automate the highly complex IC design process and to reduce defects that could lead to expensive design or manufacturing re-spins or suboptimal end products. For IP, we are a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven IP solutions for system-on-chips (SoCs). This includes IP that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, internet of things, and cloud computing markets, enabling designers to quickly develop SoCs in these areas.Software Integrity. This segment includes a broad portfolio of products and services to intelligently address software risks across the customer’s portfolio and at all stages of the application lifecycle. The testing tools, services, and programs enable our customers to manage open source license compliance and detect, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities and defects across their entire software development lifecycle. Our offerings include security and quality testing products, managed services, programs and professional services, and training.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 52-week years ending on October 30, 2021, October 31, 2020 and November 2, 2019, respectively. Fiscal 2022 will be a 52-week year.For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial results under Results of Operations below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our significant accounting policies.The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition;•Valuation of business combinations; and•Income taxes.34Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Arrangements with customers can involve multiple products and various license rights. Customers can negotiate for a broad portfolio of solutions, and favorable terms along with future purchase options to manage their overall costs. Analysis of the terms and conditions in these contracts and their effect on revenue recognition may require significant judgment. We have concluded that our EDA software licenses in Time-based Subscription License (TSL) contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation. Where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. For our IP licensing arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and support services are distinct from each other, and therefore treated as separate performance obligations. Revenues from IP licenses are recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control of the IP license, and support services are recognized over the support period as a stand ready obligation to the customer. Valuation of Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•estimated obsolescence rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and•discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value, which are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Income TaxesWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.35Table of ContentsChanges from Prior Periodic Reports In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have revised our disclosures to comply with SEC Release No. 33-10825, “Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105.” In addition, we have adopted the changes in the disclosure standards included in SEC Release No. 33-10890, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, Supplementary Financial Information.” Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105 The SEC issued Release No. 33-10825, “Modernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105,” effective for annual periods beginning subsequent to November 2020. This release was adopted to simplify the description of business, legal proceedings, and risk factor disclosures that registrants are required to make pursuant to Regulation S-K. Specifically, this release requires registrants to provide disclosures relating to their human capital resources and to restructure their risk factor disclosures. Additionally, the release increases the threshold for disclosure of environmental proceedings to which the government is a party. Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information The SEC issued Release No. 33-10890 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, Supplementary Financial Information” which became fully effective on August 9, 2021. This release was adopted to simplify and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, the SEC eliminated the requirement for selected financial data, only requiring quarterly disclosure when there are retrospective changes affecting comprehensive income, and amending the matters required to be presented under Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) to, among other things, eliminate the requirement to include the contractual obligations table. With our adoption of this release, we have eliminated from this document the items discussed above that are no longer required. Information on our contractual obligations is still disclosed in narrative form within the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Results of OperationsThe discussion of our consolidated results of operations include year-over-year comparisons of fiscal 2021 changes compared to fiscal 2020. For a discussion of the fiscal 2020 changes compared to fiscal 2019, see the discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, filed on December 15, 2020.Fiscal 2021 Financial Performance SummaryResults of operations for fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020, reflect the following:•Revenues were $4,204.2 million, an increase of $518.9 million or 14%, primarily due to higher revenue resulting from growth across all products and geographies.•Total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $3,469.4 million, an increase of $404.3 million or 13%, primarily due to increases of $342.2 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions.•Operating income was $734.8 million, an increase of $114.6 million or 18%, as revenue growth exceeded the growth of costs and expenses.Revenue Our revenues are generated from two business segments: the Semiconductor & System Design segment and the Software Integrity segment. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions. Further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows:Semiconductor & System Design SegmentThis segment is comprised of the following:•EDA software includes digital, custom and FPGA IC design software, verification products and 36Table of Contentsobligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. EDA products and services are typically sold through TSL arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement and software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. The duration of our TSL contracts is generally 3 years, though it may vary for specific arrangements. We have concluded that the software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses and support represent inputs to a single, combined offering, and timely, relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under TSL contracts ratably over the term of the license. •IP & System Integration includes our DesignWare® IP portfolio and system-level products and services. These arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed IP and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over time. Revenue allocated to the IP licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term. Royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our IP. Payments for IP contracts are generally received upon delivery of the IP. Revenue related to the customization of certain IP is recognized as “Professional Services.” •In the case of arrangements involving the sale of hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. The second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of shipment because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. We have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and an obligation to pay for the hardware. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term. •Revenue from Professional Service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. We have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.Software Integrity Segment•We sell Software Integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses, maintenance updates and technical support. Over the term of these arrangements, the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses, which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities. The licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement.Our customer arrangements can involve multiple products and various license rights, and our customers negotiate with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they may request a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.37Table of ContentsTotal RevenueYear Ended October 31,$ Change % Change 202120202020 to 2021(dollars in millions)Semiconductor & System Design Segment$3,810.4 $3,327.2 $483.2 15 %Software Integrity Segment393.8 358.1 35.7 10 %Total$4,204.2 $3,685.3 $518.9 14 %Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience fluctuations in our revenues due to factors such as the timing of IP product sales, consulting projects, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) drawdowns, royalties, and hardware sales. As revenues from IP products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such IP products and hardware could result in increased variability of our total revenues.For fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, revenues increased primarily due to the continued organic growth of our business in most product categories and regions as a result of increased investments by our customers in new, complex designs for their hardware and software products across a wide range of industries. For a discussion of revenue by geographic areas, see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Time-Based Products Revenue Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)Time-based products revenue$2,633.8 $2,365.2 $268.6 11 %Percentage of total revenue63 %64 %The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue and higher renewals from arrangements booked in prior periods.Upfront Products Revenue Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)Upfront products revenue$861.1 $735.6 $125.5 17 %Percentage of total revenue20 %20 %Changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in the extent and timing of customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of IP products and hardware products driven by higher demands from customers.Upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of IP products and hardware sales. Such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments or FSA drawdowns due to customer requirements.38Table of ContentsMaintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)Maintenance revenue$235.9 $177.4 $58.5 33 %Professional service and other revenue473.5 407.1 66.4 16 %Total$709.4 $584.5 $124.9 21 %Percentage of total revenue17 %16 %The increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of hardware and IP arrangements that include maintenance.The increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of IP consulting projects.Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)Cost of products revenue$542.1 $487.3 $54.8 11 %Cost of maintenance and service revenue271.2 254.9 16.3 6 %Amortization of intangible assets48.5 52.5 (4.0)(8)%Total$861.8 $794.7 $67.1 8 %Percentage of total revenue20 %22 %We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of products revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate group costs between cost of products revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on products and maintenance and service revenue reported.Cost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, hardware related direct costs, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized software development costs.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes costs to deliver our maintenance and consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates.Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of core/developed technology and certain contract rights intangible.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increases of $54.8 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases from hiring and acquisitions, $20.0 million in hardware related costs, and higher deferred compensation expenses of $4.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $5.3 million in depreciation and maintenance expense, a decrease of $4.0 million in servicing IP consulting arrangements expense and a reduction of $4.0 million in amortization of intangible assets as certain technology-related intangibles assets became fully amortized during 2021.Changes in other cost of revenue categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.39Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)$1,504.8 $1,279.0 $225.8 18 %Percentage of total revenue36 %35 %The increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher personnel-related costs of $176.0 million from headcount increases from hiring and acquisitions as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio, $9.7 million in consultant and contractor costs, $7.4 million in facility expenses, as well as higher deferred compensation expenses of $29.3 million.Changes in other research and development expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.Sales and Marketing Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)$712.5 $632.0 $80.5 13 %Percentage of total revenue17 %17 %The increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase of $71.8 million in personnel-related costs due to headcount increases from hiring and higher sales commissions as well as higher deferred compensation expenses of $11.0 million, partially offset by a decrease of $4.8 million in travel costs as a result of COVID-19 restrictions.Changes in other sales and marketing expense categories for the above-mentioned periods were not individually material.

These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no impact to our net income from the fair value changes in our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset.40Table of ContentsAmortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, and customer relationships related to acquisitions completed in prior years.

Restructuring ChargesIn the third quarter of fiscal 2021, our management approved, committed and initiated a restructuring plan (the 2021 Plan) as part of a business reorganization. Total charges under the 2021 Plan are expected to be in the range of $42 million to $53 million and consist primarily of severance, retirement benefits under the 2021 Voluntary Retirement Program (2021 VRP), and lease abandonment costs. Restructuring charges under the 2021 Plan are anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.The following is a summary of our restructuring liabilities:Fiscal YearBalance at Beginning of PeriodCosts IncurredCash PaymentsBalance at End of Period(in millions)2021$1.3 $33.4 $(20.5)$14.2 2020$22.6 $36.1 $(57.4)$1.3 2019$8.1 $47.2 $(32.7)$22.6 See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)Interest income$2.4 $3.6 $(1.2)(33)%Interest expense(3.4)(5.1)1.7 (33)%Gain (loss) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan71.6 21.5 50.1 233 %Foreign currency exchange gain (loss)5.3 5.5 (0.2)(4)%Other, net(5.2)(7.5)2.3 (31)%Total$70.7 $18.0 $52.7 293 %The increase in other income (expense) for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to increase in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.Segment Operating ResultsWe do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments. These unallocated expenses consist primarily of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, litigation and acquisition-related costs. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.41Table of ContentsSemiconductor & System Design Segment Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)Adjusted operating income$1,243.1 $990.8 $252.3 25 %Adjusted operating margin33 %30 %3 %10 %The increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.Software Integrity Segment Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)Adjusted operating income $38.3 $40.8 $(2.5)(6)%Adjusted operating margin10 %11 %(1)%(9)%The decrease in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 6.1%, which included a tax benefit of $45.5 million of U.S. federal research tax credit, a foreign derived intangible income (FDII) deduction of $31.2 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $94.0 million.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was (4.0%), which included a tax benefit of $39.2 million of U.S. federal research tax credit, a FDII deduction of $24.3 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $72.3 million.The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.In July 2017, the Hungarian Tax Authority (the HTA) issued a final assessment against our Hungarian subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. The HTA applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. We paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. On April 30, 2019, the Hungarian Administrative Court ruled against Synopsys Hungary. We filed an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court on July 5, 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, as a result of the Court's decision, we recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of $17.4 million, which is net of estimated U.S. foreign tax credits for the tax assessments. The Hungarian Supreme Court heard our appeal on November 12, 2020 and remanded the case to the Hungarian Administrative Court for further proceedings. We received the Hungarian Supreme Court's written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. On April 27, 2021, the Administrative Court reheard the case and again ruled against Synopsys Hungary. We received the written opinion from the Administrative Court on May 19, 2021. We filed an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court on July 19, 2021. The hearing for the appeal is scheduled for January 27, 2022.See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes, the impacts related to the Tax Act, and the Hungarian audit.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. 42Table of ContentsAs of October 31, 2021, we held $1,580.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our cash equivalents consisted primarily of taxable money market mutual funds, time deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Our short-term investments include U.S. government and municipal obligations, investment-grade available-for-sale debt and asset backed securities. We believe that the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. As of October 31, 2021, approximately $799.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and development efforts. We also may invest in or acquire complementary businesses, applications or technologies, or may further expand our board-authorized stock repurchase program, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional financing.Cash Flows Year Ended October 31,$ Change 202120202020 to 2021 (dollars in millions)Cash provided by operating activities$1,492.6 $991.3 $501.3 Cash used in investing activities$(549.0)$(360.4)$(188.6)Cash used in financing activities$(748.7)$(140.6)$(608.1)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.Fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher operating income and higher cash collections.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchase of short-term investments of $161.7 million and higher cash paid for acquisitions of $95.0 million, partially offset by lower purchases of property and equipment of $61.0 million. Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher stock repurchases of $546.0 million and higher income taxes paid for net share settlements of $56.7 million.Credit and Term Loan FacilitiesOn November 28, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders (as amended and restated, the Credit Agreement) providing for (i) a $650.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan). On January 22, 2021, the Credit Agreement was amended (Credit Agreement) to extend the termination date of the existing $650 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility from November 28, 2021 to January 22, 2024, which may be further extended at our option. Further, the Credit Agreement was also amended to provide an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to $150.0 million in the aggregate principal amount. 43Table of ContentsOur outstanding term loan borrowings under the previous credit agreement carried over under the Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2021, we had $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount in outstanding balance under the Term Loan. There was no outstanding balance under the Revolver as of October 31, 2021.In July 2018, we entered into a 12-year 220.0 million RMB (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support our facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5-year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%. As of October 31, 2021, we had $25.1 million outstanding under the agreement. The remaining outstanding balance of $75.0 million was repaid in full on November 26, 2021.Share Repurchase ProgramOur Board of Directors previously approved a stock repurchase program up to $500.0 million of our common stock, and approved a replenishment of the stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million in June 2021. During the fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $270.84 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $753.1 million. As of October 31, 2021, $110.0 million remained available for future share repurchases. In December 2021, our Board approved a stock repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. The pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions, our debt repayment obligations, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Contractual and Other ObligationsOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. LeasesWe have operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets. As of October 31, 2021, we had lease payment obligations, net of immaterial sublease income, of $588.3 million, with $80.4 million payable within 12 months.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of October 31, 2021, we had $301.7 million of purchase obligations, with $151.8 million payable within 12 months. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.Term Loan Refer to “Other Commitments – Credit and Term Loan Facilities” under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Long Term Accrued Income TaxesAs of October 31, 2021, we had $27.9 million of long-term accrued income taxes which represent uncertain tax benefits. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2021 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2021, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and debt were at short-term variable or fixed interest rates. As of October 31, 2021, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $147.9 million. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in 44Table of Contentsour investment policy. None of these investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. Our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of October 31, 2021 are as follows: Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 20222023202420252025 thereafterTotalFair Value (in thousands)Cash & Cash equivalents$1,416,810 $1,416,810 $1,416,810 Approx. average interest rate0.17 %Short-term debt (variable rate):Term Loan$75,000 $75,000 $75,000 Average interest rateLIBOR +1.125%Credit Facility in China$25,094 $25,094 $25,094 Average interest rateLPR + 0.74% of such rateForeign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 23 months. See Note 2 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2021, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $13.5 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $13.5 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in positive cash flow of approximately $13.5 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.Net unrealized gain of approximately $1.3 million and net unrealized loss of $3.4 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy.We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 45Table of ContentsInformation about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2021 was as follows:Gross NotionalAmount inU.S. DollarsAverageContractRate (in thousands) Forward Contract Values:Japanese yen$311,030 110.672 Indian rupee270,717 79.144 Euro135,099 1.182 Chinese renminbi97,860 6.470 Taiwanese dollar89,693 27.866 Canadian dollar68,780 1.265 Hungarian forint68,462 315.169 Korean won50,453 1,186.931 British pound sterling29,994 1.368 Israel shekel25,502 3.217 Armenian dram9,799 510.264 Singapore dollar9,503 1.361 Swiss franc9,260 0.923 $1,176,152 Equity Risk. We had approximately $17.6 million and $13.2 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The investments that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over are accounted for using the measurement alternative when the fair value of the investment is not readily determinable. Securities accounted for as equity method investments are recorded at cost plus the proportional share of the issuers’ income or loss, which is recorded in the other income (expense), net. Investments are written down to the fair value when an event or circumstance which impacts the fair value of these investments indicates that the investments are impaired and the fair value of the investments is less than the carrying value. None of our investments are held for speculation purposes.46Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:29:50.487664
883241,SNPS,SYNOPSYS INC,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following overview is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7, the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K, and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Business SummarySynopsys provides products and services used across the entire Silicon to Software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to product teams developing advanced electronic systems to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code. We are a global leader in electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. We also offer semiconductor intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than designing those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to validate the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. We also provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. These products and services are part of our Semiconductor & System Design segment.33Table of ContentsWe are also a leading provider of software tools and services that improve the security, quality and compliance of software in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, automotive, medicine, energy and industrials. These tools and services are part of our Software Integrity segment.Our EDA and IP customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help these companies overcome the challenges of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while also helping them reduce their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, our sales could be affected based on their research and development budgets, and our customers' spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. Our Software Integrity segment delivers products and services that enable software developers to test their code - while it is being written - for known security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as testing for open source security vulnerabilities and license compliance. Our Software Integrity customers are software developers across many industries, including, but also well beyond, the semiconductor and systems industries. Our Software Integrity products and services form a platform that helps our customers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.We have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty. We achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, and because we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our revenue recognition policy. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way. Our growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our EDA products, expanding and proliferating our IP offerings, driving growth in the software security and quality market, and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market. Our revenue growth from period to period is expected to vary based on the mix of our time based and upfront products. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.Recent DevelopmentsDevelopments in Export Control RegulationsOn October 7, 2022, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce published changes to U.S. export control regulations (U.S. Export Regulations), including new restrictions on Chinese entities' ability to obtain advanced computing chips, develop and maintain supercomputers, and manufacture advanced semiconductors. Further, on October 14, 2022, a new rule went into effect imposing U.S. export controls on additional technologies, including electronic computer-aided design software specially designed for the development of ICs with Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor structures. Based on our current understanding, we believe these regulations will not have a material impact on our business. We anticipate additional changes to U.S. Export Regulations in the future, but we cannot forecast the scope or timing of such changes. We will continue to monitor such developments, including potential additional trade restrictions, and other regulatory or policy changes by the U.S. and foreign governments. For more on risks related to government export and import restrictions such as the U.S. government’s Entity List and other U.S. Export Regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Industry Risks – We are subject to governmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets.”Impact of the Current Macroeconomic Environment and COVID-19Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including due to the effects of the recent rise in global inflation and interest rates, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical pressures, including the unknown impact of current and future U.S. and Chinese trade regulations, changes in China-Taiwan relations and the war in Ukraine, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, and associated global economic conditions have resulted in volatility in credit, equity and foreign currency markets. 34Table of ContentsThese uncertain macroeconomic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we experienced a minor impact from the current macroeconomic environment in our Software Integrity segment as customers applied elevated levels of scrutiny to purchasing decisions, which has, in some cases, caused some customers to elect shorter term contracts due to their own budget uncertainty. If these uncertain macroeconomic conditions persist, they may continue to have an adverse impact on certain aspects of our business.Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted worldwide economic activity and financial markets and significantly increased economic volatility and uncertainty. Despite this widespread volatility and uncertainty, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused only minor disruptions to our business operations with a limited impact on our operating results thus far. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors, including the duration of the pandemic and its overall negative impact on the global economy generally and the semiconductor and electronics industries specifically. We have not identified trends that we expect will materially impact our future operating results at this time and continue to consider the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations. While our time-based business model provides stability to our business, operating results and overall financial position, the broader implications of these macroeconomic events, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. Further, the negative impact of these events or disruptions may be deferred due to our business model. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion of the impact of global economic uncertainty and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition.Business SegmentsSemiconductor & System Design. This segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services, and semiconductor IP portfolio, which encompasses products and services that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. EDA includes digital, custom and field programmable gate array (FPGA) IC design software, verification products, and manufacturing software products. Designers use these products to automate the highly complex IC design process and to reduce defects that could lead to expensive design or manufacturing re-spins or suboptimal end products. For IP, we are a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven IP solutions for system-on-chips (SoCs). This includes IP that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, IoT, and cloud computing markets, enabling designers to quickly develop SoCs in these areas.Software Integrity. This segment includes a broad portfolio of products and services to intelligently address software risks across the customer’s portfolio and at all stages of the application lifecycle. The testing tools, services, and programs enable our customers to manage open source license compliance and detect, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities and defects across their entire software development lifecycle. Our offerings include security and quality testing products, managed services, programs and professional services, and training.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were 52-week years ending on October 29, 2022, October 30, 2021, and October 31, 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2023 will be a 52-week year.For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our significant accounting policies.The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:35Table of Contents•Revenue recognition; and•Business combinations.Revenue RecognitionOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Arrangements with customers can involve multiple products and various license rights. Customers can negotiate for a broad portfolio of solutions, and favorable terms along with future purchase options to manage their overall costs. Analysis of the terms and conditions in these contracts and their effect on revenue recognition may require significant judgment. We have concluded that our EDA software licenses in Technology Subscription License (TSL) contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation. Where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. For our IP licensing arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and support services are distinct from each other, and therefore treated as separate performance obligations. Revenues from IP licenses are recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control of the IP license, and support services are recognized over the support period as a stand ready obligation to the customer.We are required to estimate total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date with the exception of contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) which are recognized and measured on the acquisition date in accordance with our ""Revenue Recognition"" policy in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, as if we had originated the contracts. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimates for intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•estimated obsolescence rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and•discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value, which are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks.36Table of ContentsThe fair value of the definite-lived intangibles was determined using variations of the income approach.For acquired existing technology, the fair value was determined by applying the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach, which involves isolating the net earnings attributable to the asset being measured based on present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the asset over its remaining useful life. The economic useful life was determined based on historical technology obsolescence patterns and prospective technology developments. For acquisitions completed in fiscal 2022, we assumed technological obsolescence ranging from 6 to 10 years. The present value of operating cash flows from the existing technology was determined using discount rates ranging from approximately 10% to 30%.Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships with the acquired company’s customers. Their fair value was determined using the distributor method of the income approach, a variation of the multi-period excess earnings method. The distributor method relies upon market-based distributor data to estimate the excess profits associated with the asset over its remaining useful life. The economic useful life was determined based on historical customer turnover rates. Projected income from existing customer relationships considered customer retention rates ranging from 92.5% to 97.5%. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates ranging from approximately 10% to 15%.We believe that our estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of acquired intangible assets are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.Results of OperationsThe discussion of our consolidated results of operations includes year-over-year comparisons of fiscal 2022 changes compared to fiscal 2021. For a discussion of the fiscal 2021 changes compared to fiscal 2020, see the discussion in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, filed on December 13, 2021.Fiscal 2022 Financial Performance SummaryResults of operations for fiscal 2022, compared to fiscal 2021, reflected the following:•Revenues were $5.1 billion, an increase of $877.3 million or 21%, due to higher revenue resulting from growth across all products and geographies.•Total cost of revenue and operating expenses were $3.9 billion, an increase of $450.1 million or 13%, primarily due to increases of $379.2 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions.•Operating income was $1.2 billion, an increase of $427.2 million or 58%, as revenue growth exceeded the growth in costs and expenses.Revenue Our revenues are generated from two business segments: the Semiconductor & System Design segment and the Software Integrity segment. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions. Further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these two segments is summarized as follows:Semiconductor & System Design SegmentThis segment is comprised of the following:•EDA software includes digital, custom and FPGA IC design software, verification products and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. EDA products and services are typically sold through Technology Subscription License (TSL) arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement; software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. The duration of our TSL contracts is generally 3 years, though it may vary for specific arrangements. We have concluded that the software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses and support represent inputs to a single, combined offering, and timely, relevant software 37Table of Contentsupdates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under TSL contracts ratably over the term of the license. •IP & System Integration includes our DesignWare® IP portfolio and system-level products and services. These arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed IP and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over time. Revenue allocated to the IP licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term. Royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our IP. Payments for IP contracts are generally received upon delivery of the IP. Revenue related to the customization of certain IP is recognized as “Professional Services.” •In the case of arrangements involving the sale of hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. The second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of shipment because the customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. We have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and an obligation to pay for the hardware. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term. •Revenue from Professional Service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. We have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.Software Integrity Segment•We sell Software Integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses, maintenance updates and technical support. Over the term of these arrangements, the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses, which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities. The licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement.Our customer arrangements can involve multiple products and various license rights, and our customers negotiate with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they generally request a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total RevenueYear Ended October 31,$ Change % Change 202220212021 to 2022(dollars in millions)Semiconductor & System Design Segment$4,615.7 $3,810.4 $805.3 21 %Software Integrity Segment465.8 393.8 72.0 18 %Total$5,081.5 $4,204.2 $877.3 21 %Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience fluctuations in our revenues due to factors such as the timing of IP product sales, consulting projects, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) drawdowns, royalties, and hardware sales. As 38Table of Contentsrevenues from IP products sales and hardware sales are recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such IP products and hardware could result in increased variability of our total revenues.Contracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations as of October 31, 2022 were $7.1 billion. The amount and composition of unsatisfied performance obligations will fluctuate period to period. We do not believe the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations is indicative of future sales or revenue, or that such obligations at the end of any given period correlates with actual sales performance of a particular geography or particular products and services. For more information regarding our revenue as of October 31, 2022, including our contract balances as of such date, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.For fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, revenues increased due to the continued organic growth of our business in all product groups and geographies. For a discussion of revenue by geographic areas, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Time-Based Products Revenue Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)Time-based products revenue$2,993.8 $2,633.8 $360.0 14 %Percentage of total revenue59 %63 %The increase in time-based products revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in TSL license revenue and higher renewals from arrangements booked in prior periods.Upfront Products Revenue Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)Upfront products revenue$1,226.7 $861.1 $365.6 42 %Percentage of total revenue24 %20 %Changes in upfront products revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in the extent and timing of customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period.The increase in upfront products revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of IP products and hardware products driven by higher demand from customers.Upfront products revenue as a percentage of total revenue will likely fluctuate based on the timing of IP products and hardware sales. Such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments or FSA drawdowns due to customer requirements.Maintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)Maintenance revenue$293.3 $235.9 $57.4 24 %Professional service and other revenue567.7 473.5 94.2 20 %Total$861.0 $709.4 $151.6 21 %Percentage of total revenue17 %17 %The increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of hardware and IP arrangements that include maintenance.The increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of IP consulting projects.39Table of ContentsCost of Revenue Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)Cost of products revenue$653.8 $542.1 $111.7 21 %Cost of maintenance and service revenue343.0 271.2 71.8 26 %Amortization of intangible assets66.9 48.5 18.4 38 %Total$1,063.7 $861.8 $201.9 23 %Percentage of total revenue21 %20 %We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets.Cost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, hardware-related costs, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized software development costs.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes costs to deliver our maintenance and consulting services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates.Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, included in cost of revenue, includes the amortization of core/developed technology and certain contract rights intangible assets.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to $102.7 million in employee-related costs as a result of headcount increases from organic growth and acquisitions, $51.7 million in hardware-related costs, $18.4 million in amortization of technology-related intangible assets, $16.4 million in costs to fulfill IP consulting arrangements, and $12.7 million in facility costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $11.5 million in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.Operating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)$1,680.4 $1,504.8 $175.6 12 %Percentage of total revenue33 %36 %The increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to higher employee-related costs of $199.1 million as a result of headcount increases as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio, increases of $19.2 million in facility costs, and $15.5 million in consultant and contractor costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $86.5 million in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.Sales and Marketing Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)$779.8 $712.5 $67.3 9 %Percentage of total revenue15 %17 %The increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to increases of $64.1 million in employee-related costs due to headcount increases and higher sales commissions, $12.0 million in travel and marketing costs due to an increased number of in-person meetings and events, and $3.0 million in facility costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $25.5 million in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets. 40Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)$353.8 $323.0 $30.8 10 %Percentage of total revenue7 %8 %The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to increases of $30.8 million in legal, consulting and other professional fees, $18.6 million in maintenance and depreciation expenses, and $13.3 million in personnel-related costs due to headcount increases from hiring. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $16.9 million in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets and bad debt recoveries of $15.9 million.Change in Fair Value of Deferred CompensationThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no impact on our net income from the fair value changes in our deferred compensation plan obligation and related assets.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets included within operating expenses consists of the amortization of trademarks, trade names, and customer relationships related to acquisitions.

Restructuring ChargesIn the third quarter of fiscal 2021, our management approved, committed and initiated a restructuring plan (the 2021 Plan) as part of a business reorganization. Total charges under the 2021 Plan consisting primarily of severance, retirement benefits, and lease abandonment costs, were $45.5 million, of which $33.4 million was incurred in fiscal 2021 and $12.1 million was incurred in fiscal 2022. The 2021 Plan was substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.The following is a summary of our restructuring liabilities:Fiscal YearBalance at Beginning of PeriodCosts IncurredCash PaymentsBalance at End of Period(dollars in millions)2022$14.2 $12.1 $(26.3)$— 2021$1.3 $33.4 $(20.5)$14.2 2020$22.6 $36.1 $(57.4)$1.3 See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.41Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)Interest income$8.5 $2.4 $6.1 254 %Interest expense(1.7)(3.4)1.7 (50)%Gains (losses) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan(68.8)71.6 (140.4)(196)%Foreign currency exchange gains (losses)4.7 5.3 (0.6)(11)%Other, net10.8 (5.2)16.0 (308)%Total$(46.5)$70.7 $(117.2)(166)%The decrease in other income (expense) for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.Segment Operating ResultsWe do not allocate certain operating expenses managed at a consolidated level to our reportable segments. These unallocated expenses consist primarily of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, changes in the fair value of deferred compensation plan, restructuring, litigation and acquisition-related costs. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Semiconductor & System Design Segment Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)Adjusted operating income$1,628.1 $1,243.1 $385.0 31 %Adjusted operating margin35 %33 %2 %6 %The increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.Software Integrity Segment Year Ended October 31,$ Change% Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)Adjusted operating income $47.0 $38.3 $8.7 23 %Adjusted operating margin10 %10 %— %— %The increase in adjusted operating income for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 is 12.3%, which included a tax benefit of $61.5 million of U.S. federal research tax credit, a foreign derived intangible income (FDII) deduction of $38.9 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $88.8 million.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 6.1%, which included a tax benefit of $45.5 million of U.S. federal research tax credit, a FDII deduction of $31.2 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $94.0 million.The Tax Act provides an exemption from federal income taxes for distributions from foreign subsidiaries made after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time transition tax. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.42Table of ContentsIn 2017, the Hungarian Tax Authority (the HTA) assessed withholding taxes of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million, against our Hungary subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary). Synopsys Hungary contested the assessment with the Hungarian Administrative Court (Administrative Court). In 2019, as required under Hungarian law, Synopsys Hungary paid the assessment and recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of $17.4 million, which is net of estimated U.S. foreign tax credits. The Administrative Court found against Synopsys Hungary, and we appealed to the Hungarian Supreme Court. During 2021, the Hungarian Supreme Court heard our appeal and remanded the case to the Administrative Court for further proceedings. The Administrative Court once again ruled against Synopsys Hungary, and we filed another appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court. The Hungarian Supreme Court heard our appeal on January 27, 2022, vacated the lower court's decision and remanded the case back to the Administrative Court for further proceedings. Hearings with the Administrative Court were held on June 30, 2022 and September 22, 2022. In response to a request by the Administrative Court we filed an additional brief on November 23, 2022. We expect a hearing to be scheduled in early 2023.See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes, the impacts related to the Tax Act, and the Hungarian audit.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. As of October 31, 2022, we held $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We also held $2.3 million in restricted cash primarily associated with deposits for office leases. Our cash equivalents consisted primarily of taxable money market mutual funds, time deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Our short-term investments include U.S. government and municipal obligations, investment-grade available-for-sale debt and asset backed securities. We believe that the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents, invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. As of October 31, 2022, approximately $755.1 million of our cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and capital return program over at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and development efforts. We also may invest in or acquire businesses, applications or technologies, or may further expand our board-authorized stock repurchase program, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional financing.Cash Flows Year Ended October 31,$ Change 202220212021 to 2022 (dollars in millions)Cash provided by operating activities$1,738.9 $1,492.6 $246.3 Cash used in investing activities$(572.6)$(549.0)$(23.6)Cash used in financing activities$(1,116.3)$(748.7)$(367.6)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.43Table of ContentsThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher net income and higher accounts receivable collection, partially offset by timing of customer billings and higher disbursements for operations, including vendor and tax payments.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesThe increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions of $126.4 million and higher purchases of property and equipment of $42.8 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments of $80.8 million and lower purchases of short-term investments of $64.5 million.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesThe increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher stock repurchases of $311.9 million, higher debt repayments of $48.8 million and higher taxes paid for net share settlements of $35.1 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from issuance of common stock of $27.2 million.Credit and Term Loan FacilitiesOn January 22, 2021, we entered into a Fourth Extension and Amendment Agreement (the Fourth Amendment), which amended and restated our previous credit agreement, dated as of November 28, 2016 (as amended and restated, the Credit Agreement). Our outstanding borrowings under the previous credit agreement, which as of January 22, 2021 consisted of term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $97.5 million, were carried over under the Credit Agreement and fully paid on November 26, 2021. The Fourth Amendment extended the termination date of the existing $650.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) from November 28, 2021 to January 22, 2024, which could be further extended at our option. The Credit Agreement also provides an uncommitted incremental loan facility of up to $150.0 million in the aggregate principal amount. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of October 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.There was no outstanding balance under the Revolver as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021. We expect our borrowings, if any, under the Revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2022, the Revolver bore interest at LIBOR +1%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.125% and 0.200% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment.In July 2018, we entered into a 12-year 220.0 million Renminbi (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support our facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5-year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%. As of October 31, 2022, we had a $20.8 million outstanding balance under the agreement.Stock Repurchase ProgramOur Board of Directors (the Board) previously approved a stock repurchase program (the Program) with authorization to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock in December 2021. The Board approved a replenishment of the Program up to $1.5 billion in September 2022. During the fiscal year 2022, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $314.51 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.1 billion. As of October 31, 2022, $1.4 billion remained available for future stock repurchases. The pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions, our debt repayment obligations, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. The IR Act was enacted in the United States on August 16, 2022. The IR Act imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after December 31, 2022. The total taxable value of shares repurchased is reduced by the fair market value of any newly issued shares during the taxable year. We are assessing the potential impact of the stock repurchase excise tax. Based on our preliminary assessment, we do not expect a material impact on our overall capital allocation strategy or our consolidated financial statements. Risks related to the IR Act are described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.44Table of ContentsContractual and Other ObligationsOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. LeasesWe have operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets. As of October 31, 2022, we had lease payment obligations, net of immaterial sublease income, of $569.3 million, with $54.5 million payable within 12 months.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of October 31, 2022, we had $661.1 million of purchase obligations, with $367.4 million payable within 12 months. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.Term Loan Refer to ""Credit and Term Loan Facilities” under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Long Term Accrued Income TaxesAs of October 31, 2022, we had $18.8 million of long-term accrued income taxes which represent uncertain tax benefits. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2022 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to financial market risks, primarily due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and non-marketable equity security price. None of market risk sensitive instruments are held for speculative trading purposes.Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2022, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and debt were at short-term variable or fixed interest rates. As of October 31, 2022, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $147.9 million. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 45Table of ContentsOur cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of October 31, 2022 were as follows: Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 20232024202520262027 and thereafterTotalFair Value (in thousands)Cash & Cash equivalents$1,227,136 $1,227,136 $1,227,136 Approx. average interest rate0.70 %Short-term investments$82,264 $39,410 $17,705 $2,265 $6,269 $147,913 $147,913 Approx. average coupon rate2.01 %2.01 %3.11 %0.98 %1.45 %Short-term debt (variable rate):Credit Facility in China$20,824 $20,824 $20,824 Average interest rateLPR + 0.74% of such rateForeign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. A weakening U.S. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into U.S. dollars in our consolidated statements of income. Likewise, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, including the renminbi or Yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, this could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In addition, increased international sales in the future may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 27 months. See Note 2 and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors, including interest rate changes and political and economic uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2022, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $19.5 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $19.5 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in positive cash flow of approximately $19.5 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record gains or losses, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. Although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 46Table of ContentsInformation about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2022 was as follows:Gross NotionalAmount inU.S. DollarsAverageContractRate (in thousands) Forward Contract Values:Indian rupee$368,282 82.500 Japanese yen264,649 146.852 Euro195,285 1.086 Taiwanese dollar130,412 29.967 Canadian dollar102,201 1.321 Chinese renminbi90,436 7.214 Korean won83,935 1,289.396 Hungarian forint51,056 423.933 British pound sterling41,817 1.234 Israel shekel38,386 3.419 Singapore dollar10,498 1.396 Swiss franc9,183 0.958 $1,386,140 Equity Price Risk. Our non-marketable equity securities investments totaled $31.9 million and $17.6 million as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our strategic investments include privately-held companies that are considered to be in the start-up or development stages and have a higher inherent risk. Specifically, the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. These investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover. The evaluation of these investments is based on information provided by these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data provided.47Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:29:58.324698

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverviewThe following overview is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7, the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K, and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto set forth in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements.Fiscal 2023 Financial Performance SummaryThe following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year Ended October 31, 202320222021 (in millions, except per share amounts)Revenue$5,842.6 $5,081.5 $4,204.2 Cost of revenue$1,222.2 $1,063.7 $861.8 Operating expenses$3,351.2 $2,855.8 $2,607.6 Operating income$1,269.3 $1,162.0 $734.8 Net income attributed to Synopsys$1,229.9 $984.6 $757.5 Diluted net income per share attributed to Synopsys$7.92 $6.29 $4.81 Fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 financial performance summary•Revenues were $5.8 billion, an increase of $761.1 million or 15%, primarily due to revenue growth across all products and geographies.•Total cost of revenue and operating expenses was $4.6 billion, an increase of $653.9 million or 17%, primarily due to an increase of $287.7 million in employee-related costs resulting from headcount increases through organic growth and acquisitions.•Operating income was $1.3 billion, an increase of $107.2 million or 9%.For a summary of fiscal 2022 comparison to fiscal 2021, see the discussion in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, filed on December 12, 2022.Business SummarySynopsys provides products and services used across the entire Silicon to Software spectrum to bring Smart Everything to life. From engineers creating advanced semiconductors to product teams developing advanced electronic systems to software developers seeking to ensure the security and quality of their code, our customers trust that our technologies will enable them to meet new requirements for energy efficiency, reliability, mobility, security and more. For more information about our business segments and product groups, see Part I, Item 1 Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We have consistently grown our revenue since 2005, despite periods of global economic uncertainty. We achieved these results because of our solid execution, leading technologies and strong customer relationships, and because we generally recognize our revenue for software licenses over the arrangement period, which typically approximates three years. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Polices and Basis of Presentation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion on our revenue recognition policy. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. As a result, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way.Our growth strategy is based on maintaining and building on our leadership in our Design Automation products, expanding and proliferating our Design IP offerings and continuing to expand our product portfolio and our total addressable market. Our revenue growth from period to period is expected to vary based on the mix of our time based and upfront products. Based on our leading technologies, customer relationships, business model, diligent 35Table of Contentsexpense management, and acquisition strategy, we believe that we will continue to execute our strategies successfully.Recent DevelopmentsImpact of the Current Macroeconomic and Geopolitical EnvironmentUncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including the effects of, among other things, increased global inflationary pressures and interest rates, potential economic slowdowns or recessions, supply chain disruptions, geopolitical pressures, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and associated global economic conditions, have resulted in volatility in credit, equity and foreign currency markets. We expect growth across our geographies in fiscal 2024; however, we are expecting a challenging near-term growth environment in China due to macroeconomic factors as well as, to a lesser degree, entity list and trade restrictions as further discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The current uncertain macroeconomic environment could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. For more on risks related to the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For example, we continue to experience an impact from the current macroeconomic environment in our Software Integrity segment as customers have applied elevated levels of scrutiny to purchasing decisions due in part to their own budget uncertainty, which has, in some cases, affected customer order size, pricing and/or contract duration. While the situation is dynamic, we expect customers to continue to scrutinize their budgets and negotiate orders for our Software Integrity segment products and solutions in light of the current macroeconomic environment. Further, following a strategic portfolio review, and in consultation with our Board of Directors, we have decided to explore strategic alternatives for our Software Integrity segment. As a part of this process, our management is considering a full range of strategic opportunities. At this time we cannot predict the impact that such strategic alternatives might have on our business, operations or financial condition. We are also actively monitoring geopolitical pressures around the world, including, among others, changes in the China-Taiwan relations, the conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and other regional or global military conflicts. Any significant disruption caused by these or other geopolitical pressures or conflicts could materially affect our employees, business, operating results, financial condition or customers in those regions of the world. For example, Synopsys has employees, operations, customers and strategic partners in the Middle East and in Armenia, which are each experiencing geopolitical conflicts. While we are actively monitoring these conflicts, at this time, these geopolitical conflicts have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.While our time-based business model provides stability to our business, operating results and overall financial position, the broader implications of these macroeconomic or geopolitical events, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. Further, the negative impact of these events or disruptions may be deferred due to our business model.See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the impact of global economic and geopolitical uncertainty on our business, operations and financial condition.Developments in Export Control RegulationsOn October 7, 2022, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce published changes to U.S. export control regulations (U.S. Export Regulations), including new restrictions on Chinese entities' ability to obtain advanced computing chips, develop and maintain supercomputers, and manufacture advanced semiconductors. Further, on October 14, 2022, a new rule went into effect imposing U.S. export controls on additional technologies, including electronic computer-aided design software specially designed for the development of ICs with Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor structures. On October 17, 2023, the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, published clarifications of and other adjustments to the regulations promulgated on October 7, 2022, pertaining, among other things, to China’s access to certain semiconductor and advanced computing technology. Based on our current understanding, we believe these regulations will not have a material impact on our business. We anticipate additional changes to U.S. Export Regulations in the future, but we cannot forecast the scope or timing of such changes. We will continue to monitor such developments, including potential additional trade restrictions, and other regulatory or policy changes by the U.S. and foreign governments.For more on risks related to government export and import restrictions such as the U.S. government’s Entity List and other U.S. Export Regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Industry Risks – We are subject to 36Table of Contentsgovernmental export and import requirements that could subject us to liability and restrict our ability to sell our products and services, which could impair our ability to compete in international markets.”Business SegmentsEffective in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we realigned our organizational structure to evaluate the results of our Design IP business separately. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), our Chief Executive Officer, now regularly reviews disaggregated segment information, assesses performance against our key growth strategies and allocates resources based on this new organizational structure. As a result, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we changed our reportable segments from two reportable segments to the following three reportable segments: (1) Design Automation, which includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services, system integration products and services, digital, custom and FPGA IC design software, verification software and hardware products, manufacturing software products and other; (2) Design IP, which includes our Design IP products; and (3) Software Integrity, which includes solutions that test software code for security vulnerabilities and quality defects, as well as professional and managed services. As such, prior period reportable segment results and related disclosures have been reclassified to reflect our current reportable segments.As a result of the change in reporting structure, financial information provided to and used by the CODM to assist in making operational decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance reflects consolidated financial information as well as revenue, adjusted operating income, and adjusted operating margin for the Design Automation, Design IP, and Software Integrity segments, accompanied by disaggregated information relating to revenues by geographic region.Design Automation. This segment includes our advanced silicon design, verification products and services and system integration products. This segment also includes digital, custom and FPGA IC design software, verification software and hardware products, system integration products and services, and manufacturing software products. Designers use these products to automate the highly complex IC design process and to reduce defects that could lead to expensive design or manufacturing re-spins or suboptimal end products. Design IP. This segment includes our Design IP products that serve companies primarily in the semiconductor and electronics industries. We are a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven IP solutions for system-on-chips (SoCs). This includes IP that has been optimized to address specific application requirements for the mobile, automotive, digital home, internet of things and cloud computing markets, enabling designers to quickly develop SoCs in these areas.Software Integrity. This segment includes a broad portfolio of products and services to intelligently address software risks across the customer’s portfolio and at all stages of the application lifecycle. The testing tools, services, and programs enable our customers to manage open source license compliance and detect, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities and defects across their entire software development lifecycle. Our offerings include security and quality testing products, managed services, programs and professional services, and training.Fiscal Year EndOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were 52-week years ending on October 28, 2023, October 29, 2022, and October 30, 2021, respectively. Fiscal 2024 will be a 53-week year.For presentation purposes, this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to the closest calendar month end.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and net income. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our significant accounting policies.37Table of ContentsThe accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are:•Revenue recognition; and•Business combinations.Revenue RecognitionOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Arrangements with customers can involve multiple products and various license rights. Customers can negotiate for a broad portfolio of solutions, and favorable terms along with future purchase options to manage their overall costs. Analysis of the terms and conditions in these contracts and their effect on revenue recognition may require significant judgment. We have concluded that our EDA software licenses in Technology Subscription License (TSL) contracts are not distinct from our obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because those promises represent inputs to a single, combined performance obligation. Where unspecified additional software product rights are part of the contract with the customer, those rights are accounted for as part of the single performance obligation that includes the licenses, updates, and technical support, because such rights are provided during the same period of time and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. For our IP licensing arrangements, we have concluded that the licenses and support services are distinct from each other, and therefore treated as separate performance obligations. Revenues from IP licenses are recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control of the IP license, and support services are recognized over the support period as a stand ready obligation to the customer.We are required to estimate total consideration expected to be received from contracts with customers. In some circumstances, the consideration expected to be received is variable based on the specific terms of the contract or based on our expectations of the term of the contract. Generally, we have not experienced significant returns or refunds to customers. These estimates require significant judgment and the change in these estimates could have an effect on our results of operations during the periods involved.Business CombinationsWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date with the exception of contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) which are recognized and measured on the acquisition date in accordance with our ""Revenue Recognition"" policy in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as if we had originated the contracts. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions including our estimates for intangible assets. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include, but are not limited to:•future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;•estimated obsolescence rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets;•the expected use of the acquired assets; and•discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value, which are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks.38Table of ContentsThe fair value of the definite-lived intangibles was determined using variations of the income approach.For acquisitions completed in fiscal 2023, the fair value for acquired existing technology was determined by applying the relief from royalty method under the income approach. The relief from royalty method applies a royalty rate to projected income to quantify the benefit of owning the intangible asset rather than paying a royalty for use of the asset. The economic useful life was determined based on historical technology obsolescence patterns and prospective technology developments. We assumed royalty rates ranging from 40% to 55%. The present value of operating cash flows from the existing technology was determined using discount rates ranging from approximately 10% to 20%.Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships with the acquired company’s customers. Their fair value was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach, which involves isolating the net earnings attributable to the asset being measured based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the asset over its remaining useful life. The economic useful life was determined based on historical customer turnover rates. Projected income from existing customer relationships considered customer retention rates ranging from 85% to 100%. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates ranging from approximately 10% to 20%.We believe that our estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of acquired intangible assets are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.Results of OperationsThe discussion of our consolidated results of operations includes year-over-year comparisons of fiscal 2023 changes compared to fiscal 2022. We have also included a comparison of segment results for fiscal 2022 and 2021 due to the change in reportable segments in the beginning of fiscal 2023. For a discussion of other fiscal 2022 changes compared to fiscal 2021, see the discussion in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, filed on December 12, 2022.Revenue Our revenues are generated from three business segments: the Design Automation segment, the Design IP segment and the Software Integrity segment. See Note 17. Segment Disclosure of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our reportable segments and revenue by geographic regions. Further disaggregation of the revenues into various products and services within these three segments is summarized as follows:Design Automation Segment•EDA solutions include digital, custom and FPGA IC design software, verification software and hardware products, system integration products and services, and obligations to provide unspecified updates and support services. EDA products and services are typically sold through TSL arrangements that grant customers the right to access and use all of the licensed products at the outset of an arrangement; software updates are generally made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. The duration of our TSL contracts is generally three years, though it may vary for specific arrangements. We have concluded that the software licenses in TSL contracts are not distinct from the obligation to provide unspecified software updates to the licensed software throughout the license term, because the multiple software licenses and support represent inputs to a single, combined offering, and timely, relevant software updates are integral to maintaining the utility of the software licenses. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation under TSL contracts ratably over the term of the license. •In the case of arrangements involving the sale of hardware products, we generally have two performance obligations. The first performance obligation is to transfer the hardware product, which includes software integral to the functionality of the hardware product. The second performance obligation is to provide maintenance on the hardware and its embedded software, which includes rights to technical support, hardware repairs and software updates that are all provided over the same term and have the same time-based pattern of transfer to the customer. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the hardware product is generally recognized as revenue at the time of shipment because 39Table of Contentsthe customer obtains control of the product at that point in time. We have concluded that control generally transfers at that point in time because the customer has the ability to direct the use of the asset and an obligation to pay for the hardware. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the maintenance obligation is recognized as revenue ratably over the maintenance term. •Revenue from Professional Service contracts is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. We have a history of reasonably estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes.Design IP Segment•Design IP includes our Synopsys IP portfolio. These arrangements generally have two performance obligations which consist of transferring of the licensed IP and providing related support, which includes rights to technical support and software updates that are provided over the support term and are transferred to the customer over time. Revenue allocated to the IP licenses is recognized at a point in time upon the later of the delivery date or the beginning of the license period, and revenue allocated to support is recognized over the support term. Royalties are recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the applicable customer sells its products that incorporate our IP. Payments for IP contracts are generally received upon delivery of the IP. Revenue related to the customization of certain IP is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress.Software Integrity Segment•We sell Software Integrity products in arrangements that provide customers the right to software licenses, maintenance updates and technical support. Over the term of these arrangements, the customer expects us to provide integral maintenance updates to the software licenses, which help customers protect their own software from new critical quality defects and potential security vulnerabilities. The licenses and maintenance updates serve together to fulfill our commitment to the customer as both work together to provide functionality to the customer and represent a combined performance obligation. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over the term of the arrangement.Our customer arrangements can involve multiple products and various license rights, and our customers negotiate with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they generally request a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in highly competitive markets. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes.Total RevenueYear Ended October 31,$ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2023202220212023 vs. 20222022 vs. 2021(dollars in millions)Design Automation$3,775.3 $3,300.2 $2,754.7 $475.1 14 %$545.5 20 %Design IP1,542.7 1,315.5 1,055.7 227.2 17 %259.8 25 %Software Integrity524.6 465.8 393.8 58.8 13 %72.0 18 %Total$5,842.6 $5,081.5 $4,204.2 $761.1 15 %$877.3 21 %Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements including the timing and value of contract renewals. For example, we experience fluctuations in our revenues due to factors such as the timing of IP product sales, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) drawdowns, royalties, and hardware products sales. As revenues from IP products sales and hardware products sales are recognized upfront, customer demand and timing requirements for such IP products and hardware products could result in increased variability of our total revenues.Contracted but unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations (backlog) as of October 31, 2023 were approximately $8.6 billion, which includes $1.4 billion in non-cancellable FSA commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. We have elected to exclude future sales-based royalty payments from the remaining performance obligations. 40Table of ContentsApproximately 40% of the backlog as of October 31, 2023, excluding non-cancellable FSA, is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. The majority of the remaining backlog is expected to be recognized in the following three years. The backlog was approximately $7.1 billion as of October 31, 2022, which included $1.1 billion in non-cancellable FSA commitments from customers.The amount and composition of unsatisfied performance obligations will fluctuate period to period. We do not believe the amount. of unsatisfied performance obligations is indicative of future sales or revenue, or that such obligations at the end of any given period correlates with actual sales performance of a particular geography or particular products and services. For more information regarding our revenue as of October 31, 2023, including our contract balances as of such date, see Note 3. Revenue of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.For fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, revenues increased due to the continued organic growth of our business in all product groups and geographies.For a discussion of revenue by geographic areas, see Note 17.

Such fluctuations will continue to be impacted by the timing of shipments and FSA drawdowns due to customer requirements.Maintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31, 20232022$ Change% Change (dollars in millions)Maintenance revenue$361.7 $293.3 $68.4 23 %Professional service and other revenue668.0 567.7 100.3 18 %Total$1,029.7 $861.0 $168.7 20 %Percentage of total revenue18 %17 %The increase in maintenance revenue for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the volume of hardware arrangements that include maintenance.The increase in professional services and other revenue for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to the timing of IP customization projects.41Table of ContentsCost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, 20232022$ Change% Change (dollars in millions)Cost of products revenue$763.5 $653.8 $109.7 17 %Cost of maintenance and service revenue383.8 343.0 40.8 12 %Amortization of intangible assets74.9 66.9 8.0 12 %Total$1,222.2 $1,063.7 $158.5 15 %Percentage of total revenue21 %21 %We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of products revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets.Cost of products revenue. Cost of products revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, hardware-related costs including inventory provisions, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution, royalties paid to third-party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized software development costs.Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes costs to deliver our maintenance services, such as hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates.Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, included in cost of revenue, consists of the amortization of core/developed technology and certain contract rights intangible assets related to acquisitions.The increase in cost of revenue for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to increases of $62.2 million in employee-related costs as a result of headcount increases from hiring, $53.5 million in hardware-related costs including inventory provisions, $13.1 million in facility costs, $8.0 million in amortization of technology-related intangible assets, $6.7 million in costs to fulfill IP consulting arrangements, and $6.1 million in the change in fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets.Operating ExpensesResearch and Development Year Ended October 31, 20232022$ Change% Change (dollars in millions)Research and development expenses$1,946.8 $1,680.4 $266.4 16 %Percentage of total revenue33 %33 %The increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher employee-related costs of $139.2 million as a result of headcount increases as we continue to expand and enhance our product portfolio, increases of $57.4 million in the change in fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets, $31.0 million in facility costs, and $20.9 million in consultant and contractor costs.Sales and Marketing Year Ended October 31, 20232022$ Change% Change (dollars in millions)Sales and marketing expenses$889.0 $779.8 $109.2 14 %Percentage of total revenue15 %15 %The increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to increases of $62.9 million in employee-related costs due to headcount increases and higher sales commissions, $13.4 million in the change in fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets, $12.0 million in travel and marketing costs due to an increased number of in-person meetings and events, and $8.5 million in facility costs.42Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Year Ended October 31, 20232022$ Change% Change (dollars in millions)General and administrative expenses$410.3 $353.8 $56.5 16 %Percentage of total revenue7 %7 %The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to increases of $23.4 million in personnel-related costs due to headcount increases from hiring, $16.4 million in maintenance and depreciation expenses, $12.9 million in the change in fair value of our executive deferred compensation plan assets, and $7.4 million in legal, consulting and other professional fees. These increases were partially offset by bad debt recoveries of $15.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Change in Fair Value of Deferred CompensationThe income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net.

Restructuring ChargesIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we initiated a restructuring plan for involuntary employee terminations as part of a business reorganization (the 2023 Plan). The 2023 Plan was substantially completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and total charges under the 2023 Plan were $77.0 million, consisting primarily of severance costs and facility exit costs.The following is a summary of our restructuring liabilities:Fiscal YearBalance at Beginning of PeriodCosts IncurredCash PaymentsBalance at End of Period(dollars in millions)2023$— $77.0 $(68.3)$8.7 2022$14.2 $12.1 $(26.3)$— 2021$1.3 $33.4 $(20.5)$14.2 See Note 18.

We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.In 2017, the Hungarian Tax Authority (the HTA) assessed withholding taxes of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million, against our Hungary subsidiary (Synopsys Hungary). Synopsys Hungary contested the assessment with the Hungarian Administrative Court (Administrative Court). In 2019, as required under Hungarian law, Synopsys Hungary paid the assessment and recorded a tax expense due to an unrecognized tax benefit of $17.4 million, which is net of estimated U.S. foreign tax credits. During 2021 and 2022 a series of appeals, hearings and re-hearings occurred at the Administrative Court and Hungarian Supreme Court. Hearings with the Administrative Court were held on June 30, 2022, September 22, 2022 and April 25, 2023. The Administrative Court issued its written decision in favor of Synopsys Hungary on May 17, 2023, and subsequently refunded Synopsys Hungary the tax, penalty and interest paid in fiscal 2018, as well as additional interest all totaling $39.1 million (including the effect of currency movement). The refunded tax, penalty and interest was recognized as an income tax benefit. The HTA had until July 14, 2023, to file an appeal with the Hungarian Supreme Court and the HTA did not appeal. This concludes the litigation. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Synopsys released its unrecognized tax benefit and offsetting U.S. foreign tax credits, resulting in a net benefit of $23.8 million.See Note 15. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the provision for income taxes, the impacts related to the Tax Act, and the Hungarian audit.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our revolving credit and term loan facilities. As of October 31, 2023, we held $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We also held $2.3 million in restricted cash primarily associated with deposits for office leases and employee loan programs. Our cash equivalents consisted primarily of taxable money market mutual funds, time deposits and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less. Our short-term investments include U.S. government and municipal obligations, investment-grade available-for-sale debt and asset backed securities with an overall weighted-average credit rating of approximately AA. As of October 31, 2023, approximately $753.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions. We have provided for foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and development efforts. We also may invest in or acquire businesses, applications or technologies, or may further expand our board-authorized stock repurchase program, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional financing.Effective fiscal 2023, our research and development expenditures are required to be capitalized and amortized under the Tax Act instead of being deducted when incurred for US tax purposes. As a result of the IRS tax relief for the California winter storms, the due date for our fiscal 2023 federal tax payment was November 16, 2023 and as such, we have deferred our fiscal 2023 federal cash tax payments until the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This results in 45Table of Contentsa significant increase to our cash outflows beginning in fiscal 2024. See Note 15. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Cash Flows Year Ended October 31, 20232022$ Change (dollars in millions)Cash provided by operating activities$1,703.3 $1,738.9 $(35.6)Cash used in investing activities$(482.1)$(572.6)$90.5 Cash used in financing activities$(1,196.9)$(1,116.3)$(80.6)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesWe expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, and the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront arrangements much sooner than from time-based products revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license.The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the timing of customer billings and higher disbursements for operations, partially offset by higher net income and higher accounts receivable collection.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesThe decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to lower cash paid for acquisitions of $124.7 million and higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments of $44.6 million, partially offset by higher purchases of property and equipment of $53.0 million and higher purchases of investments of $27.3 million.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesThe increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher stock repurchases of $105.7 million, higher taxes paid for net share settlements of $67.4 million partially offset by lower debt repayments of $74.2 million and higher proceeds from issuance of common stock of $15.0 million.Credit and Term Loan FacilitiesOn December 14, 2022, we entered into a Fifth Extension and Amendment Agreement (the Fifth Amendment), which amended and restated our previous credit agreement, dated as of January 22, 2021 (as amended and restated, the Credit Agreement). The Fifth Amendment increased the existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) from $650.0 million to $850.0 million and extended the maturity date from January 22, 2024 to December 14, 2027, which could be further extended at our option. The Credit Agreement also provides an uncommitted incremental revolving loan facility of up to $150.0 million in the aggregate principal amount. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, as well as other non-financial covenants. There was no outstanding balance under the Revolver as of October 31, 2023.In July 2018, we entered into a 12-year 220.0 million Renminbi (approximately $33.0 million) credit agreement with a lender in China to support our facilities expansion. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on the 5-year Loan Prime Rate plus 0.74%. As of October 31, 2023, we had a $18.1 million outstanding balance under the agreement. See Note 7. Financial Assets and Liabilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Stock Repurchase ProgramIn fiscal 2022, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock. During the fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 3.0 million shares of common stock at an average price of $387.92 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion. As of October 31, 2023, $194.3 million remained available for future stock repurchases. The pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions, our debt repayment obligations, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. 46Table of ContentsThe IR Act was enacted in the United States on August 16, 2022. The IR Act imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after December 31, 2022. The total taxable value of shares repurchased is reduced by the fair market value of any newly issued shares during the taxable year. As of October 31, 2023, this does not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. Risks related to the IR Act are described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.Material Cash RequirementsOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. LeasesWe have operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets. As of October 31, 2023, we had lease payment obligations, net of immaterial sublease income, of $614.8 million, with $84.6 million payable within 12 months.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of October 31, 2023, we had $604.3 million of purchase obligations, with $464.2 million payable within 12 months. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms may allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.Term LoanRefer to ""Credit and Term Loan Facilities” under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Long Term Accrued Income TaxesAs of October 31, 2023, we had $22.0 million of long-term accrued income taxes which represent uncertain tax benefits. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments related to uncertain tax benefits in individual years beyond fiscal 2023 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to financial market risks, primarily due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and non-marketable equity security price. None of market risk sensitive instruments are held for speculative trading purposes.Interest Rate Risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the invested principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk exposure. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2023, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and debt were at short-term variable or fixed interest rates. As of October 31, 2023, we had short term fixed income investment portfolio of $151.6 million. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. 47Table of ContentsOur cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of October 31, 2023 are as follows: Maturing in Year Ending 20242025202620272028 and thereafterTotalFair Value (in thousands)Cash & Cash equivalents$1,343,860 $1,343,860 $1,343,860 Approx. average interest rate2.44 %Short-term investments$73,879 $38,851 $24,558 $9,501 $4,850 $151,639 $151,639 Approx. average coupon rate2.07 %3.19 %3.71 %5.11 %4.48 %Short-term debt (variable rate):Credit Facility in China$18,078 $18,078 $18,078 Average interest rateLPR +0.74% of such rateForeign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. A weakening U.S. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into U.S. dollars in our consolidated statements of income. Likewise, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, including the renminbi or Yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, this could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In addition, increased international sales in the future may result in greater foreign currency denominated sales, increasing our foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 27 months. See Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation and Note 7. Financial Assets and Liabilities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts.The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. Exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations due to a number of factors, including interest rate changes and political and economic uncertainty. Therefore, we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below as of October 31, 2023, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $26.1 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $26.1 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in positive cash flow of approximately $26.1 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts.If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record gains or losses, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. Although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 48Table of ContentsInformation about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2023 is as follows:Gross NotionalAmount inU.S. DollarsAverageContractRate (in thousands) Forward Contract Values:Indian rupee$523,162 84.792 Japanese yen286,654 144.426 Euro260,562 1.086 Chinese renminbi146,652 0.141 Canadian dollar141,956 1.359 Taiwanese dollar103,717 30.778 Korean won80,903 1,326.344 Israel shekel47,809 3.768 British pound sterling32,556 0.819 Armenian dram19,716 399.587 Singapore dollar12,166 1.340 Swiss franc8,324 0.865 Hungarian forint2,581 359.851 $1,666,758 Equity Price Risk.

We also provide intellectual property (IP) and design services to simplify the design process, and accelerate time-to-market for our customers. We incorporated in 1986 in North Carolina and reincorporated in Delaware in 1987. Our headquarters are located at 700 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View, California 94043 and our telephone number is (650) 584-5000. We have more than 60 offices throughout North America, Europe, Japan and Asia. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Proxy Statements relating to our annual meetings of stockholders, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports and filings made by our executive officers and directors are available on our Internet website (www.synopsys.com). We post these reports to our website as soon as practicable after we file them with the SEC. The contents of our website are not part of this Form 10-K. The Role of EDA in the Electronics Industry Technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density, speed, power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors (also referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips). 1 •Since the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the widths of the wires imprinted on the chip that form the transistors) and other developments have enabled IC manufacturers to follow ""Moore's law,"" approximately doubling every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip. As a result, state-of-the-art ICs now hold over one hundred million transistors and have feature widths of 90 nanometers (billionths of a meter), going to 65 nanometers and below. •Microprocessors operating at more than 4 gigahertz, a speed unheard of only a few years ago, are readily available today. •Chips have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more powerful handheld devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, music players and personal digital assistants. •Increasingly, single SoCs can handle functions formerly performed by multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board. Combined, these advances in semiconductor technology have driven development of lower cost, higher performance computers, wireless communications networks, hand held devices, Internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as Synopsys. The IC Design Process EDA software is central to the IC design process, enabling designers to design complex semiconductors by using a high-level, abstract description of the function of the chip. EDA software is used to automatically translate this description into successively more detailed forms, and to verify at each stage in the design process that the chip's design is sound and that the chip when manufactured will function as originally intended. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of system design, register transfer level design, logic design, functional verification, physical design and physical verification. System Design. In system design, the designer describes the chip's desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized high-level computer language, typically C++ or System C. This phase yields a relatively high-level behavioral model of the chip. Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design. RTL design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high-level computer language, typically Verilog or VHDL. This is the stage where the functionality of the final design is captured in enough detail to begin simulation and verification and determine that the final product will function as expected in the verification phase. Logic Design. Logic design, or ""synthesis,"" programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of the chip, and produce a data file known as a net list describing the various groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip. Related programs insert the additional circuitry into the design that will be needed to test the chip after manufacture. In a growing number of designs, designers are increasingly performing ""design planning"" in which the designer determines the location of the major functional ""blocks"" on the SoC prior to logic synthesis. Functional Verification. At the RTL and gate level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools such as RTL simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to simulate large sets of inputs that a given IC design might confront in a real-life operation. By running these extensive tests, the designer can verify that the design will function as intended. 2 Physical Design. In the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with ""place and route"" products. The designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within each block, a process known as ""placement."" In many designs, placement is performed in conjunction with logic synthesis, a process known as ""physical synthesis."" After placement the designer adds the connections between the transistors, a process known as ""routing."" The output of place and route programs is one or more data files that can be read by physical verification or mask data preparation programs. Physical Verification. Before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer must perform a series of further verification steps, checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip. The designer may need to add features to the design to ensure that the chip can be manufactured successfully. The completion of this final phase is called ""tapeout."" In actual chip design, each of these steps has a number of additional elements, and designers often undertake the various design and verification steps in a different order than described above, and repeat one or more steps (particularly functional and physical verification) multiple times. Further, several of the steps, especially logic design and physical design, are becoming more integrated with each other. If at any stage of the process the designer determines the chip design will not perform as intended, the designer must go back one or more steps and correct the problem, then continue through subsequent steps. Recreating a chip's logic design, performing simulation over again, and repeating other steps all take time. Each such iteration adds significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet time-to-market goals. Current Issues Facing IC Designers As chip technology continues to advance, our customers are seeking to maximize the quality of results of their IC design efforts, while minimizing the costs of achieving these results and shortening the time needed to launch the manufactured IC, as follows: •Quality of Results. Customers are concerned about differentiating their chips from their competitors' in a number of areas, including size or area, speed, functionality, power consumption and performance. The designer must balance each issue against the others, making key tradeoff decisions—often through multiple iterations—to reach a final design. As chips become more complex and manufacturing geometries shrink, this balancing of factors becomes disproportionately more difficult, and requires designers to successfully address technical issues, including: •Timing closure: achieving consistency between the speed of the chip at the logic design phase and the speed of the chip at the physical design phase; •Signal integrity: ensuring chip performance is not affected by unintended electrical effects, like cross-talk and other forms of interference, that occur as the wires on a chip get more narrow and closer together; •Power management: reducing the chip's power consumption, an important objective for chips to be used in battery-operated devices, particularly in the case of laptop computers and cell phones where both longer battery life and lower power drain in standby mode is critical; •Design for test: embedding circuits in the design that allow the chip, once manufactured, to be tested rapidly and at a reasonable cost; •Verification: verifying that the chip will perform as intended, which has become the single most time-consuming and resource intensive aspect of overall design; 3 •Manufacturability: faithfully translating the design produced by EDA tools into a manufacturable pattern of wires and transistors on the chip has become significantly more difficult as a result of decreasing feature widths and increasing feature density; and •Yield: ensuring that an acceptable number of good chips per wafer can be manufactured successfully. •Cost of Results. Customers are continually seeking to constrain their costs, including costs of design, masks, equipment, facilities and support, all of which typically increase as chips become more complex. The higher the cost, the higher the expected volume of chips the customer must sell to make a given chip project profitable. Faced with increasing costs, our customers continue to focus intensely on controlling their research and development and manufacturing costs, including their EDA software costs and maximizing their yield in manufacture. As a result, many of our customers have begun consolidating suppliers to improve their purchasing terms and, more importantly, to gain the benefits of better integrated products. •Time to Results. Finally, customers are seeking to improve the predictability of their production schedule. Economic pressures, competition and continuing innovation continue to shorten the life cycle of electronic products. Accordingly, time-to-market is critical to a product's commercial success. The design time for a product's IC components is a major determining factor of that product's time-to-market. Accordingly, our customers require EDA products that can address the challenges described above while reducing overall design time. Strategy We provide products and services that help our customers design leading-edge ICs while maximizing achievement of their quality of results, cost of results and time to results goals. Historically, customers have purchased individual ""point tools"" to complete one or more tasks or sets of tasks in the design process, dealing internally with moving from one design environment or data set to the next, while integrating various products—or even developing design tools—themselves where necessary. However, with the increasing complexity of IC design, cost pressures and ever smaller market windows, customers require broader solutions with greater performance from fewer vendors at lower costs. To meet this need, we have combined our individual products—many of which lead their respective categories—into platforms, or collections of products that are integrated through the use of common interfaces, data sets and other technologies, to deliver a comprehensive, faster and more reliable design flow. In fiscal 2003, we released our Galaxy™ Design and Discovery™ Verification platforms, which together provide complete implementation and verification solutions to our customers. In fiscal 2004, we delivered the Galaxy 2004 platform, providing full, cross-platform correlation in area, timing, power, signal integrity and test, as well as significant speed and capacity improvement. We also delivered substantial improvements to the capabilities, speed, capacity and accuracy of our Discovery Verification platform. To help our customers better manage time, cost and risk, we have also continued to invest in pre-designed, pre-verified and reusable intellectual property blocks our customers can use rather than build internally. These blocks include our DesignWare® Foundation Library of reusable, basic chip elements which can be pulled into designs during logic synthesis, our DesignWare Verification Library of reusable chip function models to accelerate simulation and verification, and our DesignWare Cores that implement many of the most important industry standards for digital and analog connectivity, including USB and PCI Express. We also provide professional services to assist our customers with their most difficult design challenges. 4 Finally, recognizing the challenges of manufacturing at feature widths smaller that the wavelength of light, and envisioning the benefits of taking manufacturing and yield issues into account during the design process, we have also continued to invest in our portfolio of Design for Manufacturing tools and technologies. Organization We operate in a single segment and are currently organized into four primary groups: Implementation, Verification, Silicon Engineering and Solutions. •Implementation Group: develops and markets the products included in the Galaxy Design Platform and related products. •Verification Group: develops and markets the products included in the Discovery Verification Platform and related products. •Silicon Engineering Group: focuses on our Design for Manufacturing initiatives and analog/mixed-signal design and verification products. •Solutions Group: develops and markets our DesignWare® portfolio of pre-designed IP solutions for chip designers and provides turnkey IC design and on-site design assistance, among other services.

Our fiscal 2004 release of the Astro tool runs up to two times faster and has up to a 40% increase in capacity. •PrimeTime®/PrimeTime® SI timing analysis products that measure and analyze the speed at which a design will operate when it is fabricated. The PrimeTime SI tool analyzes the effect of cross-talk and noise on timing, an increasingly important issue at chip geometries below 180 nanometers. The 2004 version of our PrimeTime tool runs up to three times faster and has up to three times the capacity as the prior version. •Tetra Max® test pattern generation product family which automatically generates high-quality test vectors to improve the design process. •Star-RCXT™ extraction solution for analyzing IC layout data and determining key electrical characteristics of a chip, such as capacitance and resistance. •Hercules™ physical verification product family, which performs hierarchial design-rule checking, electrical rule checking, and layout versus schematic verification. During fiscal 2004, we delivered a faster version of the Hercules tool with higher multi-CPU scalability and broader foundry support. •Milkyway™ Database, a common design data repository which enables better interoperability among implementation and analysis tools. Storing design data in this single database with rapid read/write access can reduce data translation times between tools and inconsistent interpretations of diverse data. Interfaces to our open Milkyway database have been made available to our customers and other EDA vendors to reduce integration costs for our customers and advance tool interoperability in the industry. The Galaxy Design Platform provides our customers a single, integrated IC design solution based on leading individual products and incorporating common libraries and consistent timing, delay calculation and constraints throughout the design process. The platform uses our open Milkyway database and allows designers the flexibility to integrate internally developed and third-party tools. With this advanced functionality, common foundation and flexibility, our Galaxy Design Platform helps reduce design times, decrease integration costs and minimize the risks inherent in advanced, complex IC designs. During fiscal 2004, we released the Galaxy 2004 platform, the latest version of the Galaxy Design Platform, which delivers significantly improved quality of results, time to results and cost of results through greater correlation among the platform's individual products in addressing area, timing, power, signal integrity and test issues. We also introduced our Galaxy Power solution in fiscal 2004, offering designers the ability to improve the power efficiency of their ICs. 6 Verification Group Discovery Verification Platform. Our Discovery Verification Platform includes our verification and simulation products. The increasing size and complexity of today's ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to 70% of total design time. As a result, reducing verification ""risk"" (i.e. minimizing the possibility of finding design ""bugs"" when the ICs are delivered from the foundry) has become increasingly important to customers. To manage and reduce this verification risk, our Discovery platform combines our simulation and verification products and design-for-verification methodologies, and provides a consistent control environment to significantly improve the speed, breadth and accuracy of our customers' verification efforts. Our Discovery Verification Platform includes the following principal products: •VCS® functional verification product, the engine of the Discovery Verification Platform and often used in simulation ""farms"" consisting of hundreds of computers. The VCS product includes technologies that support model development, testbench creation, coverage feedback and debugging techniques. Our fiscal 2004 release of the VCS product expands support of our Vera® product, making testbench automation native to VCS, and helping post a two to five times improvement in runtime. •System Studio system level design product focused on system-level algorithm and architecture design and analysis, as well as the interaction between software and hardware and permits designers to model various architectural alternatives for their chips at a system level. •Vera® testbench generator, which automates the creation of testbenches, custom models that provide simulation inputs and respond to simulated outputs from the design during verification. Automating this process significantly improves verification quality. The 2004 release of the Vera product is up to 10 times faster than its predecessor and is also available native to the VCS product, providing increased productivity benefits. •LEDA® design rule checker, which enhances a designer's ability to check a design to ensure it can be for synthesized, simulated, tested and reused. •Formality® formal verification solution, which compares two versions of a design to determine if they are equivalent. The use of formal verification reduces the need to perform functional verification, which is substantially more time-consuming, thus potentially saving a significant amount of time in the overall design process. •Magellan™ hybrid formal verification product, which combines functional and formal verification technologies to allow engineers to find deep, corner-case design defects during verification. •NanoSim® simulation and analysis product for analog and mixed signal verification, which offers circuit simulation, timing and power analysis in a single solution. The NanoSim product is a key component of our Discovery AMS verification solution. •HSPICE® circuit simulator, which offers high-accuracy, transistor-level circuit simulation, thereby enabling designers to better predict the timing, power consumption and functionality of their designs. During fiscal 2004, we announced enhancements to the HSPICE tool resulting in significant improvements in performance and support for high-frequency and RF IC designs. •Verification IP reusable IP that are designed to test specific functions and adherence to industry protocols in an IC design, which we believe is becoming increasingly important to more quickly achieving verification sign-off. In fiscal 2004, we delivered the Discovery AMS solution, a subset of our verification technologies optimized to perform verification on analog and mixed signal designs. 7 Silicon Engineering Group Our Silicon Engineering Group develops and markets our products and initiatives relating to design for manufacturing and analog/mixed signal IC design and verification. Design for Manufacturing. We offer a variety of products and technologies used at the intersection of IC design and manufacturing which address a number of issues, principally the need to precisely model structures in small geometry ICs and the problems encountered when using photolithography techniques to manufacture ICs containing feature dimensions smaller than the wavelength of light during production. These products are designed to enhance yield, which is becoming increasingly challenging as chip geometries continue to shrink. In addition to our Hercules product, described above under the Galaxy platform our Design for Manufacturing initiatives include our: •TCAD products, which precisely model individual structures or devices within an IC design to help ensure manufacturability at small geometries. We see TCAD tools as increasingly important to help customers shorten the time to ramp up their production yields, and therefore reduce their manufacturing costs. In this regard, we have made significant investments to expand our TCAD offering, including our November 2004 acquisition of ISE Integrated Systems Engineering AG, a privately-held Swiss company which offered various TCAD products, including three dimensional devise simulators. We also introduced our Taurus Process Atomistic product which models processes at the atomic level for improved performance. •Proteus OPC/InPhase optical proximity correction (OPC) products which embed and verify corrective features in an IC design and masks to improve manufacturing results for subwavelength feature width design. OPC changes mask geometries to compensate for distortions caused by optical diffraction and resist process effects. During fiscal 2004, we announced improvements to Proteus to provide near linear scalability. •Phase Shift Masking Technologies consist of mask design techniques that use optical interference to improve depth-of-field and resolution in subwavelength photolithography for designs at 90 nanometers and below. •SiVL® (Silicon versus Layout) layout verification product that verifies the layout of a subwavelength IC against the silicon it is intended to produce by reading in the layout and simulating lithographic process effects, including optical, resist and etch effects. •CATS® mask data preparation product that takes a final IC design and ""fractures"" or ""breaks"" it into the physical features that will be included in the photomasks to be used in manufacturing. •Virtual Stepper® mask qualification product, which checks mask quality and analyzes printability of mask defects, helping to separate true defects from nuisance defects. Analog and Mixed-Signal Tools. The Silicon Engineering Group also manages a number of products described above and functionally included in our Galaxy and Discovery platforms that have advanced analog and mixed-signal design capabilities. These products include the NanoSim and HSPICE circuit simulators. In addition, this category includes our Cosmos™ product, which uses schematic-driven layout technology to place and route full-custom ICs, and our Circuit Explorer optimization and analysis product for complex analog designs. Solutions Group Synopsys' Solutions Group includes our portfolio of IP products and components and our Professional Services Group. Intellectual Property Products. As IC designs continue to grow in size, reusing proven design blocks has become an increasingly important way to reduce overall design cost and cycle time. Because 8 verification accounts for such a large proportion of total chip design time, reusing pre-designed and verified IP components can keep projects on schedule by ensuring that the ""designed in"" portions of the chip are ""pre-verified"" and thus will not contain errors. The ability to reuse such IP allows IC companies to focus their design teams on designing the chip features that will give its products a competitive advantage. For these reasons, IC designers are consolidating their IP purchases from fewer vendors who can provide a reliable, comprehensive portfolio of proven IP. Our IP products include: •DesignWare Foundation Library is an extensive library of basic chip elements (for example, adders and multipliers) which Design Compiler incorporates into the design during the logic synthesis stage. •DesignWare Verification Library is our library of popular chip function models used during the verification process of chip design. •DesignWare Cores are pre-designed and pre-verified digital and mixed-signal design blocks that implement many of the most important industry standards, including USB (1.1, 2.0 and On-The-Go), PCI (PCI, PCI-X and PCI Express), Ethernet and JPEG. During fiscal 2004, we announced availability of DesignWare PCI Express physical layer IP core, enabling lower cost ICs. We also acquired Accelerant Networks, Inc., giving our customers access to SERDES technology and additional connectivity IP solutions. Finally, during the year we acquired Cascade Semiconductor Solutions, Inc., adding their root-and-switch port IP. As a result, we believe we offer the industry's most complete PCI Express portfolio.

Combined, these advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of lower cost, higher performance computers, wireless communications networks, hand held devices, internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as Synopsys. These technological challenges have been accompanied by unprecedented business challenges stemming from the semiconductor downturn in 2000-2002, increased globalization leading customers to source their products in lower cost areas, and consumer demand for cheaper and more advanced products. The IC Design Process EDA software enables designers to create complex semiconductors. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of the steps described below. System Design. In system design, the designer describes the chip's desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized high-level computer language, typically C++ or System C. This phase yields a relatively high level behavioral model of the chip. Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design. RTL design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high level computer language, typically Verilog or VHDL. Logic Design. Logic design, or ""synthesis,"" programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of the chip, and produce a data file known as a netlist describing the various groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip. Functional Verification. At the RTL level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools such as RTL simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to verify that the design will function as intended. The increasing size and complexity of today's ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to 70% of total design time. As a result, designers are demanding solutions that can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds, and that can reduce verification risk (i.e., find design bugs before designs are taken into production). Physical Design. In the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with ""place and route"" products. The designer first 2 determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within each block, a process known as ""placement."" In many designs, placement is performed in conjunction with logic synthesis, a process known as ""physical synthesis."" After placement the designer adds the connections between the transistors, a process known as ""routing."" With increasing gate counts and design complexity, seamless correlation among physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important. Physical Verification. Before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer must perform a series of further verification steps, checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip. Design for Manufacturing. The design is then translated to a series of photomasks, or physical representations of the design. IC manufacturers use photomasks to produce the silicon wafer containing individual ICs. As IC wire or ""feature"" sizes shrink, this translation is becoming more and more difficult. These challenges are exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process, requiring advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced. Technology computer-aided design, or TCAD, tools are also used to model individual features or ""devices"" within the design to help ensure manufacturability. Finally, various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this stage to increase the number of usable ICs contained on each silicon wafer. Intellectual Property Reuse. As IC designs continue to grow in size and complexity, designers have found that inserting pre-designed and pre-verified design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified. Usually, such IP blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ICs, including microprocessors, digital signal processors, or connectivity IP that support such protocols as USB, PCI Express or Ethernet. Strategy With increasing chip complexity, designers are finding it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above sequentially, and must repeat some steps, such as verification, multiple times before finishing the design. Each such iteration can add significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet time-to-market goals. Synopsys addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product platforms, enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as the design moves from one step to the next. In addition, smaller and smaller chip feature sizes require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the production process than ever before. Synopsys has invested heavily in design for manufacturing tools and technologies that help ensure designs are still able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an acceptable yield. Also, many hardware products contain increasingly complex embedded software components that must be developed after the chip is designed. We offer system-level products that permit designers to develop such software earlier in the IC design process, speeding overall development time. Finally, designers are under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition. We address this issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality, pre-verified standards-based and other IP, which designers can use to complete their design faster and with greater confidence. 3 Products and Services Our products and services are managed by our six principal business groups: the Implementation, Verification, Silicon Engineering, Analog/Mixed-Signal, Systems and IP and Global Technical Services groups.

The Role of EDA in the Electronics Industry Technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density, speed, power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors (also referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips). •Since the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the widths of the wires imprinted on the chips that form the transistors) and other developments have enabled IC manufacturers to follow ""Moore's law,"" approximately doubling every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip. •Chips have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more powerful handheld devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, music players and personal digital assistants. •Increasingly, single SoCs can handle functions formerly performed by multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board. Combined, these advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of lower-cost, higher-performance computers, wireless communications networks, hand held devices, internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as Synopsys. These technological challenges have been accompanied by significant business challenges, increased globalization leading customers to source their products in lower cost areas, and consumer demand for cheaper and more advanced products. We believe Synopsys is well positioned to help our customers meet these multi-faceted challenges. We have a broad portfolio of solutions that are highly integrated to solve our customers' most advanced technological problems. We have a large number of global service and support engineers that help our customers complete their chip designs. We believe our combination of advanced technology and global scale, along with our solid business execution, gives us a competitive advantage. The IC Design Process EDA software enables designers to create complex semiconductors. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of the steps described below. System Design. The first step in a typical IC Design is determining the features and specifications of the chip, its overall architecture, and the division of device functionality between hardware and software. Once the architecture is created and the division between hardware and software made, software engineers develop the embedded software applications that drive an increasing proportion of the device functionality, while the chip designers develop the functionality and configuration of the semiconductor itself. Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design. RTL design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high level computer language, typically SystemVerilog, Verilog or VHDL. 2 Table of Contents Logic Design. Logic design, or ""synthesis,"" programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of the chip, and produce a data file known as a netlist describing the various groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip. Functional Verification. At the RTL level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools such as RTL simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to verify that the design will function as intended. The increasing size and complexity of today's ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to 70% of total design time. As a result, designers are demanding solutions that can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds, and that can reduce verification risk (i.e., find design bugs before designs are taken into production). Rapid Prototyping. Rapid prototyping is a form of functional verification that uses hardware to accelerate verification in order to accommodate these significant demands. It is also used to accelerate the development of embedded software by software engineers by essentially providing a ""prototype"" of the chip well before the chip is completed—allowing software development to begin many months earlier than would otherwise be the case. Physical Design. In the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with ""place and route"" products. The designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within each block, a process known as ""placement."" In many designs, placement is performed in conjunction with logic synthesis, a process known as ""physical synthesis."" After placement the designer adds the connections between the transistors, a process known as ""routing."" With increasing gate counts and design complexity, seamless correlation among physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important. Physical Verification. Before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer must perform a series of further verification steps, checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip. Manufacturing. The design is then translated to a series of photomasks, or physical representations of the design. IC manufacturers use photomasks to produce the silicon wafer containing individual ICs. As IC wire or ""feature"" sizes shrink, this translation is becoming more and more difficult. These challenges are exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process, requiring advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced. Technology computer-aided design, or TCAD, tools are also used to model individual features or ""devices"" within the design to help ensure manufacturability. Finally, various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this stage to increase the number of usable ICs contained on each silicon wafer. Intellectual Property Reuse. As IC designs continue to grow in size and complexity, designers have found that inserting pre-designed and pre-verified design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified. Usually, such IP blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ICs, including microprocessors, digital signal processors, or connectivity IP that support such protocols as USB, PCI Express or Ethernet. Strategy With increasing chip complexity, designers are finding it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above sequentially, and must repeat some steps, such as verification, multiple 3 Table of Contents times before finishing the design. Each such iteration can add significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet time-to-market goals. Synopsys addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product platforms, enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as the design moves from one step to the next. In addition, smaller and smaller chip feature sizes require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the production process than ever before. Synopsys has invested heavily in manufacturing-related technologies that help ensure designs are still able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an acceptable yield. Also, many hardware products contain increasingly complex embedded software components that must be developed after the chip is designed. We offer system-level products that permit designers to develop such software earlier in the IC design process, speeding overall development time. In addition, designers are under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition. We address this issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality, pre-verified standards-based and other IP, which designers can use to complete their design faster and with greater confidence. Finally, designers rely on assistance from EDA engineers to help them complete their chips on time and with high quality. We help customers with both design services and application engineer support. Our strategy is to help our customers get their products to market quickly and efficiently. In order to remain at the leading edge of technology development, we believe it is important to continually invest in research and development, as well as targeted acquisitions. We also believe that offering customer support on a global basis is instrumental to addressing our customers' needs.

The IC Design Process EDA software enables designers to create complex semiconductors. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of the steps described below. System Design. In system design, the designer describes the chip’s desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized high-level computer language, typically C++ or System C. This phase yields a relatively high level behavioral model of the chip. Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design.

The contents of our website are not part of this Form 10-K. 1 The Role of EDA in the Electronics Industry Technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily increased the feature density, speed, power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors (also referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips). · Since the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the widths of the wires imprinted on the chip that form the transistors) and other developments have enabled IC manufacturers to follow “Moore’s law,” approximately doubling every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip. · Chips have become more power efficient to address demand for smaller and more powerful handheld devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, music players and personal digital assistants. · Increasingly, single Systems-on-a-Chip (SoCs) can handle functions formerly performed by multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board. Combined, these advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of lower cost, higher performance computers, wireless communications networks, hand held devices, internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as Synopsys. These technological challenges have been accompanied by unprecedented business challenges stemming from the semiconductor downturn in 2000-2002, increased globalization leading customers to source their products in lower cost areas, and consumer demand for cheaper and more advanced products. The IC Design Process EDA software enables designers to create complex semiconductors. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of the steps described below. System Design. In system design, the designer describes the chip’s desired functions in very basic terms using a specialized high-level computer language, typically C++ or System C. This phase yields a relatively high level behavioral model of the chip. Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design. RTL design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high level computer language, typically Verilog or VHDL. Logic Design. Logic design, or “synthesis,” programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of the chip, and produce a data file known as a netlist describing the various groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip. Functional Verification. At the RTL level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools such as RTL simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to verify that the design will function as intended. The increasing size and complexity of today’s ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to 70% of total design time. As a result, designers are demanding solutions that can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds, and that can reduce verification risk (i.e., find design bugs before designs are taken into production). Physical Design. In the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with “place and route” products. The designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within each block, a process known as “placement.” In many designs, placement is performed in 2 conjunction with logic synthesis, a process known as “physical synthesis.” After placement the designer adds the connections between the transistors, a process known as “routing.” With increasing gate counts and design complexity, seamless correlation among physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important. Physical Verification. Before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer must perform a series of further verification steps, checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip. Design for Manufacturing. The design is then translated to a series of photomasks, or physical representations of the design. IC manufacturers use photomasks to produce the silicon wafer containing individual ICs. As IC wire or “feature” sizes shrink, this translation is becoming more and more difficult. These challenges are exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process, requiring advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced. Technology computer-aided design, or TCAD, tools are also used to model individual features or “devices” within the design to help ensure manufacturability. Finally, various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this stage to increase the number of usable ICs contained on each silicon wafer. Intellectual Property Reuse. As IC designs continue to grow in size and complexity, designers have found that inserting pre-designed and pre-verified design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified. Usually, such IP blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ICs, including microprocessors, digital signal processors, or connectivity IP that support such protocols as USB, PCI Express or Ethernet. Strategy With increasing chip complexity, designers are finding it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above sequentially, and must repeat some steps, such as verification, multiple times before finishing the design. Each such iteration can add significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet time-to-market goals. Synopsys addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product platforms, enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as the design moves from one step to the next. In addition, smaller and smaller chip feature sizes require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the production process than ever before. Synopsys has invested heavily in design for manufacturing tools and technologies that help ensure designs are still able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an acceptable yield. Also, many hardware products contain increasingly complex embedded software components that must be developed after the chip is designed. We offer system-level products that permit designers to develop such software earlier in the IC design process, speeding overall development time. Finally, designers are under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition. We address this issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality, pre-verified standards-based and other IP, which designers can use to complete their design faster and with greater confidence.

The Role of EDA in the Electronics Industry Technology advances in the semiconductor industry have steadily improved the feature density, speed, power efficiency and functional capacity of semiconductors (also referred to as integrated circuits, ICs or chips). • Since the early 1960s, steadily decreasing feature widths (the minimum widths of the features imprinted on the chips that form the wires and transistors) and other developments have enabled IC manufacturers to follow “Moore’s law,” approximately doubling every two years the number of transistors that can be placed on a chip. • This increase in transistor count enables SoCs to handle functions formerly performed by multiple ICs attached to a printed circuit board. • At the same time, transistors have become more power-efficient to address demand for more powerful battery-powered devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, music players and personal digital assistants. Combined, these advances in semiconductor technology have enabled the development of lower-cost, higher-performance computers, wireless communications networks, hand held devices, internet routers and a wealth of other electronic devices. Each advance, however, has introduced new challenges for all participants in semiconductor production, from designers and manufacturers to equipment manufacturers and EDA software suppliers, such as Synopsys. These technological challenges have been accompanied by significant business challenges, increased globalization leading customers to source their products in lower-cost areas, and consumer demand for cheaper and more advanced products. We believe Synopsys is well positioned to help our customers meet these multi-faceted challenges. We have a broad portfolio of solutions that are highly integrated to solve our customers’ most advanced technological problems. We have a large number of global service and support engineers that help our customers complete their chip designs. We believe our combination of advanced technology and global scale, along with our solid business execution, gives us a competitive advantage. The IC Design Process EDA software enables designers to create complex semiconductors. In simplified form, the IC design process consists of the steps described below. System Design. The first step in a typical IC Design is determining the features and specifications of the chip, its overall architecture, and the division of device functionality between hardware and software. Once the architecture is created and the division between hardware and software made, software engineers develop the embedded software applications that drive an increasing proportion of the device functionality, while the chip designers develop the functionality and configuration of the semiconductor itself. Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design. RTL design is the process of capturing the intended design functionality created at the system level using a specialized high level computer language, typically SystemVerilog, Verilog or VHDL. 2 Table of Contents Logic Design. Logic design, or “synthesis,” programs convert the RTL code into a logical diagram of the chip, and produce a data file known as a netlist describing the various groups of transistors, or gates, to be built on the chip. Functional Verification. At the RTL level of IC design, the designer uses functional verification tools such as RTL simulators and testbench automation and other verification tools to verify that the design will function as intended. The increasing size and complexity of today’s ICs and SoCs have vastly increased the time and effort required to verify chip designs, with verification estimated to consume 60% to 70% of total design time. As a result, designers are demanding solutions that can handle increasing complexity at ever higher speeds, and that can reduce verification risk (i.e., find design bugs before designs are taken into production). Rapid Prototyping. Rapid prototyping is a form of functional verification that uses hardware to accelerate verification in order to accommodate these significant demands. It is also used to accelerate the development of embedded software by software engineers by essentially providing a “prototype” of the chip well before the chip is completed—allowing software development to begin many months earlier than would otherwise be the case. Physical Design. In the physical design stage, the designer plans the physical location of all of the transistors and each of the wires connecting them with “place and route” products. The designer first determines the location on the chip die for each block of the chip, as well as the location for each transistor within each block, a process known as “placement.” In many designs, placement is performed in conjunction with logic synthesis, a process known as “physical synthesis.” After placement the designer adds the connections between the transistors, a process known as “routing.” With increasing gate counts and design complexity, seamless correlation among physical design and other tools is becoming increasingly important. Physical Verification. Before sending the chip design files to a manufacturer for fabrication, the designer must perform a series of further verification steps, checking to make sure that the final design complies with the specific requirements of the fabrication facility that will manufacture the chip. Manufacturing. The design is then translated to a series of photomasks, or physical representations of the design. IC manufacturers use photomasks to produce the silicon wafer containing individual ICs. As IC wire or “feature” sizes shrink, this translation is becoming more and more difficult. These challenges are exacerbated because in advanced designs the feature widths can be smaller than the wavelength of the light used in the manufacturing process, requiring advanced software tools and techniques such as optical proximity correction to alter the mask to ensure the desired features can still be produced. Technology computer-aided design, or TCAD, tools are also used to model individual features or “devices” within the design to help ensure manufacturability. Finally, various yield enhancement tools and technologies are employed at this stage to increase the number of usable ICs contained on each silicon wafer. Intellectual Property Reuse. As IC designs continue to grow in size and complexity, designers have found that inserting pre-designed and pre-verified design blocks into the design can be an effective way to help reduce overall design cost and cycle time by reducing the number of chip elements that must be designed and comprehensively verified. Usually, such IP blocks represent functions that can be used in multiple applications and ICs, including microprocessors, digital signal processors, or connectivity IP that support such protocols as USB, PCI Express or Ethernet. Strategy With increasing chip complexity, designers are finding it more and more difficult to complete each of the steps described above sequentially, and must repeat some steps, such as verification, multiple times before finishing the design. Each such iteration can add significant costs and makes it more difficult for the designer to meet time-to-market goals. Synopsys addresses these difficulties by integrating our point tools into product platforms, enabling significantly improved correlation and interoperability as the design moves from one step to the next. 3 Table of Contents In addition, smaller and smaller chip feature sizes require designers to take manufacturing issues into account earlier in the production process than ever before. Synopsys has invested heavily in manufacturing-related technologies that help ensure designs are still able to be manufactured after delivery to the fabrication facility at an acceptable yield. Also, many hardware products contain increasingly complex embedded software components that must be developed after the chip is designed. We offer system-level products that permit designers to develop such software earlier in the IC design process, speeding overall development time. In addition, designers are under increasing pressure to release their products commercially more quickly than ever before as a result of accelerating global competition. We address this issue by making available a large portfolio of high quality, pre-verified standards-based and other IP, which designers can use to complete their design faster and with greater confidence. Finally, designers rely on assistance from EDA engineers to help them complete their chips on time and with high quality. We help customers with both design services and application engineer support. Our strategy is to help our customers get their products to market quickly and efficiently. In order to remain at the leading edge of technology development, we believe it is important to continually invest in research and development, as well as targeted acquisitions. We also believe that offering customer support on a global basis is instrumental to addressing our customers’ needs. Products and Services Our products and services are divided into five common groupings: Galaxy™ Design Platform and Discovery™ Verification Platform (which are typically sold and reported together as Core EDA), Intellectual Property (IP) and System-Level Solutions, Manufacturing Solutions, and Professional Services. Galaxy Design Platform Our Galaxy Design Platform provides our customers with a single, integrated IC design solution which includes industry-leading individual products and which incorporates common libraries and consistent timing, delay calculation and constraints throughout the design process.

Customers who purchase term licenses and perpetual licenses may purchase these services separately. See Product Sales and Licensing Agreements below. Software maintenance services include minor product enhancements, bug fixes and access to our technical support center for primary support. Software maintenance also includes access to SolvNet, our web-based support solution that gives customers access to Synopsys’ complete design knowledge database. Updated daily, SolvNet includes documentation, design tips and answers to user questions. Customers can also engage, for additional charges, our worldwide network of applications consultants for additional support needs. In addition, Synopsys also offers training workshops designed to increase customer design proficiency and productivity with our products. Workshops cover Synopsys products and methodologies used in our design and verification flows, as well as specialized modules addressing system design, logic design, physical design, simulation and test. We offer regularly scheduled public and private courses in a variety of locations worldwide, as well as Virtual Classroom on-demand and live online training. Product Warranties We generally warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days for our software products and for up to one year for our hardware products. We also typically provide our customers limited indemnities with respect to claims that their use of our design 5 Table of Contents and verification software products infringe on United States patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets. We have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date, although we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a Japanese electronics company. Support for Industry Standards We actively create and support standards that help our customers increase productivity, facilitate efficient design flows, improve interoperability of tools from different vendors, and ensure connectivity, functionality and interoperability of IP building blocks. Standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations, from industry consortia, by company licensing made available to all, from de facto usage, or through open source licensing. Synopsys’ products support more than 60 standards, including the most commonly used hardware description languages: SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL, and SystemC. Our products utilize numerous industry standard data formats, application programming interfaces, and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools, other EDA vendors’ products, and applications that customers develop internally. We also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our IP product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity. Sales, Distribution and Backlog We market our products and services primarily through direct sales in the United States and principal foreign markets. We typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically, but provide physical media (i.e., CD-ROMs) when requested by the customer. We maintain sales/support centers throughout the United States. Outside the United States, we maintain sales, support or service offices in Canada, multiple countries in Europe, Israel, Japan, and other countries in Asia. Our foreign headquarters is located in Dublin, Ireland. Our offices are further described under Part I, Item 2, Properties. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, an aggregate of 51%, 50% and 50%, respectively, of Synopsys’ total revenue was derived from sales outside of the United States. Additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations, including revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area, is contained in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,",2023-12-30 20:30:13.675243

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements. Business Summary Synopsys is a world leader in providing technology solutions used to develop electronics and electronic systems. We supply the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design, create prototypes for and test integrated circuits, also known as chips. We also supply software and hardware used to develop the systems that incorporate integrated circuits and the software that runs on those integrated circuits. Our intellectual property (IP) products are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than redesigning those circuits themselves. To complement these product offerings, we provide technical services to support our solutions and we help our customers develop chips and electronic systems. Our customers are generally large semiconductor and electronics manufacturers. Our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while 24 Table of Contents reducing their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be impacted by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. Despite recent global economic uncertainty, we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technology and strong customer relationships, but also because of our recurring revenue business model. Under this model, a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this recurring revenue over the life of the contract, which averages approximately three years. Recurring revenue generally represents more than 90% of our total revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. We typically enter each quarter with greater than 90% of our revenue for that particular quarter already committed from our customers, providing for stability and predictability of results. Due to our business model, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way. The semiconductor industry has experienced modest growth to date in 2011 and continued modest growth is currently anticipated for 2012. Our semiconductor customers remain cautious and focused on their costs due to the cyclical nature of the industry, the increasing complexity of product development and macroeconomic factors. The continued instability of global markets may intensify an already challenging environment for our customers to plan investment in research and development. Nevertheless, our business outlook is positive based on growth forecasts for the semiconductor industry and our strong financials, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy. Through our recent acquisitions, we have enhanced our technology and expanded our product portfolio and our total addressable market, especially in IP and system-level solutions, which we believe will help drive revenue growth. We expect to explore both organic and inorganic growth opportunities, including acquiring companies or technology that can contribute to the strategic, operational and financial performance of our business. We will continue to monitor worldwide economic growth rates, the considerable volatility of current global markets and other macroeconomic factors and may make adjustments to our business in the event that the semiconductor industry is unable to maintain current spending levels for our solutions. We believe that the combination of our solid financials, leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us successfully execute our strategies. Fiscal Year End Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest October 31. Fiscal 2011 ended on October 29, 2011, fiscal 2010 ended on October 30, 2010 and fiscal 2009 ended on October 31, 2009. For presentation purposes in this Form 10-K, we refer to October 31 as the end of a fiscal year. Fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were 52-week fiscal years. Fiscal 2012 will be a 53-week fiscal year, which will impact our revenue, expenses and operating results. Fiscal 2011 Financial Performance Summary • We continued to derive more than 90% of our revenue from time-based licenses, maintenance and services. • Our total revenue of $1,535.6 million increased by $154.9 million, or 11%, from $1,380.7 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was attributable to our overall growth, including sales of products associated with our prior-year acquisitions, which resulted in increased time-based license revenue, upfront license revenue and professional services revenue. • Our cost of revenue and operating expenses increased compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to increases in employee-related costs driven by increased headcount and other direct costs from our prior-year acquisitions. 25 Table of Contents • Our income before provision for income taxes of $219.1 million increased by $20.4 million, or 10%, from $198.7 million in fiscal 2010 primarily due to overall growth. • In fiscal 2011, we had lower tax benefits than we had in fiscal 2010, which was the primary cause of our year-over-year total net income decline from $237.1 million in fiscal 2010 to $221.4 million in fiscal 2011. • Our net cash flow from operating activities of $440.3 million increased by $99.3 million, or 29%, from $341.0 million in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily from increased customer collections due to our volume of contracts and the timing of billings to customers. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading “Results of Operations” below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and net income. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are: • Revenue recognition; • Valuation of stock compensation; • Valuation of intangible assets; and • Income taxes. Revenue Recognition Software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees. Hardware revenue consists of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board-based products. With respect to software licenses, we utilize three license types: • Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs). TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. We bundle and do not charge separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for the term of the license. • Term licenses. Term licenses are also for a finite term, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee. • Perpetual licenses. Perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. 26 Table of Contents For the three software license types, we recognize revenue as follows: • TSLs. We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. • Term licenses. We recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer payments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. • Perpetual licenses. We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. We also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events, for example, royalty arrangements. We refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue.” Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs. Such revenue is reported as “time-based revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Historically, these arrangements have not been material to our total revenue. We recognize revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these hardware sales is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Hardware sales have not been material to our total revenue. We infrequently enter into multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software deliverables such as hardware. On a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we applied recently issued accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables for these contracts. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, is not expected to have a material effect on subsequent periods and did not affect the accounting for contracts which do not contain non-software deliverables. The recent accounting guidance addresses whether to treat individual deliverables or groups of deliverables in a multiple-element arrangement as separate units of accounting and how to allocate the arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting. The guidance also requires that arrangement consideration be allocated to software deliverables (as a group) and to non-software deliverables (individually) based on relative standalone selling prices and provides guidance for estimating standalone selling prices for purposes of allocating arrangement consideration. We have determined that the software and non-software deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting. Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2011, all deliverables in our contracts were considered one unit of accounting unless we had vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value for all undelivered elements. We now allocate arrangement consideration to separate units of 27 Table of Contents accounting based on estimated standalone selling prices (ESP) because we do not have objective evidence of standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling prices of our separate units of accounting considering both market conditions and our own specific conditions. For hardware deliverables, we determine ESP using gross margin because we have consistent pricing practices and gross margins for these products. Determining the ESP for software deliverables requires significant judgment. We determine ESP for software deliverables after considering customer geographies, market demand and competition at the time of contract negotiation, gross margin objectives, existing portfolio pricing practices, contractually stated prices and prices for similar historical transactions. Under the recent accounting guidance we recognize revenue for our separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon delivery when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized according to the methods described above depending on the software license type (TSL, term license or perpetual license). We recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable, and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. We also enter into arrangements to deliver software products, either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification, or customization of the software. We account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues and costs. We measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project. Revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that contain only software and software related deliverables based on VSOE. We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer. We recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, since there is not sufficient VSOE to allocate the TSL fee between license and maintenance services. We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows: • Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and by us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement. 28 Table of Contents • Delivery Has Occurred. We deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer’s hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically FOB shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter. • The Fee is Fixed or Determinable. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75% or more of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers’ installments become due and payable. • Collectability is Probable. We judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received. Valuation of Stock Compensation Stock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. We estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards. We determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards. We calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends. These input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment. If a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs. Any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter. Valuation of Intangible Assets We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of 29 Table of Contents purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer-relationships, trademarks and trade names, covenants not to compete, capitalized software development and other intangibles. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. Income Taxes Our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse, and for tax loss and credit carryovers. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately $338.8 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2011 will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made. We apply a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws. We are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, we would record an additional charge to earnings. Results of Operations Revenue Background We generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses, maintenance and professional services and to a small extent, hardware products. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses, services and hardware products at varying times. In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order over the 30 Table of Contents license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered. Substantially all of our current time-based licenses are TSLs with an average license term of approximately three years. Revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development. Revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped. Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs. Revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year). Revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized after services are performed and accepted by the customer. Our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time-based license, upfront license, maintenance and professional services and hardware revenue for the period. We derive time-based license revenue in any quarter largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements. We derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter. We derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted, not when they are booked. Our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters. Conversely, perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generate current quarter revenue but no future revenue (e.g., a $120,000 order for a perpetual license generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered, but no future revenue). Additionally, revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fees and 100% of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable. Our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive EDA market. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes. Total Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) $1,535.6 $ 1,380.7 $ 1,360.0 $ 154.9 11 % $ 20.7 2 % Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms, the timing and value of contract renewals and the sale of products associated with prior-year acquisitions. The sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2011 was due to our overall growth, which was benefited by acquisitions, and the related increase in time-based revenue, 31 Table of Contents upfront revenue and professional services revenue primarily driven by the timing and value of contract renewals, sales of products and professional services contracts including contracts assumed from our prior-year acquisitions. Time-Based License Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) $ 1,260.3 $ 1,158.4 $ 1,150.5 $ 101.9 9 % $ 7.9 1 % Percentage of total revenue 82 % 84 % 85 % The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to increases in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, higher contingent revenue from royalties and product sales from prior-year acquisitions. The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the increase in contingent revenue from royalties received and recognized in fiscal 2010. Upfront License Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) $ 90.5 $ 68.6 $ 57.5 $ 21.9 32 % $ 11.1 19 % Percentage of total revenue 6 % 5 % 4 % Changes in upfront license revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period. The increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products, perpetual licenses and products associated with prior-year acquisitions. The increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to higher customer demand in hardware and IP perpetual license requirements. Maintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) Maintenance revenue $ 77.6 $ 78.1 $ 85.3 $ (0.5 ) (1 )% $ (7.2 ) (8 )% Professional service and other revenue 107.2 75.5 66.7 31.7 42 % 8.8 13 % Total $ 184.8 $ 153.6 $ 152.0 $ 31.2 20 % $ 1.6 1 % Percentage of total revenue 12 % 11 % 11 % Changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing of renewals and the type of contracts renewed on maintenance contracts. Maintenance revenue was relatively flat for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and decreased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Professional services and other revenue increased substantially in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to professional services contracts assumed from prior acquisitions. 32 Table of Contents Professional services and other revenue increased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to an increase in recognition of professional services from customer contracts acquired through acquisition offset by a decrease in consulting contracts completed in fiscal 2010. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue $ 340.5 $ 281.1 $ 273.7 $ 59.4 21 % $ 7.4 3 % Operating expenses 982.4 915.5 878.1 66.9 7 % 37.4 4 % Total $ 1,322.9 $ 1,196.6 $ 1,151.8 $ 126.3 11 % $ 44.8 4 % Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue 86 % 87 % 85 % Our expenses are generally impacted by changes in employee related costs including salaries, benefits, stock compensation and variable compensation, changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses. The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and due to an increase in commission expense driven by higher shipments. Furthermore, beginning in fiscal 2010, acquisition-related costs such as severance, contract terminations, professional service fees and other directly related costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred as required by revised accounting standards. Prior to fiscal 2010, such costs were recorded as purchase consideration. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool. Consequently, fluctuations in these drivers impact the amounts allocated to each functional area. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs. Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) Cost of license revenue $ 205.5 $ 180.2 $ 175.6 $ 25.3 14 % $ 4.6 3 % Cost of maintenance and service revenue 80.2 64.8 65.4 15.4 24 % (0.6 ) (1 )% Amortization of intangible assets 54.8 36.1 32.7 18.7 52 % 3.4 10 % Total $ 340.5 $ 281.1 $ 273.7 $ 59.4 21 % $ 7.4 3 % Percentage of total revenue 22 % 20 % 20 % We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of license revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions 33 Table of Contents providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported. Cost of license revenue. Cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products which have reached technological feasibility. Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to provide our professional consulting services, and costs associated with the delivery of services, such as production and customization services, hotline and on-site support, and documentation of maintenance updates. Amortization of intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortized to cost of revenue and operating expenses, and include the contract rights associated with certain contracts and core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions. Cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in professional service revenue. The increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in $16.9 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases from our prior-year acquisitions, an increase of $18.9 million in costs to provide maintenance and professional services, an increase of $2.3 million in hardware and license costs, and an increase of $18.7 million for amortization of intangible assets due to our prior-year acquisitions. Cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 20% for fiscal years 2010 and 2009. The increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an increase of $3.4 million in intangibles amortization primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions, an increase of $1.1 million in travel related costs, an increase of $1.1 million in other direct costs and an increase of $1.6 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described. Operating Expenses Research and Development Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) $ 491.9 $ 449.2 $ 419.9 $ 42.7 10 % $ 29.3 7 % Percentage of total revenue 32 % 33 % 31 % The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase of $31.8 million in personnel-related costs and an increase of $11.9 million in functionally allocated expenses as a result of headcount increases from our prior-year acquisitions. The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an increase of $7.9 million in personnel related costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions, $7.8 million in acquisition-related costs, an increase of $2.4 million in stock compensation expense, an increase of $3.9 million in other research and development expenses, and an increase of $8.6 million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in depreciation expense. 34 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) $ 363.1 $ 339.8 $ 324.1 $ 23.3 7 % $ 15.7 5 % Percentage of total revenue 24 % 25 % 24 % Changes in commissions and other variable compensation are generally attributable to the volume of contracts and timing of shipments based on contract requirements. The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase of $10.6 million in commissions and other variable compensation, an increase of $9.6 million in other employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount from prior-year acquisitions, and an increase of $2.7 million in travel-related costs. The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to an increase of $18.9 million in commissions, other variable compensation and employee related costs, an increase of $3.4 million in acquisition-related costs and an increase of $1.1 million in travel related costs. The increase in commissions and other variable compensation was primarily driven by higher shipments during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $8.0 million of other sales and marketing expense, including consulting, marketing and communications. General and Administrative Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) $ 112.8 $ 114.9 $ 119.1 $ (2.1 ) (2 )% $ (4.2 ) (4 )% Percentage of total revenue 7 % 8 % 9 % The decrease in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a decrease of $13.8 million resulting from higher allocation of expenses to other functional areas because of increased headcount. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.3 million in personnel-related costs, $6.1 million in facility expenses and $2.9 million in other general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of our prior-year acquisitions. The decrease in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a reduction of $3.4 million in bad debt expense based on our review of customer receivables, a decrease of $7.9 million resulting from higher allocation of expenses to other functional areas as previously described, and a decrease in expense due to a $4.5 million restructuring charge related to a facility closure recorded in fiscal 2009. These decreases were offset by an increase of $9.3 million in acquisition-related costs and an increase of $3.0 million in facilities expense primarily due to our acquisitions. Change in Fair Value of Deferred Compensation The income or loss arising from the change in fair value of the non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. The overall net impact to our consolidated statements of operations from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset is immaterial for all periods presented. 35 Table of Contents Acquired In-Process Research and Development In-process research and development (IPR&D) costs relate to in-process technologies acquired in acquisitions. The value assigned to IPR&D is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology, the successful development of the IPR&D, its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which are unknown at the time of determination. Effective for fiscal 2010, upon adoption of accounting guidance, ASC 805, Business Combinations, acquired IPR&D were capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and is assessed for impairment in subsequent periods. Upon completion of development, the underlying intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue. Prior to the adoption, IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition if it had no alternative future use. IPR&D expense was $2.2 million for fiscal 2009. IPR&D projects acquired in fiscal 2010 are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition. IPR&D projects of $14.1 million were completed during fiscal 2011. See Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete, and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in current and prior years. Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) Included in cost of revenue $ 54.8 $ 36.1 $ 32.7 $ 18.7 52 % $ 3.4 10 % Included in operating expenses 14.6 11.6 12.8 3.0 26 % (1.2 ) (9 )% Total $ 69.4 $ 47.7 $ 45.5 $ 21.7 45 % $ 2.2 5 % Percentage of total revenue 5 % 3 % 3 % Amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table as it is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. The increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a full year’s amortization of intangible assets acquired from our prior-year acquisitions offset by certain other intangible assets acquired in prior years becoming fully amortized. The increase in amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to addition of intangible assets from our acquisitions in fiscal 2010 offset by certain other intangible assets acquired in prior years becoming fully amortized. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts which information is included herein. Impairment of Intangible Assets. We did not record any impairment charges to the intangible assets during fiscal 2011, 2010, or 2009. 36 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ 2.1 $ 5.4 $ 10.8 $ (3.3 ) (61 )% $ (5.4 ) (50 )% (Loss) gain on investments $ (0.0 ) $ 3.8 (6.4 ) (3.8 ) (100 )% 10.2 (159 )% Gain (loss) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan 2.4 8.8 10.0 (6.4 ) (73 )% (1.2 ) (12 )% Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) 1.7 (1.5 ) 7.1 3.2 (213 )% (8.6 ) (121 )% Other, net 0.1 (2.0 ) 3.3 2.1 (105 )% (5.3 ) (161 )% Total $ 6.3 $ 14.5 $ 24.8 $ (8.2 ) (57 )% $ (10.3 ) (42 )% The net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in gain on assets related to our deferred compensation plan, a decrease in gains on sale of investments and lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by foreign exchange fluctuations. The net decrease in other income (expense) in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations, and lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by an increase from gains on sales of investments. Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2011 and 2010 include one-time tax benefits of settlements with the IRS of $32.8 million (for fiscal years 2006 through 2009) in fiscal 2011 and $94.3 million (for fiscal years 2002 through 2004) in fiscal 2010. The effect of this change was partly offset by the benefit of the extension of the federal research credit in fiscal 2011, which resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2010 as well as a full year credit for fiscal 2011, compared to only two months in fiscal 2010. Without the impact of the IRS settlements, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 and 2010 would have been 13.9% and 28.2%, respectively. For further discussion of the provision for income taxes and the IRS settlement, see Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our sources of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility. As of October 31, 2011, we held an aggregate of $230.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the United States and an aggregate of $774.1 million in our foreign subsidiaries. Funds held in our foreign subsidiaries are generated from revenue outside North America. At present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. However, in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund cash needs in the United States and if U.S. taxes have not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds. 37 Table of Contents The following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2011. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 855.1 $ 775.4 $ 79.7 10 % Short-term investments 149.0 163.2 (14.2 ) (9 )% Total $ 1,004.1 $ 938.6 $ 65.5 7 % We generated strong cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2011. Our cash generated from operating activities was $440.3 million in fiscal 2011. Other cash activities were (1) share repurchases of $401.8 million and an equity forward contract purchased of $33.3 million partially offset by proceeds from issuances of common stock of $162.2 million, (2) purchases of property and equipment of $57.3 million, (3) payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $41.0 million, and (4) net proceeds from sales and purchases of short-term investments of $9.6 million. Cash flows Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2011 2010 2009 2010 to 2011 2009 to 2010 (dollars in millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 440.3 $ 341.0 $ 239.2 $ 99.3 29 % $ 101.8 43 % Cash used in investing activities (88.8 ) (238.7 ) (191.9 ) 149.9 (63 )% (46.8 ) (24 )% Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (277.6 ) (43.1 ) 69.5 (234.5 ) 544 % (112.6 ) (162 )% Cash provided by operating activities We expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from time-based license revenue. In contrast, payment terms for TSLs are generally extended and the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license. Fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. Cash from operating activities increased due to fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulting from increased accounts receivable collections due to timing of billings, offset partly by higher payments due to disbursements to vendors, higher variable compensation costs and higher personnel related costs due to increased headcount, as well as increased tax payments. Fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010. Cash from operating activities increased primarily as a result of increased cash received from customers due to timing of billings, lower bonuses, commissions, vendor payments and lower income tax payments due to an IRS settlement compared to fiscal 2009. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 38 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities Fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. The decrease in cash used primarily relates to lower cash payments for acquisitions in 2011 offset by lower net proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments and higher property and equipment purchases. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010. The increase in cash used primarily relates to the increase in acquisition activities during fiscal 2010 offset by the increase in net proceeds from sale and maturities of short-term investments. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash (used in) provided by financing activities Fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. The increase in cash used relates to common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) program, including cash paid for an equity forward contract as part of the ASR program, partially offset by higher proceeds from issuances of common stock. Fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010. The increase in cash used primarily related to the common stock repurchases resumed in fiscal 2010 offset by an increase in the number of options exercised by employees compared to fiscal 2009. Accounts Receivable, net Year Ended October 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) $203.1 $181.1 $22.0 12% Our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding (DSO) are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities. Our DSO was 47 days at October 31, 2011 and 44 days at October 31, 2010. DSO remained relatively flat primarily due to the high quality of our accounts receivable portfolio. Working Capital. Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets: Year Ended October 31, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets $ 1,338.1 $ 1,247.8 $ 90.3 7 % Current liabilities 1,008.8 921.8 87.0 9 % Working capital $ 329.3 $ 326.0 $ 3.3 1 % The primary drivers of changes in our working capital were: (1) a $103.0 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing of our billings and (2) a $14.9 million decrease in deferred tax asset balances based on normal provision calculation and completion of IRS audits. The decrease in working capital was partially offset by (1) a $65.5 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as explained above, (2) a $22.0 million increase in accounts receivable, net of allowances, as explained above, (3) a $12.4 million decrease in income taxes payable, net of income taxes receivable, based on normal provision calculation and completion of IRS audits, and (4) a $21.3 million increase attributable to movements in other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances, primarily related to movements in foreign exchange contract fair values, timing of payments of annual maintenance contracts and timing of payments made to vendors in the normal course of business. 39 Table of Contents Other Our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of October 31, 2011, consists of investment grade municipal securities, tax-exempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer. As of October 31, 2011, we had no direct holdings in structured investment vehicles, sub-prime mortgage-backed securities or collateralized debt obligations and no exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds. During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 we had no impairment charge associated with our short-term investment portfolio. While we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, we regularly review our investments and associated risk profiles, which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio. As a result of the challenging conditions in the financial markets, we proactively manage our cash and cash equivalents and investments balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents and fixed income portfolio invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding AA. After the recent downgrade of the U.S. long-term sovereign credit rating by Standard & Poor’s, our portfolio maintained its weighted average credit rating above AA. The majority of our investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. See Note 5 and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Commitments Credit Facility. On October 14, 2011, we entered into a five-year, $350.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans to us and our foreign subsidiaries. The facility replaces our previous $300.0 million senior unsecured facility, which was terminated effective October 14, 2011. The amount of the facility may be increased by up to an additional $150.0 million through the fourth year of the facility. The facility contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. The facility terminates on October 14, 2016. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of base rates as described in the credit facility. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.150% and 0.300% per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. As of October 31, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants. Pending Acquisition of Magma Design Automation. On November 30, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, have agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock of Magma in exchange for cash. The consummation of the acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including approval by Magma’s stockholders and regulatory approvals. Subject to the receipt of all required approvals, it is currently anticipated that the closing of the acquisition will occur around the end of the second calendar quarter of 2012. We have agreed to pay $7.35 per share for each outstanding share of Magma common stock for a total of approximately $507 million net of cash and debt acquired. In addition, we have agreed to assume certain unvested equity awards of Magma in exchange for equity awards of Synopsys. We expect to fund the acquisition using a combination of cash and debt. We may need to incur additional debt separate from the credit facility described above. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next twelve months. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 31, 2011.

(2) In October 2011, we agreed to lease two office buildings to be constructed in Mountain View, California. Once construction is complete, the buildings together will provide approximately 341,000 square feet. The buildings may be enlarged up to a total size of approximately 440,000 square feet by mutual agreement of Synopsys and the lessor. The lease of such premises begins upon the later of March 1, 2015 or six months after construction is substantially completed and expires approximately 15 years thereafter and can be extended for an additional 19 years after such initial expiration. We may terminate the lease by exercising a separate option to purchase the property (i) at any time prior to January 13, 2012 or (ii) if the lessor fails to obtain financing. We may also terminate the lease if, under certain circumstances, the lessor fails to commence construction by June 1, 2013 or substantially complete construction of the buildings by March 1, 2015. Additional information is provided in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2011. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. (4) Long term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2011. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments in individual years beyond fiscal 2011 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits. In connection with acquisitions completed prior to October 31, 2011, we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $2.1 million during fiscal 2012 and $2.2 million during fiscal 2013 if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved. Because these commitments are contingent on certain performance and milestone goals, these amounts are not reflected in the table above. The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of October 31, 2011, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 41 Table of Contents Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements For a description of the effect of new accounting pronouncements on Synopsys, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which information is included herein. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. None of these investments are held for trading purposes. Our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. The following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average total return for our investment portfolio as of October 31, 2011: Carrying Value Weighted AverageTotal Return (in thousands) Money market funds (U.S.) $ 55,267 0.020% Cash deposits and money market funds (International) 649,812 0.196% Short-term investments (U.S.) 148,997 0.109% Total interest bearing instruments $ 854,076 0.170% As of October 31, 2011, the stated maturities of our short-term investments are: Fair Value (in thousands) Due in 1 year or less $ 89,791 Due in 1–5 years 28,413 Due in 6–10 years 11,409 Due after 10 years 19,384 Total $ 148,997 Actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. These investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. Realized gains and losses on sales of short-term investments have not been material in any period presented.

We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of each of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency, except for our principal Irish, Hungarian, and Swiss subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are the U.S. dollar. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2011, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $12.0 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $12.0 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $12.0 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. Net unrealized loss of approximately $12.8 million and $6.4 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2011 and October 31, 2010, respectively. If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 43 Table of Contents The following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2011: Gross NotionalAmount inU.S. Dollars AverageContractRate (in thousands) Forward Contract Values: Japanese yen $ 204,536 78.52 Euro 120,268 0.722 Indian rupee 52,092 47.628 Chinese renminbi 49,743 6.391 Canadian dollar 42,956 0.998 Taiwan dollar 34,895 28.75 British pound sterling 22,994 0.629 Israeli shekel 16,133 3.504 Armenian dram 12,754 355.04 Swiss franc 10,249 0.815 Korean Won 9,672 1,079.92 Swedish krona 7,409 6.52 Hungarian forint 5,536 212.32 Singapore dollar 5,002 1.22 Australian dollar 2,729 0.956 Russian ruble 2,210 28.365 Polish zloty 666 3.173 $ 599,844 The following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of October 31, 2010: Gross NotionalAmount inU.S. Dollars AverageContractRate (in thousands) Forward Contract Values: Japanese yen $ 351,133 83.33 Euro 116,833 0.732 Indian rupee 39,899 46.25 Canadian dollar 38,666 1.03 Chinese renminbi 36,592 6.61 Taiwan dollar 28,008 30.73 British pound sterling 15,681 0.640 Armenian dram 14,150 351.20 Israeli shekel 13,357 3.63 Swiss franc 8,841 0.969 Swedish krona 7,422 6.65 Korean won 7,252 1,132.39 Hungarian forint 5,441 196.42 Singapore dollar 4,027 1.31 Australian dollar 3,084 1.04 Polish zloty 957 2.82 $ 691,343 44 Table of Contents Equity Risk.

883241,SNPS,SYNOPSYS INC,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements. Business Summary Synopsys is a global leader in providing software, intellectual property and services used to accelerate innovation in integrated circuits and electronic systems. We supply the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design, create prototypes for and test integrated circuits, also known as chips. We also supply software and hardware used to develop the systems that incorporate integrated circuits and the software that runs on those integrated circuits. Our intellectual property (IP) products are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than redesigning those circuits themselves. To complement these product offerings, we provide technical services to support our solutions and we help our customers develop chips and electronic systems. Our customers are generally large semiconductor and electronics manufacturers. Our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be impacted by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. Despite global economic uncertainty, we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technology and strong customer relationships, but also because of our recurring revenue business model. Under this model, a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this recurring revenue over the life of the contract, which averages approximately three years. Recurring revenue generally represents more than 90% of our total revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. We typically enter each quarter with greater than 90% of our revenue for that particular quarter already committed from our customers, providing for stability and predictability of results. Due to our business model, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way. Even with the continued instability of the global markets, our business outlook remains strong based on our business model, strong financials, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy. In addition, consumer demand for electronics has been solid, particularly the demand for mobile devices. Through our recent acquisitions, we have enhanced our technology and expanded our product portfolio and our total addressable market, especially in IP and system-level solutions, which we believe will help drive revenue growth. We believe that the combination of our solid financials, leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us to continue to successfully execute our strategies. Fiscal 2012 Acquisitions During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed our acquisition of Magma Design Automation, Inc. (Magma), and during the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of Emulation & 25 Table of Contents Verification Engineering S.A. (EVE) and acquired a controlling interest in SpringSoft, Inc. (SpringSoft). As further described below, these acquisitions, combined with other acquisitions in fiscal 2012, were the primary drivers for increases in revenues and expenses compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal Year End Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. When a 53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal 2012 was a 53-week year and ended on November 3, 2012. Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010 were 52-week years, ending on October 29, 2011 and October 30, 2010, respectively. The extra week in fiscal 2012 resulted in approximately $26 million of additional revenue, related primarily to time-based licenses, and approximately $16 million of additional expenses. For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to October 31 as the end of our fiscal year. Fiscal 2012 Financial Performance Summary Increases in our revenue and expenses were driven by the overall growth of our business, including from our acquisitions in fiscal 2012. In addition, the extra week in fiscal 2012 contributed to increases in our revenue and expenses. • We continued to derive more than 90% of our revenue from time-based licenses, maintenance and services. • Our total revenue, excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2012 that added $26 million, increased by $194.4 million primarily due to our general growth and acquisitions during fiscal 2012. • Total operating expense and cost of revenues, excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2012 that resulted in $16 million in expenses, increased by $227.2 million primarily due to employee-related costs as a result of an almost 20% higher headcount principally from acquisitions; higher amortization and depreciation expenses; and other expenses that are related solely to acquisitions and do not regularly reoccur in the operation of our business. • Income tax provisions for fiscal 2012 increased by $21.0 million. The increase was primarily due to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit after December 31, 2011 and a shift in the geographical mix of our earnings that resulted in a lower tax benefit from foreign earnings taxed below the U.S. statutory rate in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. • As a result of the increase in expenses due to our fiscal 2012 acquisitions, and increased taxes, our net income was lower by $39.0 million in fiscal 2012 compared to 2011. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading “Results of Operations” below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and net income. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are: • Revenue recognition; 26 Table of Contents • Valuation of stock compensation; • Valuation of intangible assets; and • Income taxes. Revenue Recognition Software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees. Hardware revenue consists of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board-based products. With respect to software licenses, we utilize three license types: • Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs). TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. We bundle and do not charge separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for the term of the license. • Term licenses. Term licenses are also for a finite term, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee. • Perpetual licenses. Perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. For the three software license types, we recognize revenue as follows: • TSLs. We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. • Term licenses. We recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as “upfront revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer payments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. • Perpetual licenses. We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. We also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events, for example, royalty arrangements. We refer to this revenue as “contingent 27 Table of Contents revenue.” Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs. Such revenue is reported as “time-based revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Historically, these arrangements have not been material to our total revenue. We recognize revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these hardware sales is reported as “upfront revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. Hardware sales have not been material to our total revenue. We infrequently enter into multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software deliverables such as hardware. On a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we applied accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to these contracts. Such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect on subsequent periods. We have determined that the software and non-software deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting. Accordingly, we allocate the arrangement consideration to separate units of accounting based on estimated standalone selling prices (ESP) because we do not have objective evidence of standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling prices of our separate units of accounting considering both market conditions and our own specific conditions. For hardware deliverables, we determine ESP using gross margin because we have consistent pricing practices and gross margins for these products. Determining the ESP for software deliverables requires significant judgment. We determine ESP for software deliverables after considering customer geographies, market demand and competition at the time of contract negotiation, gross margin objectives, existing portfolio pricing practices, contractually stated prices and prices for similar historical transactions. We recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized according to the methods described above depending on the software license type (TSL, term license or perpetual license). We recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable, and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. We also enter into arrangements to deliver software products, either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification, or customization of the software. We account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues and costs. We measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project. Revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that contain only software and software related deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognize revenue from professional services as 28 Table of Contents services are performed and accepted by the customer. We recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, since there is not sufficient VSOE to allocate the TSL fee between license and maintenance services. We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows: • Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and by us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement. • Delivery Has Occurred. We deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer’s hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically Freight on Board (FOB) shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter. • The Fee is Fixed or Determinable. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75% or more of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers’ installments become due and payable. • Collectability is Probable. We judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received. Valuation of Stock Compensation Stock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and risk-free 29 Table of Contents interest rates. We estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards. We determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards. We calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends. These input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment. If a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs. Any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter. Valuation of Intangible Assets We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer-relationships, trademarks and trade names, covenants not to compete, capitalized software development and other intangibles. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010. Income Taxes Our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse, and for tax loss and credit carryovers. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately $311.0 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2012 will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We apply a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 30 Table of Contents The calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws. We are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, we would record an additional charge to earnings. Results of Operations Revenue Background We generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses, maintenance and professional services and to a small extent, hardware products. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses, services and hardware products at varying times. In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered. The average license term of the TSLs and term licenses we entered into in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 was 2.7 years, 2.8 years and 2.9 years, respectively. Revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development. Revenue on hardware product orders are generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped. Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs. Revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year). Revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized after services are performed and accepted by the customer. Our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time-based license, upfront, maintenance and professional services and hardware revenue for the period. We derive time-based license revenue in any quarter largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements. We derive upfront revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter. We derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software, and not when they are booked. Our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters. Conversely, a $120,000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered, but no future revenue. Additionally, revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fees and 100% of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable. Our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on 31 Table of Contents all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive EDA market. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes. Total Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) $1,756.0 $ 1,535.6 $ 1,380.7 $ 220.4 14 % $ 154.9 11 % Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals. The sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012 was due to overall growth of our business including contributions of revenue from acquired companies. The increases were primarily in the time-based license revenue. Fiscal 2012 had approximately $26 million of additional revenue due to the additional week in the fiscal year. Time-Based License Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) $ 1,449.3 $ 1,260.3 $ 1,158.4 $ 189.0 15 % $ 101.9 9 % Percentage of total revenue 83 % 82 % 84 % The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to increases in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods and from the contracts acquired through fiscal 2012 acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, due to higher contingent revenue, product sales, the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2012 and other time-based arrangements. The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to increases in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, higher contingent revenue from royalties and product sales from prior-year acquisitions. Upfront Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) $ 105.1 $ 90.5 $ 68.6 $ 14.6 16 % $ 21.9 32 % Percentage of total revenue 6 % 6 % 5 % Changes in upfront revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period. The sequential increase in upfront revenue from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products and perpetual licenses. 32 Table of Contents Maintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) Maintenance revenue $ 74.6 $ 77.6 $ 78.1 $ (3.0 ) (4 )% $ (0.5 ) (1 )% Professional service and other revenue 127.0 107.2 75.5 19.8 18 % 31.7 42 % Total $ 201.6 $ 184.8 $ 153.6 $ 16.8 9 % $ 31.2 20 % Percentage of total revenue 11 % 12 % 11 % Changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing of renewals and the type of contracts renewed on maintenance contracts. Maintenance revenue was relatively flat during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. Professional services and other revenue increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a higher level of consulting services. Professional services and other revenue increased substantially in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily due to professional services contracts assumed from prior acquisitions. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue $ 392.7 $ 340.5 $ 281.1 $ 52.2 15 % $ 59.4 21 % Operating expenses 1,173.3 982.4 915.5 190.9 19 % 66.9 7 % Total $ 1,566.0 $ 1,322.9 $ 1,196.6 $ 243.1 18 % $ 126.3 11 % Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue 89 % 86 % 87 % Our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnel-related costs including salaries, benefits, stock compensation and variable compensation, changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses. The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities, amortization of intangible assets, and depreciation as well as due to an additional week during the fiscal year. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool. Consequently, fluctuations in these drivers impact the amounts allocated to each functional area. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, or fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs. 33 Table of Contents Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) Cost of license revenue $ 232.8 $ 205.5 $ 180.2 $ 27.3 13 % $ 25.3 14 % Cost of maintenance and service revenue 78.6 80.2 64.8 (1.6 ) (2 )% 15.4 24 % Amortization of intangible assets 81.3 54.8 36.1 26.5 48 % 18.7 52 % Total $ 392.7 $ 340.5 $ 281.1 $ 52.2 15 % $ 59.4 21 % Percentage of total revenue 22 % 22 % 20 % We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of license revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported. Cost of license revenue. Cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products which have reached technological feasibility. Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization, and costs associated with the delivery of our consulting services, such as, hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of certain contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions. Cost of revenue increased by $52.2 million or 15% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to increases of $26.5 million in amortization of intangible assets, $19.0 million in personnel-related costs as a result of fiscal 2012 acquisitions and the impact of one extra week of costs of approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2012. Cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in professional service revenue. The increase in cost of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in $16.9 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases from our prior-year acquisitions, an increase of $18.9 million in costs to provide maintenance and professional services, an increase of $2.3 million in hardware and license costs, and an increase of $18.7 million for amortization of intangible assets due to our prior-year acquisitions. 34 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Research and Development Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) $ 581.6 $ 491.9 $ 449.2 $ 89.7 18 % $ 42.7 10 % Percentage of total revenue 33 % 32 % 33 % The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases of $61.0 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions, $11.1 million in functionally allocated expenses as a result of headcount increases from our current year acquisitions, $7.9 million in costs related to acquisitions, and one extra week of costs of approximately $7.5 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase of $31.8 million in personnel-related costs and an increase of $11.9 million in functionally allocated expenses as a result of headcount increases from our prior-year acquisitions.

The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was due to increases in personnel-related costs of $25.6 million primarily driven by headcount increases from our acquisitions, $11.2 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments, $8.9 million in costs related to acquisitions, and one extra week of costs of approximately $4.9 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase of $10.6 million in commissions and other variable compensation, an increase of $9.6 million in other personnel-related costs due to an increase in headcount from prior-year acquisitions, and an increase of $2.7 million in travel-related costs.

The increases were partially offset by a higher allocation of $18.0 million in expenses to other functions in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, as a result of increased expenses in the allocation pool. 35 Table of Contents The decrease in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a decrease of $13.8 million resulting from higher allocation of expenses to other functional areas because of increased headcount. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $3.3 million in personnel-related costs, $6.1 million in facility expenses and $2.9 million in other general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of our prior-year acquisitions. Change in Fair Value of Deferred Compensation The income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset. Acquired In-Process Research and Development In-process research and development (IPR&D) costs relate to in-process technologies acquired in acquisitions. The value assigned to IPR&D is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology, the successful development of the IPR&D, its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which are unknown at the time of determination. Upon completion of development, the underlying intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue. IPR&D projects acquired are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition. IPR&D projects of $3.3 million were completed during fiscal 2012. See Note 3 and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete, and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in current and prior years. Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) Included in cost of revenue $ 81.3 $ 54.8 $ 36.1 $ 26.5 48 % $ 18.7 52 % Included in operating expenses 18.6 14.6 11.6 4.0 27 % 3.0 26 % Total $ 99.9 $ 69.4 $ 47.7 $ 30.5 44 % $ 21.7 45 % Percentage of total revenue 6 % 5 % 3 % Amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. The increases in amortization of intangible assets from fiscal 2010 through 2012 was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts, which is incorporated by reference here. Impairment of Intangible Assets. We did not record any impairment charges to our intangible assets during fiscal 2012, 2011, or 2010. 36 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) Interest income $ 1.6 $ 2.1 $ 5.4 $ (0.5 ) (24 )% $ (3.3 ) (61 )% Interest expense $ (2.0 ) $ (0.1 ) $ (0.3 ) $ (1.9 ) 1,900 % $ 0.2 (67 )% Gain (loss) on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan 7.5 2.4 8.8 5.1 213 % (6.4 ) (73 )% Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) 1.7 1.7 (1.5 ) 0.0 0 % 3.2 (213 )% Other, net 2.3 0.2 2.1 2.1 1,050 % (1.9 ) (90 )% Total $ 11.1 $ 6.3 $ 14.5 $ 4.8 76 % $ (8.2 ) (57 )% The net increase in other income (expense) in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in gain on assets related to our deferred compensation plan, and an increase in premiums on hedge contracts included in other income (expense), net, partially offset by higher interest expense due to a term loan that we entered into in 2012. The net decrease in other income (expense), net in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in gain on assets related to our deferred compensation plan, a decrease in gains on sale of investments included other income (expense), net and lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by foreign exchange fluctuations. Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2012 and 2011 include tax benefits of settlements with the IRS of $15.9 million (for fiscal years 2010 through 2011), with Taiwan of $14.7M (net tax benefit resulting from the 2008 settlement being applied to other open fiscal years), with Hungary of $6.3 million (for fiscal years 2006 through 2010) in fiscal year 2012 and a settlement with the IRS of $32.8 million (for fiscal years 2006 through 2009) in fiscal 2011. Without the impact of the settlements, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 and 2011 would have been 27.7% and 13.9%, respectively. For further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements, see Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our sources of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility. As of October 31, 2012, we held an aggregate of $198.0 million in cash and cash equivalents in the United States and an aggregate of $502.4 million in our foreign subsidiaries. Funds held in our foreign subsidiaries are generated from revenue outside North America. At present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. During the current year we primarily used our cash in foreign subsidiaries to fund our overseas acquisitions of SpringSoft and EVE. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund cash needs in the United States and if U.S. taxes have not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds. The following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2012. 37 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 700.4 $ 855.1 $ (154.7 ) (18 )% Short-term investments — 149.0 (149.0 ) (100 )% Total $ 700.4 $ 1,004.1 $ (303.7 ) (30 )% Our cash generated from operating activities was $486.1 million in fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2012, we liquidated our short-term investments primarily to fund our acquisitions. Other cash activities were (1) payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $970.1 million, (2) net proceeds from sales and purchases of short-term investments of $148.0 million (3) proceeds from a credit facility and term loan of $250.0 million and subsequent repayment of $115.0 million of those loans (4) share repurchases of $40.0 million offset by proceeds from employee stock plans of $175.9 million, and (5) purchases of property and equipment of $54.2 million. Cash flows Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2012 2011 2010 2011 to 2012 2010 to 2011 (dollars in millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 486.1 $ 440.3 $ 341.0 $ 45.8 10 % $ 99.3 29 % Cash (used in) investing activities (879.1 ) (88.8 ) (238.7 ) (790.3 ) 890 % 149.9 (63 )% Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 243.5 (277.6 ) (43.1 ) 521.1 (188 )% (234.5 ) 544 % Cash provided by operating activities We expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront revenue much sooner than from time-based license revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license. Fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. Cash provided by operating activities increased slightly due to an increase in collections from customers, offset partly by higher disbursements to vendors. Fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. Cash provided by operating activities increased due to fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities primarily resulting from increased accounts receivable collections due to timing of billings, offset partly by higher payments due to disbursements to vendors, higher variable compensation costs and higher personnel-related costs due to increased headcount, as well as increased tax payments. Cash used in investing activities Fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2012, partly offset by net proceeds from the purchase and sale of investments. 38 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. The decrease in cash used in financing activities primarily relates to lower cash payments for acquisitions in 2011 offset by lower net proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments and higher property and equipment purchases. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities Fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. The increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to net proceeds from credit facilities obtained primarily to finance our acquisitions and less common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program. Fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011. The increase in cash used relates to common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and accelerated stock repurchase (ASR) program, including cash paid for an equity forward contract as part of the ASR program, partially offset by higher proceeds from issuances of common stock. Accounts Receivable, net Year Ended October 31, 2012 2011 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) $292.7 $203.1 $89.6 44% Our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding (DSO) are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities. Our DSO was 59 days at October 31, 2012 and 47 days at October 31, 2011. The increase in DSO is attributable to the receivables acquired through our acquisitions and the timing of billings at the end of fiscal 2012. Working Capital. Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets: Year Ended October 31, 2012 2011 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets $ 1,140.7 $ 1,338.1 $ (197.4 ) (15 )% Current liabilities 1,252.6 1,010.3 242.3 24 % Working capital $ (111.9 ) $ 327.8 $ (439.7 ) (134 )% Changes in our working capital were primarily due to (1) a $303.7 million decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments used to fund our fiscal 2012 acquisitions, (2) an $89.5 million increase in accounts receivable, (3) a $131.3 million increase in deferred revenue due to timing of our billings, (4) an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $80.9 million, (5) an increase of $30.0 million in short-term debt obligations from our new term loan, and (6) a net $16.7 million increase due to movements in other current assets, and tax-related assets. Other As of October 31, 2012, our cash equivalents consisted of cash deposits, tax-exempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. We proactively manage our cash and cash equivalents and investments balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Additionally, we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our global excess cash, and our cash equivalents and fixed income portfolio invested in banks and securities with a weighted-average credit rating exceeding 39 Table of Contents AA. The majority of our investments are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 investments, as measured under fair value guidance. See Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Commitments On February 17, 2012, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with several lenders (the “Credit Agreement”) providing for (i) a $350.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the “Term Loan”). The Credit Agreement amended and restated our previous credit agreement dated October 14, 2011 in order to add a new term loan facility, primarily to finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Magma on February 22, 2012. Subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the Credit Agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million through October 13, 2015. The Credit Agreement terminates on October 14, 2016. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. At October 31, 2012, borrowings under the Revolver bore interest at LIBOR + 0.975% and borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR + 1.125%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.150% and 0.300% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment. During fiscal 2012, we borrowed $250.0 million under the Credit Agreement. As of October 31, 2012, we had no outstanding balance under the Revolver and a $135.0 million outstanding balance under the Term Loan, and are in compliance with all covenants. $105.0 million of the borrowings under the Term Loan are classified as long term. Principal payments on a portion of the Term Loan are due in equal quarterly installments of $7.5 million beginning in the third quarter of our fiscal 2012, with the remainder due in October 2016. We can elect to make prepayments on the Term Loan, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. During fiscal 2012, we made principal payments of $100.0 million and $15.0 million under the Revolver and Term Loan, respectively. We had no outstanding debt balances as of October 31, 2011. We expect the borrowings under the Revolver will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 31, 2012.

(2) Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2012. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and 40 Table of Contents legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. (3) This commitment relates to the principal on the Term Loan as discussed in Other Commitments above. (4) These other obligations include the Term Loan fees, a credit facility assumed through an acquisition and performance-based contingent consideration obligations. (5) Long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2012. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments in individual years beyond fiscal 2012 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits. The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of October 31, 2012, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements For a description of the effect of new accounting pronouncements on Synopsys, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which information is included herein. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we liquidated our municipal bond investment portfolio and incurred debt primarily to fund the Magma acquisition. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2012, all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. The following tables present our cash equivalents, investments and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates.

We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2012, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $9.3 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $9.3 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $9.3 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. Net unrealized loss of approximately $1.3 million and loss of approximately $12.8 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2012 and October 31, 2011, respectively. If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. 42 Table of Contents We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements.

Our strategic investment portfolio consists of approximately $11.7 million and $4.0 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of October 31, 2012 and October 31, 2011, respectively. These investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. Investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, we wrote down the value of our strategic investment portfolio by $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively. None of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this Item 7 and by the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report regarding forward-looking statements. Business Summary Synopsys is a global leader in providing software, intellectual property and services used to design integrated circuits and electronic systems. We supply the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design, create prototypes for and test integrated circuits, also known as chips. We also supply software and hardware used to develop the systems that incorporate integrated circuits and the software that runs on those integrated circuits. Our intellectual property (IP) products are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than redesigning those circuits themselves. To complement these product offerings, we provide technical services to support our solutions and we help our customers develop chips and electronic systems. Our customers are generally semiconductor and electronics systems companies. Our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while reducing their design and manufacturing costs. While our products are an important part of our customers’ development process, our customers’ research and development budget and spending decisions may be affected by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs. Despite global economic uncertainty, we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years. We achieved these results not only because of our solid execution, leading technology and strong customer relationships, but also because of our time-based revenue business model. Under this model, a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this revenue over the life of the contract, which averages approximately three years. Time-based revenue, which consists of time-based license, maintenance and service revenue, generally represents approximately 90% of our total revenue. The revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period. Due to our business model, decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way. The global economy continues to exhibit some uncertainty, with 2013 being characterized by gradual, and uneven, economic recovery. Nonetheless, our business outlook remains strong based on continued demand for our products, our business model, strong financials, diligent expense management, and acquisition strategy. In addition, consumer demand for electronics has been solid, particularly the demand for mobile devices. Through our recent acquisitions, we have enhanced our technology and expanded our product portfolio and our total addressable market, especially in IP and system-level solutions, which we believe will help drive revenue growth. We believe that the 25 Table of Contents combination of our solid financials, leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us to continue to successfully execute our strategies. Fiscal Year End Our fiscal year generally ends on the Saturday nearest to October 31 and consists of 52 weeks, with the exception that approximately every five years, we have a 53-week year. Fiscal 2013 was a 52-week year ending on November 2, 2013. Fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were 53-week and 52-week years, respectively, ending on November 3, 2012 and October 29, 2011, respectively. The extra week in fiscal 2012 resulted in approximately $26 million of additional revenue, related primarily to time-based licenses, and approximately $16 million of additional expenses. For presentation purposes, this Form 10-K refers to October 31 as the end of our fiscal year. Fiscal 2013 Financial Performance Summary In fiscal 2013, we experienced overall growth in our business, including from our acquisitions, which was reflected in a 36% increase in our net income compared to last year. Compared to fiscal 2012: • Total revenue increased by 12% primarily due to our overall growth and prior-year acquisitions. We continued to derive more than 90% of our revenue from time-based revenue. • Total operating expense and cost of revenues increased by 10% primarily due to employee-related costs as a result of higher headcount, principally from our prior-year acquisitions; higher amortization and depreciation expenses; and product costs. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading “Results of Operations” below are based on our audited results of operations, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and net income. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions, judgments and estimates, and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations, are: • Revenue recognition; • Valuation of stock compensation; • Valuation of intangible assets; and • Income taxes. Revenue Recognition Software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software. Maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees. Hardware revenue consists of FPGA-based emulation and prototyping products. 26 Table of Contents With respect to software licenses, we utilize three license types: • Technology Subscription Licenses (TSLs). TSLs are time-based licenses for a finite term, and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive, or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for, unspecified future technology. We bundle and do not charge separately for post-contract customer support (maintenance) for the term of the license. • Term licenses. Term licenses are also for a finite term, but do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term. The annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee. • Perpetual licenses. Perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional 20 years. Perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive, or to exchange licensed software for, unspecified future technology. Customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually. For the three software license types, we recognize revenue as follows: • TSLs. We typically recognize revenue from TSL fees (which include bundled maintenance) ratably over the term of the license period, or as customer installments become due and payable, whichever is later. Revenue attributable to TSLs is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. • Term licenses. We recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer payments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. • Perpetual licenses. We recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. For perpetual licenses in which less than 75% of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment, we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. We also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events, for example, royalty arrangements. We refer to this revenue as “contingent revenue.” Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs. Such revenue is reported as “time-based license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. These arrangements are not material to our total revenue. We recognize revenue from sales of hardware and perpetual licenses to IP and system-level products in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue attributable to these sales is reported as “upfront license revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations and is not material to our total revenue. We infrequently enter into multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software deliverables such as hardware. We have determined that the software and non-software 27 Table of Contents deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting. We recognize revenue for the separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized depending on the software license type (TSL, term license or perpetual license). Such arrangements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a material effect in future periods. We recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable, and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer. Revenue attributable to maintenance, professional services and training is reported as “maintenance and service revenue” in the consolidated statements of operations. We also enter into arrangements to deliver software products, either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification, or customization of the software. We account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion, contract revenues and costs. We measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project. Revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that only contain software and software related deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). We limit our assessment of VSOE of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately. We have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple-element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient VSOE to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method, recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term, and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer. We recognize revenue from TSLs ratably over the term of the license, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, since there is not sufficient VSOE to allocate the TSL fee between license and maintenance services. We make significant judgments related to revenue recognition. Specifically, in connection with each transaction involving our products, we must evaluate whether: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of software or services has occurred, (3) the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability of the full license or service fee is probable. All four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement. We apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows: • Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists. Prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement, our customary policy is to have a written contract, signed by both the customer and by us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end-user license arrangement or purchase agreement. • Delivery Has Occurred. We deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically. For electronic deliveries, delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer’s hardware. For physical deliveries, the standard transfer terms are typically Freight on Board (FOB) shipping point. We generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders. However, a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and, as a result, timing of revenue recognition, including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter. 28 Table of Contents • The Fee is Fixed or Determinable. Our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement’s payment terms. Our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require 75% or more of the license fee and 100% of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year. If the arrangement includes these terms, we regard the fee as fixed or determinable, and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery (assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met). If the arrangement does not include these terms, we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable. In the case of a TSL, because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because VSOE for maintenance services does not exist for a TSL, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license, but not in advance of when customers’ installments become due and payable. • Collectability is Probable. We judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer-by-customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy. We typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection. For a new customer, or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments, we evaluate the customer’s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review. We increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer. If we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer’s payment history, we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received. Valuation of Stock Compensation Stock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. We estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards. We determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards. We calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends. These input factors are subjective and are determined using management’s judgment. If a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs. Any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter. Valuation of Intangible Assets We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets consist of purchased technology, contract rights intangibles, customer-relationships, trademarks and trade names, covenants not to compete, capitalized software development, and in-process research and development. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce 29 Table of Contents the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value. Any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. We did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal 2013, 2012 or 2011. Income Taxes Our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse, and for tax loss and credit carryovers. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately $307.2 million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of October 31, 2013 will ultimately be realized. However, if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made. We apply a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws. We are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes. If we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, we would record an additional charge to earnings. Results of Operations Revenue Background We generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses, maintenance and professional services and to a small extent, hardware products. Under current accounting rules and policies, we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses, services and hardware products at varying times. In most instances, we recognize revenue on a TSL software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered. The average license term of the TSLs and term licenses we entered into in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 was 3.6 years, 2.7 years and 2.8 years, respectively. Revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development. Revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped. Contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs. 30 Table of Contents Revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period (normally one year). Revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized after services are performed and accepted by the customer. Our revenue in any period is equal to the sum of our time-based license, upfront license, maintenance and professional services for the period. We derive time-based license revenue largely from TSL orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements. We derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the period. We derive maintenance revenue largely from maintenance orders received in prior periods since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year. We also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters, since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted or on percentage of completion for arrangements requiring significant modification of our software, and not when they are booked. Our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of TSLs and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period. A TSL order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods. For example, a $120,000 order for a three-year TSL delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter, but $10,000 in each of the twelve succeeding quarters. Conversely, a $120,000 order for perpetual and term licenses with greater than 75% of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generates $120,000 in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered, but no future revenue. Additionally, revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than 75% of the license fees and 100% of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable. Our customer arrangements are complex, involving hundreds of products and various license rights, and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements. For example, they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions, support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost. No single factor typically drives our customers’ buying decisions, and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive EDA market. Customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes. Total Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) $1,962.2 $ 1,756.0 $ 1,535.6 $ 206.2 12 % $ 220.4 14 % The overall growth of our business has been the primary driver of the increase in our revenue. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations, primarily due to customer requirements, including payment terms and the timing and value of contract renewals. The sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2013 was due to our organic growth and revenues from acquired companies. The increases were primarily in time-based license revenue. Fiscal 2012 had approximately $26 million of additional revenue due to the additional week in that fiscal year. 31 Table of Contents Time-Based License Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) $ 1,599.5 $ 1,449.3 $ 1,260.3 $ 150.2 10 % $ 189.0 15 % Percentage of total revenue 82 % 83 % 82 % The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to increases in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods, including those from acquisitions in fiscal 2012 and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and to a lesser extent, due to other time-based arrangements. The increase was partially offset by the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2012. The increase in time-based license revenue for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to increases in TSL license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods and from the contracts acquired through fiscal 2012 acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, due to higher contingent revenue, product sales, the impact of the additional week in fiscal 2012 and other time-based arrangements. Upfront License Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) $ 132.0 $ 105.1 $ 90.5 $ 26.9 26 % $ 14.6 16 % Percentage of total revenue 7 % 6 % 6 % Changes in upfront license revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements, which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period. The increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products and perpetual licenses to IP and system-level products, including those derived from our acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products and perpetual licenses to IP and system-level products. As our sales of hardware and perpetual licenses to IP and system-level products continue to grow, we expect upfront license revenue to increase as a percentage of total revenue, but remain consistent with our business model in which approximately 90% of our total revenue consists of time-based revenue. Maintenance and Service Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) Maintenance revenue $ 79.2 $ 74.6 $ 77.6 $ 4.6 6 % $ (3.0 ) (4 )% Professional service and other revenue 151.5 127.0 107.2 24.5 19 % 19.8 18 % Total $ 230.7 $ 201.6 $ 184.8 $ 29.1 14 % $ 16.8 9 % Percentage of total revenue 12 % 11 % 12 % 32 Table of Contents Changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing of renewals and the type of contracts renewed with the associated maintenance. Maintenance revenue was relatively flat during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011. The sequential increase in professional services and other revenue from fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in IP consulting services. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) Cost of revenue $ 453.6 $ 392.7 $ 340.5 $ 60.8 15 % $ 52.2 15 % Operating expenses 1,262.2 1,173.3 982.4 88.9 8 % 190.9 19 % Total $ 1,715.8 $ 1,566.0 $ 1,322.9 $ 149.7 10 % $ 243.1 18 % Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue 87 % 89 % 86 % Our expenses are generally impacted by changes in personnel-related costs including salaries, benefits, stock compensation and variable compensation, changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses. The increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs, driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and related fixed charges including facilities, amortization of intangible assets, and depreciation. The increases in our expenses were partially offset by the extra week of expenses in fiscal 2012 of $16 million. We allocate certain human resource programs, information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area. Annually, or upon a significant change in headcount (such as a workforce reduction, realignment or acquisition) or other factors, management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool. Consequently, fluctuations in these drivers impact the amounts allocated to each functional area. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, or fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs. Cost of Revenue Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) Cost of license revenue $ 268.9 $ 232.8 $ 205.5 $ 36.1 16 % $ 27.3 13 % Cost of maintenance and service revenue 80.4 78.6 80.2 1.8 2 % (1.6 ) (2 )% Amortization of intangible assets 104.3 81.3 54.8 23.0 28 % 26.5 48 % Total $ 453.6 $ 392.7 $ 340.5 $ 60.9 16 % $ 52.2 15 % Percentage of total revenue 23 % 22 % 22 % We divide cost of revenue into three categories: cost of license revenue, cost of maintenance and service revenue, and amortization of intangible assets. We segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions providing license delivery and post-customer contract support services. We then allocate these group 33 Table of Contents costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported. Cost of license revenue. Cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed, allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs, royalties paid to third party vendors, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products which have reached technological feasibility. Cost of maintenance and service revenue. Cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization, and costs associated with the delivery of our consulting services, such as, hotline and on-site support, production services and documentation of maintenance updates. Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets, which is recorded to cost of revenue and operating expenses, includes the amortization of certain contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, and covenants not to compete related to acquisitions. Cost of revenue increased by $60.9 million or 16% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to increases of $23.0 million in amortization of intangible assets and $17.7 million in personnel-related costs, primarily as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2012, particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and $25.9 million in product costs primarily due to product sales. The increase in cost of revenue was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2012 and a $1.3 million reduction in acquisition-related costs compared to fiscal 2012. Cost of revenue increased by $52.2 million or 15% in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to increases of $26.5 million in amortization of intangible assets, $19.0 million in personnel-related costs as a result of fiscal 2012 acquisitions and the impact of one extra week of costs of approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2012.

The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $7.5 million in fiscal 2012 and a $6.3 million reduction in acquisition-related costs compared to fiscal 2012. The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases of $61.0 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions, $11.1 million in functionally allocated expenses as a result of headcount increases from our current year acquisitions, $7.9 million in costs related to acquisitions, and one extra week of costs of approximately $7.5 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. 34 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) $ 426.0 $ 415.6 $ 363.1 $ 10.4 3 % $ 52.5 14 % Percentage of total revenue 22 % 24 % 24 % Changes in commissions and other variable compensation are generally attributable to the volume of contracts and timing of shipments based on contract requirements. The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was due to increases in personnel-related costs of $15.9 million primarily driven by headcount increases, $2.0 million in marketing activities, and $1.4 million in maintenance. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was partially offset by an additional week of expenses of approximately $4.9 million in fiscal 2012 and a $5.2 million reduction in acquisition-related costs compared to fiscal 2012. The increase in sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was due to increases in personnel-related costs of $25.6 million primarily driven by headcount increases from our acquisitions, $11.2 million in variable compensation due to higher shipments, $8.9 million in costs related to acquisitions, and one extra week of costs of approximately $4.9 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. General and Administrative Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) $ 143.8 $ 157.5 $ 112.8 ($ 13.7 ) (9 )% $ 44.7 40 % Percentage of total revenue 7 % 9 % 7 % The decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to a decrease in acquisition-related costs of $25.4 million compared to fiscal 2012 and higher allocation of $7.7 million in expenses to other functions (cost of revenue, research and development, and sales and marketing) in fiscal 2013 as headcount growth in those functions, primarily driven by acquisitions, resulted in an increase in the pool of expenses to be allocated. The decrease in general and administrative expense was partially offset by increases of $15.2 million in professional service costs, $5.4 million in facilities and depreciation expenses, primarily due to our acquisitions, and $2.2 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions. The increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases of $15.9 million in personnel-related costs as a result of headcount increases primarily from our acquisitions, $24.5 million in costs related to acquisitions, $6.8 million in facility expenses, $5.8 million in depreciation and maintenance expenses and one extra week of costs of approximately $1.6 million in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. The increases were partially offset by a higher allocation of $18.0 million in expenses to other functions in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, as a result of increased expenses in the allocation pool. Change in Fair Value of Deferred Compensation The income or loss arising from the change in fair value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in cost of sales and each functional operating expense, with the offsetting change in the fair value of the related assets recorded in other income (expense), net. These assets are classified as trading securities. There is no overall impact to our net income from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and asset. 35 Table of Contents Acquired In-Process Research and Development In-process research and development (IPR&D) costs relate to in-process technologies acquired in acquisitions. The value assigned to IPR&D is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value. The utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology, the successful development of the IPR&D, its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances, all of which are unknown at the time of determination. Upon completion of development, the underlying intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life and recorded in cost of revenue. IPR&D projects acquired are anticipated to be completed over a period of one to three years from the date of the acquisition. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of contract rights and the amortization of core/developed technology, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships, covenants not to compete, and in-process research and development related to acquisitions completed in prior years. Amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change $ Change % Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) Included in cost of revenue $ 104.3 $ 81.3 $ 54.8 $ 23.0 28 % $ 26.5 48 % Included in operating expenses 23.2 18.6 14.6 4.6 25 % 4.0 27 % Total $ 127.5 $ 99.9 $ 69.4 $ 27.6 28 % $ 30.5 44 % Percentage of total revenue 6 % 6 % 5 % Amortization of capitalized software development costs is not presented in the above table and is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. The increases in amortization of intangible assets from fiscal 2011 through 2013 were primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts, which is incorporated by reference here. Impairment of Intangible Assets. We did not record any impairment charges to our intangible assets during fiscal 2013, 2012, or 2011.

The net increase in other income (expense) in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in gain on assets related to our deferred compensation plan, and an increase in premiums on foreign currency contracts included in other income (expense), net, partially offset by higher interest expense due to a term loan that we entered into in fiscal 2012. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 included tax benefits from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal research tax credit of approximately $19.0 million, reversal of deferred taxes resulting from the merger of a foreign affiliate of $6.8 million, and settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of certain issues related to fiscal 2012 of $1.1 million. The reinstatement of the research tax credit resulted in an additional tax credit for ten months of fiscal 2012 as well as a full year credit for fiscal 2013, compared to only two months of credit in fiscal 2012 as a result of the expiration of the credit on December 31, 2011. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 included tax benefits from settlements with the IRS of $15.9 million (for fiscal years 2010 through 2011), with Taiwan tax authorities of $14.7 million (net tax benefit resulting from the 2008 settlement being applied to other open fiscal years), and with Hungarian tax authorities of $6.3 million (for fiscal years 2006 through 2010). For further discussion of the provision for income taxes and settlements, see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our sources of cash and cash equivalents are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility. As of October 31, 2013, we held an aggregate of $468.4 million in cash and cash equivalents in the United States and an aggregate of $554.0 million in our foreign subsidiaries. Funds held in our foreign subsidiaries are generated from revenue outside North America. At present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries to the extent of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund cash needs in the United States and if U.S. taxes have not already been previously accrued, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes in order to repatriate these funds. The following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows, and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2013. Cash and cash equivalents Year Ended October 31, $ Change % Change 2013 2012 (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,022.4 $ 700.4 $ 322.0 46 % Our cash generated from operating activities was $496.7 million in fiscal 2013. Other cash activities were (1) share repurchases of $145.0 million offset by proceeds from employee stock plans of $131.9 million, (2) purchases of property and equipment of $65.5 million offset by proceeds from sale of property and equipment of $2.0 million, (3) acquisition of the non-controlling interest in SpringSoft, Inc. for $44.0 million, and (4) repayment of a term loan of $30.0 million. 37 Table of Contents Cash flows Year Ended October 31, $ Change $ Change 2013 2012 2011 2012 to 2013 2011 to 2012 (dollars in millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 496.7 $ 486.1 $ 440.3 $ 10.6 $ 45.8 Cash (used in) investing activities (66.1 ) (879.1 ) (88.8 ) 813.0 (790.3 ) Cash (used in) provided by financing activities (98.0 ) 243.5 (277.6 ) (341.5 ) 521.1 Cash provided by operating activities We expect cash from our operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of our billings and collections, our operating results, the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments. Cash provided by our operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements. We generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from time-based license revenue, in which the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually over the term of the license. Fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013. Cash provided by operating activities increased slightly due to an increase in collections from customers and a decrease in tax payments, offset partly by higher disbursements to vendors and higher personnel-related costs due to increased headcount. Fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. Cash provided by operating activities increased slightly due to an increase in collections from customers, offset partly by higher disbursements to vendors. Cash used in investing activities Fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in acquisition activities in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash used for acquisitions in fiscal 2012, partly offset by net proceeds from the purchase and sale of investments. Cash provided by (used in) financing activities Fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increased common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, proceeds from credit facilities in fiscal 2012 that did not recur in the current period and less proceeds from issuances of common stock. Fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012. The increase in cash provided by financing activities primarily relates to net proceeds from credit facilities obtained primarily to finance our acquisitions and less common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program. Accounts Receivable, net Year Ended October 31, 2013 2012 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) $256.0 $292.7 $(36.7) (13)% Our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding (DSO) are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities. Our DSO was 46 days at October 31, 2013 and 59 days at October 31, 2012. The decrease in DSO is attributable to the increase in collections from customers. 38 Table of Contents Working Capital. Working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets: Year Ended October 31, 2013 2012 $ Change % Change (dollars in millions) Current assets $ 1,448.0 $ 1,140.7 $ 307.3 27 % Current liabilities 1,222.9 1,252.6 (29.7 ) (2 )% Working capital $ 225.1 $ (111.9 ) $ 337.0 (301 )% Changes in our working capital were primarily due to (1) a $322.1 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, (2) a $24.9 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of disbursements, (3) a $17.3 million increase in deferred income taxes, and (4) a $7.3 million decrease in deferred revenue due to timing of our billings. These changes in working capital were partially offset by a $36.6 million decrease in accounts receivable attributable to timing and a $2.5 million increase in accrued income taxes. Other As of October 31, 2013, our cash equivalents consisted of cash deposits, tax-exempt money market mutual funds, and taxable money market mutual funds. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. We proactively manage our cash and cash equivalents balances and closely monitor our capital and stock repurchase expenditures to ensure ample liquidity. Our cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 under fair value guidance. See Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Commitments On February 17, 2012, we entered into an agreement with several lenders (the Credit Agreement) providing for (i) a $350.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) and (ii) a $150.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility (the Term Loan). Principal payments on a portion of the Term Loan are due in equal quarterly installments of $7.5 million, with the remainder due when the Credit Agreement expires in October 2016. We can elect to make prepayments on the Term Loan, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. Subject to obtaining additional commitments from lenders, the principal amount of the loans provided under the Credit Agreement may be increased by us by up to an additional $150.0 million through October 13, 2015. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to operate within a maximum leverage ratio and maintain specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. As of October 31, 2013, we had a $105.0 million outstanding balance under the Term Loan, of which $75.0 million is classified as long-term, and no outstanding balance under the Revolver. As of October 31, 2012, we had a $135.0 million outstanding balance under the Term Loan, of which $105.0 million is classified as long-term, and no outstanding balance under the Revolver. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate based on a margin over our choice of market-observable base rates as defined in the Credit Agreement. At October 31, 2013, borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR + 1.125% and the applicable interest rate for the Revolver was LIBOR + 0.975%. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the Revolver at rates between 0.150% and 0.300% per year based on our leverage ratio on the daily amount of the revolving commitment. 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 31, 2013: Total Fiscal2014 Fiscal 2015/Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2017/Fiscal 2018 Thereafter Other (in thousands) Lease Obligations: Capital Lease $ 2,418 $ 2,418 $ — $ — $ — $ — Operating Leases(1) $ 402,750 $ 46,492 $ 71,440 $ 61,875 $ 222,943 $ — Purchase Obligations(2) 95,345 30,131 63,366 1,848 — — Term Loan(3) 105,000 30,000 75,000 — — — Other Long-Term Obligations(4) 3,190 1,568 1,622 — — — Long term accrued income taxes(5) 53,064 — — — — $ 53,064 Total $ 661,767 $ 110,609 $ 211,428 $ 63,723 $ 222,943 $ 53,064 (1) See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of October 31, 2013. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. (3) This commitment relates to the principal on the Term Loan as discussed in Other Commitments above. (4) These other obligations include a loan assumed through an acquisition and the fees associated with our Term Loan and Revolver. (5) Long-term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of October 31, 2013. Currently, a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments in individual years beyond fiscal 2013 cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits. The expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of October 31, 2013, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt. As of October 31, 2013, all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable interest rates. While par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. 40 Table of Contents The following tables present our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates: As of October 31, 2013 Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2014 2015 2016 Total Fair Value (in thousands) Cash equivalent (variable rate) $ 839,149 $ — $ — $ 839,149 $ 839,149 Average interest rate 0.16 % — % — % Short-term debt (variable rate) Term Loan $ 30,000 $ — $ — $ 30,000 $ 30,000 Average interest rate LIBOR +1.125 % — % — % Long-term debt (variable rate) Term Loan $ — $ 30,000 $ 45,000 $ 75,000 $ 75,000 Average interest rate — % LIBOR +1.125 % LIBOR +1.125 % As of October 31, 2012 Maturing in Year Ending October 31, 2013 2014 2015 2016 Total Fair Value (in thousands) Cash equivalent (variable rate) $ 533,221 $ — $ — $ — $ 533,221 $ 533,221 Average interest rate 0.39 % — % — % — % Short-term debt (variable rate) Term Loan $ 30,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 30,000 $ 30,000 Average interest rate LIBOR +1.125 % — % — % — % Long-term debt (variable rate) Term Loan $ 30,000 $ 30,000 $ 45,000 $ 105,000 $ 105,000 Average interest rate LIBOR +1.125 % LIBOR +1.125 % LIBOR +1.125 % Foreign Currency Risk. We operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. The functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary’s local currency. We enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. The duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months. A description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in Note 2 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. To the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. For example, if the Euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the U.S. dollar prior to the settlement of the Euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of October 31, 2013, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 41 Table of Contents $9.2 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $9.2 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. At the same time, the U.S. dollar value of our Euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $9.2 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. Net unrealized losses of approximately $1.8 million and $1.3 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2013 and October 31, 2012, respectively. If estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements.

We have approximately $11.5 million and $11.7 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of October 31, 2013 and October 31, 2012, respectively. These investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. The cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. Investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. During fiscal 2013, we did not write down the value of our investment portfolio and during fiscal 2012, we wrote down our investment portfolio by $0.5 million. None of our investments are held for speculation purposes. 43 Table of Contents Selected Unaudited Quarterly Financial Data The table below includes certain unaudited financial information for the last four fiscal quarters.
