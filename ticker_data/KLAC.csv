319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2003,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis, and the audit committee has reviewed the Company’s disclosure relating to them in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sale price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred or services rendered, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We changed our interpretation of “delivery” based on guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101) effective July 1, 2000. Prior to adoption of SAB 101, we generally recognized system revenue when title transferred to the customer (mostly upon shipment). System revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product. We now generally recognize system revenue upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to pre-determined specifications. This positive affirmation is generally evidenced by an acceptance document signed by the customer. This change has the impact of prolonging the cycle time between order placement and revenue recognition. In limited cases, we allow for exceptions where we recognize system revenue upon shipment if acceptance is not required; however, these exceptions have accounted for approximately 3.1% and 2.5% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended 2003 and 2002. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under “Revenue Recognition” for detailed description of exceptions.) Page 28 Revenue from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement. Such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services and/or upgrades. If vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. In instances where an arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or customization, license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting. Allowances are established for potential product returns and credit losses. To date, revenue from license fees have been less than 10% of total revenue. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement, which includes a software license agreement, amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed. The deferred system profit balance as of June 30, 2003 was $177 million. This amount equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment and deferred under SAB 101 less applicable product and warranty costs. The deferred profit balance decreased from $194 million at June 30, 2002 primarily because shipments were lower than customer acceptance for which revenue was recognized during fiscal 2003. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. The unearned revenue balance decreased to $48 million at June 30, 2003 from $55 million at June 30, 2002 primarily due to the increase in service revenue recognized from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. Inventory Reserves We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. For production inventory, our methodology involves matching our on-hand and on-order inventory with our build forecast over the next twelve months. We then evaluate the parts found to be in excess of the twelve-month demand and take appropriate reserves to reflect the risk of obsolescence. For spare parts inventory, we match our on-hand inventory against twenty-four months of usage. We then evaluate the parts in excess of the twenty-four month usage and take appropriate reserves to reflect risk of obsolescence. Both methodologies are significantly affected by the usage assumption. The longer the time period of estimated usage, the lower the reserves are required. Based on our past experience, we believe the twelve-month/twenty-four month time periods best reflect the reasonable and relative obsolescence risks. If actual demand or usage were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inventory reserves, once established, are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold. Page 29 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of our customers were adversely affected resulting in their inability to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Warranty We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of sales when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges every quarter. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions for which there is limited or no historical product performance on which to base the estimated warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Contingencies and Litigation We are currently named as a party to various legal proceedings, including those outlined in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we currently believe the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, both individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position but may adversely affect our quarterly operating results, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. We would accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if, in our estimation, the adverse settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the ultimate cost to us. We have made no such accruals as of June 30, 2003. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. Page 30 On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Results of Operations During fiscal 2003 we continued to face a significant downturn in the semiconductor industry, which started in early calendar year 2001. In calendar year 2001, the demand for semiconductors dropped by approximately 32% and remained flat to slightly higher in calendar year 2002. Although new orders grew, quarter on quarter by approximately $21 million in the three months ended June 30, 2003, we are still cautious about the timing of a broad based turnaround in the growth of demand for semiconductors looking forward. Electronics industry analysts forecast semiconductor shipments for calendar year 2003 to grow over calendar year 2002. Over the longer term, we expect process control to continue to represent a higher percentage of our customers’ capital spending. We believe this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to copper and other new materials, and the transition to new 300-millimeter fabs. We anticipate these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services when the semiconductor industry recovers. New system and service orders by region were as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year Fiscal Quarter 2003 2003 Fourth Third Second First United States $ 374 $ 104 $ 98 $ 92 $ 80 Europe 167 39 40 58 30 Japan 289 101 64 67 57 Taiwan 135 28 44 17 46 Asia Pacific 216 65 70 52 29 Total orders $ 1,181 $ 337 $ 316 $ 286 $ 242 Page 31 KLA-Tencor’s backlog for unshipped system orders as of June 30, 2003 was approximately $509 million, a majority of which we expect to ship over the next six to nine months. In addition, we have $351 million of SAB 101 deferred revenue that is related to products that have been delivered but are awaiting written acceptance from the customer. Revenues and Gross Margin Product revenue in fiscal 2003 decreased $368 million, or 26% to $1.06 billion, from $1.43 billion in fiscal 2002. Product revenue decreased $479 million, or 25%, to $1.43 billion in fiscal 2002 from $1.91 billion in fiscal 2001. Product revenue declines were primarily from reduced capital spending by our customers as a result of a significant reduction in the demand for semiconductors over the last two years. In fiscal 2003, international product revenue increased slightly to 71% of revenue, from 69% in fiscal 2002, due to higher demand in Taiwan. In fiscal 2002, international product revenue increased slightly to 69% of revenue, from 67% in the prior year, due to higher demand in Japan and Western Europe, partially offset by lower demand in Taiwan. Service revenue is generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. Service revenues were $263 million, $209 million, and $196 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively. Service revenue continued to increase throughout the 3-year-period as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenue generated is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the degree of utilization of those systems. Gross margins as a percentage of revenues were 49%, 50% and 55% in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 were primarily due to reduced capacity utilization, resulting from lower business volume and an increased percentage of revenue in the lower margin service business. Although gross margins fell below the 50% level in fiscal 2003, we have implemented plans for continued expense reductions aimed at bringing margins back above the 50% range even if industry conditions remain weak. Our plans for expense reduction include streamlining manufacturing costs through the use of common platforms, leveraging manufacturing procurement through consolidation of vendors and further expanding on outsourcing initiatives. Engineering, Research and Development Net engineering, research and development expenses were $268 million, $287 million, and $356 million, or 20%, 18% and 17% of revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The absolute dollars decreased in fiscal 2003, compared to fiscal 2002, due to engineering programs reaching certain milestones that resulted in reductions in labor and material expense, additional external funding and cost saving measures such as company mandated time-off and reduction in discretionary spending implemented over the last several quarters in response to the industry slow down. The dollars decreased in fiscal 2002, compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to temporary shutdowns, management pay cuts, reductions in temporary labor and discretionary spending as well as other cost saving measures implemented over the last year. We expect our net engineering, research and development expenses to be flat to slightly up in absolute dollars as we make investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and existing product enhancements. Page 32 Net engineering, research and development expenses were partially offset by $18 million, $14 million and $8 million in external funding received under certain strategic development programs conducted with several of our customers and government grants in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development efforts. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to copper and other new materials, and the transition to new 300-millimeter fabs. Our investments in new technology and existing product enhancements are intended to enable our customers to achieve a higher return on their capital investments and higher productivity through cost-effective, leading edge technology solutions. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses were $254 million, $291 million and $354 million, or 19%, 18% and 17% of revenues, in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The absolute dollars for selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to company mandated time-off, reductions in labor and discretionary spending as well as other cost saving measures implemented over the last several quarters in response to the industry slowdown and the ongoing global economic weakness. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to be flat to slightly down in absolute dollars as we continue to realize the benefits from these cost saving measures. Non-Recurring Acquisition, Restructuring and Other Charges The following is a summary of non-recurring acquisition, restructuring and other charges for the three fiscal years ending June 30: (in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Acquired in-process research and development expense $ - $ - $ 700 Facilities 4,623 - 4,713 Severance 1,127 - 1,595 Non-recurring income from iSupport sale (15,152) - (10,029) Others - - 1,018 $ (9,402) $ - $ (2,003) Page 33 Restructuring and Other Charges In fiscal 2003, we structured certain of our operations to realign costs with planned business levels in light of the industry downturn. We classified restructuring costs into two main categories: facilities and other charges of $4.6 million and severance and benefits of $1.1 million. As part of the facilities consolidation, we exited several of our leased buildings and have included the remaining net book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease payments, net of anticipated sublease revenue, in the charge. Severance and benefit charges were related to the involuntary termination of approximately 70 personnel from manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and administration in the United States, Japan and Europe. The restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2003 are proceeding as planned, with the termination of employees having been completed and the facilities related lease payments scheduled to be completed by the end of fiscal 2004. In addition, during the first fiscal quarter of 2003, we received $15.2 million as a second and final installment on the sale of software and intellectual property associated with our iSupport™ on-line customer support technology, which was netted against the above non-recurring charges, resulting in a reported net gain of $9.4 million In addition to the restructuring action, we also recorded severance charges totaling $10.9 million in operating expenses, throughout fiscal 2003, relating to a series of employee involuntary terminations. We believe that both these actions will result in annual reductions in costs of goods sold and operating expenses of approximately $60 million. In fiscal 2002, there were no restructuring charges. We recorded severance charges of $8.5 million in operating expenses relating to a series of employee involuntary terminations throughout fiscal 2002. This resulted in annual cost reductions in costs of goods sold and operating expenses of approximately $44 million. In fiscal 2001, in response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry, we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce spending. Charges related to the restructuring plan included: facilities of $4.7 million, severance and benefits of $1.6 million, and other costs of $1.0 million. Facilities related charges were associated with two of our leased office buildings that were vacated and included the remaining net book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease payments, net of anticipated sublease revenue in the charge. During fiscal 2001, we reduced our workforce by approximately 5%, primarily in the manufacturing areas and recorded severance charges related to these terminations. The restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2001 were substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2002. These restructuring actions resulted in annual reductions in cost of goods sold and operation expenses of approximately $18 million. In addition, during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, we sold software and intellectual property associated with its iSupport™ on-line customer support technology and recorded $10.0 million pretax, non-recurring income, which was netted with the other non-recurring charges. The following table shows the details of the facilities, severance and other restructuring costs accrual for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003: (in thousands) Balance at Amounts Amounts Balance at June 30, 2002 Expensed Utilized June 30, 2003 Facilities and other $ 405 $ 4,623 $ (1,835) $ 3,193 Severance and benefits -- 1,127 (1,080) 47 Total $ 405 $ 5,750 $ (2,915) $ 3,240 Page 34 The semiconductor equipment industry that we operate in is a highly cyclical industry. This cyclical nature affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels. We are currently in a down cycle, and if this current down cycle continues to linger or worsens, we may need to take appropriate actions to scale down operating expenses to even lower business levels. Acquisitions During fiscal years 2002 and 2001, we completed certain purchase acquisitions. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material on either an individual or aggregate basis. For a period of up to twelve months from the acquisition date, we may change the original purchase price allocation for pre-acquisition uncertainties. After twelve months, we record the fair value of such reasonably estimable contingencies. The amounts allocated to in-process research and development (“in-process R&D”) were determined through established valuation techniques in the high-technology equipment industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technology feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. Amounts allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding five years. A summary of purchase transactions is outlined as follows (in thousands): Acquisition year Acquired Company/Assets Consideration Including Assumed Liabilities Acquisition Cost Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets In-Process R&D Expenses Fiscal 2002 QC Optics(1) $ 4,000 $ - $4,000 $ - Fiscal 2001 Phase Metrics(2) $18,000 $1,300 $5,400 $700 (1) With the acquisition of QC Optics, we received certain intellectual property in laser-based inspection systems for the semiconductor, flat panel and computer hard disk manufacturing industries. (2) KLA-Tencor acquired certain assets and technology of Phase Metrics, the leading supplier of inspection/certification products in the data storage industry. The difference between the purchase price and the goodwill, intangibles and in-process R&D represents amount allocated to the net tangible assets acquired. There was no deferred stock-based compensation for any of the acquisitions. Page 35 Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net was $42 million, $43 million and $54 million in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on the investment and cash portfolio, gains realized on sales of marketable securities and income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The decrease in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to decreased interest income resulting from declining interest rates and an increase in foreign currency losses resulting from increased volatility in foreign exchange markets partially offset by an increase in realized gains on investments resulting from investment decisions which impacted the timing of realizing gains and losses for these investments. The decrease in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to decreased interest income resulting from declining interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes KLA-Tencor’s effective income tax rate was 24%, 25% and 27% in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In general, our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% largely as a function of benefits realized from our Extraterritorial Income (“ETI”) exclusion, research and development tax credits and income derived from tax exempt interest. The overall reduction in our effective income tax rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 of 1% is primarily the result of more R&D credit, more tax-exempt interest and less nondeductible losses relative to these same items as a percentage of pre-tax income in the prior fiscal year. These reductions were partially offset by more relative foreign tax expense. The overall reduction in our effective income tax rate from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 of 2%, was the result of a combination of factors, most important of which, were more export sales benefits, more tax-exempt interest income and less state tax expense relative to these same items as a percentage of pre-tax income in fiscal 2001. These reductions were partially offset by more relative foreign tax expense. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, amounts of tax-exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. There currently is pending legislation to repeal the existing export incentive provided by the United States Internal Revenue Code. If the legislation were enacted it would likely increase our effective rate in future periods. Page 36 Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital was $1.16 billion as of June 30, 2003, compared to $932 million as of June 30, 2002. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities at June 30, 2003 increased to $957 million from $673 million at June 30, 2002. In addition, we maintained $531 million and $660 million in marketable securities classified as long-term as of June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. KLA-Tencor has historically financed its operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $246 million, $270 million, and $408 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to a decline in net income, increase in gains from sale of investments and other long-term assets partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances. Net income decreased in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to declining shipments, revenues and gross margins partially offset by decreased engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses associated with cost saving measures in response to the industry slowdown. Gains from the sale of investments increased due to investment decision regarding the timing of realizing gains and losses on these investments. Accounts receivable declined primarily due to strong collection efforts, as well as lower shipments. The reduction in inventory primarily occurred in production inventory, where stringent processes have been put in place for managing material procurement. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was primarily due to decreased income before the cumulative effect of accounting change and lower accounts payable, partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances. Income before cumulative effect of accounting change decreased in fiscal 2002, compared to fiscal 2001, primarily due to declining shipments, revenues and gross margins partially offset by decreased engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses associated with cost saving measures in response to the industry slowdown. Accounts payable shrank due to decreased expenditures and lower incoming invoices. Accounts receivable declined primarily due to strong collection efforts, as well as lower shipments. The reduction in inventory was driven primarily in production inventory, where stringent processes have been put in place for managing material procurement. We have agreements with two Japanese institutions to sell without recourse certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes. During fiscal 2003 we sold $99 million and during 2002 we sold $98 million of trade notes and accounts receivable from Japanese customers, under these arrangements. At June 30, 2003 and 2002, $27 million and $48 million, respectively, of these receivables and notes were outstanding, which have not been included in our consolidated balance sheet as the criteria for sale treatment established by SFAS 140 have been met. Under SFAS 140, after a transfer of financial assets, an entity derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished. The total amount available under the facilities is the Japanese yen equivalent of $92 million based upon exchange rates as of June 30, 2003. We do not believe we are materially at risk for any losses as a result of these agreements. Page 37 Cash used in investing activities was $99 million, $362 million and $295 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long-term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new market segments or emerging technologies. Additions of capital assets during fiscal 2003 consisted mainly of the purchase of certain of our leased buildings in November 2002 compared to fiscal 2002 additions that consisted mainly of the planned completion of our Livermore facilities. We generated $27 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2003 compared with $9 million and $58 million of cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of our common stock, as well as borrowings and repayments of debt. Issuance of common stock, net of repurchases, provided $27 million in fiscal 2003. Repurchases of common stock, net of issuance, used $8 million and $60 million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively. We have adopted a plan for the systematic repurchase of shares of our common stock in the open market to reduce the dilution created by our stock-based employee benefit and incentive plans. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through June 30, 2003 our Board of Directors has authorized KLA-Tencor to repurchase a total of 17.8 million shares, including 5 million shares authorized in October 2002. In fiscal 2003, we repurchased 1,972,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $33.42 per share, for a total of $66 million. In fiscal 2002, we repurchased 3,341,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $36.89 per share, for a total of $123 million. In fiscal 2001, we repurchased 4,580,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $33.54 per share, for a total of $154 million. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through June 30, 2003, we have repurchased a total of 13,321,000 shares at an average price of $32.70 per share, with an additional 4.5 million shares available for repurchase under the plan. All repurchased shares remain as treasury shares. Certain of our leased facilities qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS 13, “Accounting for Leases,” and, as such, the facilities are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lease agreement for certain Milpitas and San Jose, California facilities had a term of five years ending in November 2002, with an option to extend up to two more years. Under the terms of the lease, we, at our option, could acquire the properties at their original cost or arrange for the properties to be acquired. In November 2002, we purchased these facilities at the end of the lease term. The purchase transaction increased land and property by approximately $120 million and decreased cash by the same amount. At June 30, 2003, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.49 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, our management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months. Page 38 The following is a schedule summarizing our significant operating lease commitments as of June 30, 2003 (in millions): Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Operating leases $ 21.8 $ 7.3 $4.9 $2.8 $ 1.6 $ 1.2 $ 4.0 Additionally, we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time-horizon can vary amongst different suppliers. As such, it is difficult to accurately report our true open commitments at any particular point in time. However, we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of June 30, 2003 to be no more than $42 million. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, INCLUDING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Fluctuations in Operating Results and Stock Price Our operating results have varied widely in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon numerous factors, including those listed in this section and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, future operating results may not follow any past trends. We believe the factors that could make our results fluctuate and difficult to predict include: o global economic uncertainty; o the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; o changing international economic conditions; o competitive pressure; o our ability to develop and implement new technologies and introduce new products; o our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements; o our ability to protect our intellectual property; o our ability to attract, retain, and replace key employees; o worldwide political instability; and o earthquake and other uninsured risks. Operating results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer requirements, currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business. As a result of these or other factors, we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenue, gross profit and income from operations. Our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our stock, particularly on a short-term basis, and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock. Page 39 Global Economic Uncertainty Our business is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses. This end-user demand has been significantly depressed over the last few quarters and there has been very limited visibility as to the timing of turnaround in demand growth and from which sector this growth will come. A protracted global economic slowdown will continue to exacerbate this issue and may adversely affect our business and results of operation. Semiconductor Equipment Industry Volatility The semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical. The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide. The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict. This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels. When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand. We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles. If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed. We are currently in an industry down cycle. We are not able to predict when the semiconductor industry will recover. During a down cycle, the semiconductor industry typically experiences excess production capacity that causes semiconductor manufacturers to decrease capital spending. We generally do not have long-term volume production contracts with our customers, and we do not control the timing or volume of orders placed by our customers. Whether and to what extent our customers place orders for any specific products, as well as the mix and quantities of products included in those orders, are factors beyond our control. Insufficient orders, especially in our down cycles, will result in under-utilization of our manufacturing facilities and infrastructure and will negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. International Trade and Economic Conditions We serve an increasingly global market. A majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the United States, and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue. Our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region. Because of our significant dependence on international revenue, a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results. Page 40 Managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with, among other things, cultural diversity and organizational alignment. Moreover, each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period. Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues, political instability in regions where we have operations, such as Israel, and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Although we attempt to manage near-term currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate. In addition, our ability to address normal business transaction issues in Asia is at risk due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in Asia, which has resulted in management’s decision to limit travel to Asia in accordance with the World Health Organization’s recommendations. Competition Our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services, some of which compete with the products and service that we offer. These competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services, which we offer, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could negatively affect our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin, and market share, any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. Technological Change and Customer Requirements Success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions. For example, the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices, transition to copper and other new materials, and transition to new 300-millimeter fabs. While we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on our diagnostic products, we cannot ensure that they will directly improve our business. These and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support. Technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards, to develop and introduce new products which successfully address changing customer needs, to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed. Page 41 In this environment, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development. Substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. In addition, we cannot ensure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us. Our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products. Key Suppliers We use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials. We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders, we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing. We seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. Manufacturing Disruption Most of our manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, with a small operation located in Israel. Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. Such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers. We cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if it were available, it could be obtained on favorable terms. Such disruption could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business. Page 42 Intellectual Property Obsolescence and Infringement Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. We own various United States and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our technology that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own, adversely affecting our business. We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. However, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties. While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. We also maintain exclusive and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. As is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry, from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. Our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate. However, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. The inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition. Key Employees Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other employees are difficult to replace. We generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees. Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. The expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain key personnel, or if we are not able to attract, assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future, our business and operations could be harmed. These factors could seriously harm our business. Page 43 Acquisitions In addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources, we also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources. As part of this effort, we may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with the integration of the operations and personnel, technologies and products of the acquired companies, the possible write-downs of impaired assets, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to manage these risks effectively could seriously harm our business. Litigation From time to time we are involved in litigation of various types, including litigation that alleges infringement of intellectual property rights and other claims. Litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms. If we lose in a dispute concerning intellectual property, a court could require us to pay substantial damages and/or royalties or could issue an injunction prohibiting us from using essential technologies. For these and other reasons, this type of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, although we may seek to obtain a license under a third party’s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us, we may not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all. Terrorism and Political Instability The threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business, including the United States, increases the uncertainty in our markets and may delay any recovery in the general economy. Any delay in the recovery of the economy and the semiconductor industry could seriously impact our business. Increased international political instability, as demonstrated by the September 2001 terrorist attacks, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of the terrorist attacks, and the continuing instability in the Middle East, may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations. Such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate. This same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products. If this international political instability continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Earthquake and other uninsured risks We purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks, however, certain other risks that are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant costs are not mitigated via insurance. An earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, most of which are conducted in California. It could also significantly delay our research and engineering effort on new products, most of which is also conducted in California. We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake. We self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is the prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market. Certain other risks are also self insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance. If one or more of the uninsured events occur, we could suffer major financial loss. Page 44 Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements We have adopted Statement No. 143, (“SFAS 143”) “Accounting for Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long-Lived Assets” and Statement No. 144 (“SFAS 144”) “Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS 143 establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost. It also provides guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. SFAS 144 establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. Adoption of these pronouncements did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146 (“SFAS 146”), “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, Liabilities Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This Statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. SFAS 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after March 31, 2003. The standard will in certain circumstances change the timing of recognition of restructuring costs. In November 2002, EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” This issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting. EITF Issue No. 00-21 will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003 or we may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative-effect adjustment. We are reviewing EITF Issue No. 00-21 and have not yet determined the impact this issue will have on our consolidated operating results and financial position. In December 2002, FASB issued SFAS 148, an Amendment of SFAS 123. This Statement amends SFAS 123, to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of that Statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity’s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee compensation. Finally, this Statement amends APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information. Since we are continuing to account for stock- based compensation according to APB 25, our adoption of SFAS 148 requires us to provide prominent disclosures about the effects of SFAS 123 on reported income and requires us to disclose these affects in our interim consolidated financial statements as well. SFAS 148 was effective for interim fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Adoption of this standard had no material impact on our consolidated operating results and financial position. Page 45 In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. We believe that although the adoption of this standard will result in consolidation of certain entities, it will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149 (“SFAS No. 149”), “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly. In particular, this statement clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative, clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component, amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to the language used in FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” and amends certain other existing pronouncements. The provisions of SFAS No. 149, which were not already applied under an Implementation Issue, are effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. We believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150 (“SFAS No. 150”), “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires financial instruments within its scope to be classified as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those financial instruments were previously classified as equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. For financial instruments created before and still existing as of the issuance of this statement, a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle shall be reported upon implementation in the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. We believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations. Page 46 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at June 30, 2003. Actual results may differ materially. At the end of fiscal 2003, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $858 million, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents (detail of these securities is included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2003, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $1 million. As of June 30, 2003, we had net forward contracts to sell $56 million in foreign currency in order to hedge currency exposures (detail of these contracts is incorporated by reference from Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under “Derivative Instruments.” If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2003, the U.S. dollar equivalent would be $55 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $23 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that the hedging of our foreign currency exposure should have no material impact on income or cash flows. Page 47",2023-12-30 20:54:37.419640
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2012,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are as follows:Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. We recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:•When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.•When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due based upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment.•When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.•When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and agreed-upon specifications.•When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.34Table of ContentsService and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.We sell stand-alone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. We periodically review selling prices to determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) exists, and in some situations where we are unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage and customer support requirements. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock.35Table of ContentsContingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 5, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of November 30, 2011 during the three months ended December 31, 2011 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the three months ended December 31, 2011. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the three months ending December 31, 2012.If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 or prior to that, if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance was necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an 36Table of Contentsimpairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.Effects of Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update requiring enhanced disclosure about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The disclosure requirement becomes effective retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2014. We do not expect that the requirement will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature.In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify testing goodwill for impairment. The amendment allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The amendment becomes effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of the three months ended December 31, 2011 (see Note 5, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets,” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). In June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update requiring an increase in the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The amendment eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity and requires that the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendment also required presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented, which was indefinitely deferred by the FASB in December 2011. The amendment (other than the portion regarding the presentation of reclassification adjustments which, as noted above, has been deferred indefinitely) becomes effective during the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. Early adoption is permitted. The amendment will impact the presentation of the financial statements but will not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In May 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update providing guidance on achieving a consistent definition of and common requirements for measurement of fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). This amendment was effective prospectively for our interim reporting period ended March 31, 2012. Early application is not permitted. The amendment did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In April 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on share-based payment awards denominated in certain currencies. The amendment clarifies that an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. This amendment was effective for our interim reporting period ended September 30, 2011. The amendment did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. This guidance now requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance for Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements was effective for our interim reporting period ended March 31, 2010. The implementation did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature. The guidance for Level 3 fair value measurements disclosures was effective for our interim reporting period ended September 30, 2011, and the implementation of that guidance did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature.37Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of products and services primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including the light emitting diode (“LED”), data storage and photovoltaic industries, as well as general materials research.Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and disk manufacturers in the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometric-level manufacturing processes, and to detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers' spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets -- memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers' spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted in favorable long-term revenue growth rates for our process control and yield management solutions. As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that characterizes these industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. In addition, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. The growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. These investments have included process control and yield management equipment and services and have had a significant favorable impact on our revenues.During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, our revenues and earnings remained robust compared to the prior several fiscal years as we responded to meet the high level of customer demand for our products, driven by the strong growth in the consumer mobile device markets. Our revenue levels in the next fiscal year will depend upon whether our customers maintain these elevated levels of investment in process control equipment. In addition to our revenue levels, our earnings for the next fiscal year will also depend on the amount of research and development spending that we embark upon in meeting our customers' technology roadmaps. We cannot predict the duration and sustainability of these favorable business conditions. We have increased our production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges, if business conditions deteriorate. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as to reduce cost. We expect that this in turn will drive long-term increased adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields, reinforcing the longer-term growth drivers in our industry.38Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010Total revenues$3,171,944 $3,175,167 $1,820,760Costs of revenues$1,330,016 $1,259,243 $815,662Gross margin percentage58% 60% 55%Net income$756,015 $794,488 $212,300Diluted income per share$4.44 $4.66 $1.23The results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 reflected favorable conditions we encountered as our customers, particularly the foundries, invested heavily in process control equipment to meet the strong demand driven by the mobile device markets.The results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 reflected improved fundamentals in the semiconductor industry as compared to the prior fiscal year, driven by reduced uncertainty over the global economic environment and continued economic growth in much of Asia. As we increased our business activity levels and shipped more products to our customers during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, we continued to maintain cost discipline, which resulted in improved gross margins as well as net income.Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10Revenues: Product$2,597,755 $2,613,438 $1,324,270 $(15,683) (1)% $1,289,168 97%Service574,189 561,729 496,490 12,460 2 % 65,239 13%Total revenues$3,171,944 $3,175,167 $1,820,760 $(3,223) $1,354,407 Costs of revenues$1,330,016 $1,259,243 $815,662 $70,773 6 % $443,581 54%Gross margin percentage58% 60% 55% (2)% 5% Product revenuesProduct revenues were substantially flat (decreasing by 1%) in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Revenues from sales of our metrology products increased year over year, primarily driven by the adoption of our latest generation products to support advanced patterning lithography and the introduction of 3-D structures in leading edge designs, but that increase was offset by a decrease in defect inspection product revenues due to the timing of customer purchases and reduction in the sale of product upgrades as we transitioned to our next-generation platforms. Each of these twelve-month periods was similarly highlighted by increased volumes of shipment and installation of our products to satisfy customer demand for process control equipment, particularly among foundries, as our customers encountered high levels of demand for semiconductors from electronics end-markets.Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 primarily as a result of increased shipment and acceptance of our products within the year. Many of our customers continued to maintain high levels of capital spending for advanced technology development as well as capacity related investments, resulting in an increase in the number of tools that we sold and revenues that we recognized across each of the three major semiconductor markets (memory, foundry and logic), compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. An increase in the sales of both our defect inspection and metrology equipment contributed to the increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.39Table of ContentsService revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of service revenues is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems. Service revenues increased during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 as a result of an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers' sites, as well as service work completed in the three months ended September 30, 2011 to assist our customers in Japan as their operations recovered from the effects of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for the indicated periods:Year ended June 30,2012 2011 2010Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

Over the past several years, we have embarked on various advanced product development, customer satisfaction improvement and globalization initiatives to improve our competitiveness and gross margins. Over the past eight quarters, our gross margin has generally benefited from the operating efficiencies associated with elevated levels of revenues over that period. The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageFiscal year ended June 30, 201055.2 %Revenue volume of products and service3.9 %Mix of products and services sold(0.1)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies1.6 %Other service and manufacturing costs(0.3)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 201160.3 %Revenue volume of products and service(0.3)%Mix of products and services sold(0.7)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies0.2 %Other service and manufacturing costs(1.4)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 201258.1 %Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin decreased to 58.1% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 from 60.3% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 primarily due to less favorable mix of products and services sold, an increase in revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and an increase in inventory reserves related to product transitions.Our gross margin percentage increased to 60.3% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from 55.2% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to increased demand and revenue from the sale of advanced technology defect inspection and metrology products.Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10R&D expenses$452,937 $386,163 $329,560 $66,774 17% $56,603 17%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues14% 12% 18% 2% (6)% R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $24.8 million as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional engineering headcount, an increase in engineering material costs of $20.3 million for program development related to our next-generation defect inspection products, a decrease in external R&D funding of $11.9 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $5.3 million. 41Table of ContentsR&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $27.8 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and higher variable compensation, an increase in engineering material costs of $24.2 million for program development related to our next-generation defect inspection products and an increase in external services of $9.7 million to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by an increase of $5.1 million in benefit to R&D expense from external funding.R&D expenses include the benefit of $6.9 million, $18.8 million and $13.7 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, for certain strategic development programs, primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase with higher levels of business activity as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products.Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010 FY12 vs. FY11 FY11 vs. FY10SG&A expenses$372,666 $369,431 $361,372 $3,235 1% $8,059 2%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues12% 12% 20% —% (8)% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, primarily due to a decrease in bad debt recovery of $10.7 million, an increase in expenses related to infrastructure of $5.8 million to support current and anticipated business activities and an increase in consulting expenses of $3.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses of $8.8 million, reflecting the resolution of certain litigation matters during the three months ended March 31, 2012, and a decrease in employee-related expenses of $8.2 million as a result of lower variable compensation. SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses of $37.0 million as a result of additional headcount to support higher sales volume and higher variable compensation, partially offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges of $13.4 million, a decrease in legal expenses of $9.1 million related to our historical stock option practices and certain indemnification obligations, and an increase in bad debt recovery of $6.7 million.Interest Income and Other, Net and Interest Expense Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010Interest income and other, net$11,966 $4,064 $31,532Interest expense$54,197 $54,328 $54,517Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues—% —% 2%Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues2% 2% 3%Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, and interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations). The increase in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of $6.9 million for equity investments in privately-held companies and a decrease of $4.1 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions. 42Table of ContentsThe decrease in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges of $6.8 million for equity investments in privately-held companies and an international tax reserve benefit of $15.9 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitations relating to an uncertainty in our position with respect to a foreign transaction-based tax during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to no tax reserve benefit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: (Dollar amounts in thousands)Year ended June 30, 2012 2011 2010Income before income taxes$974,094 $1,110,066 $291,181Provision for income taxes$218,079 $315,578 $78,881Effective tax rate22.4% 28.4% 27.1%The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates and tax credits, offset by state taxes, the tax effects of employee stock activity and other factors. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was 22.4% compared to 28.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Tax expense decreased primarily from a decrease in state tax expense, a decrease in tax reserves, and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was 28.4% compared to 27.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Tax expense increased primarily from an increase in state tax expense, a decrease in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, and an increase in tax reserves, offset by a decrease in the effect of shortfalls from employee stock activity.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.We incurred $11.9 million and $15.2 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, due to shortfalls from employee stock activity. Windfall tax benefits arise when a company's tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may continue to exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity, and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result. Because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013, we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year.In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.43Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2012 2011 2010Cash and cash equivalents$751,294 $711,329 $529,918Marketable securities1,783,150 1,327,206 1,004,126Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,534,444 $2,038,535 $1,534,044Percentage of total assets50% 44% 39% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2012 2011 2010Net cash provided by operating activities$941,617 $823,166 $447,800Net cash used in investing activities(528,891) (359,510) (227,964)Net cash used in financing activities(364,103) (300,155) (216,331)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(8,658) 17,910 1,446Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$39,965 $181,411 $4,951As of June 30, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.5 billion, which is an increase of $496 million from June 30, 2011. As of June 30, 2012, $888 million of our $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to permanently reinvest approximately $673 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated. We have accrued (but have not paid) U.S. taxes on the remaining cash of $215 million of the $888 million held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $234 million, $167 million and $102 million, respectively. The increase in the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the preceding fiscal years reflected an increase during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 to the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.25 to $0.35 per share. On July 10, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.35 to $0.40 per share.The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. The decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In October 2008, we suspended our stock repurchase program, and we subsequently restarted the program in February 2010.We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. 44Table of ContentsFiscal Year 2012 Compared to Fiscal Year 2011Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from $823 million to $942 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•A decrease in tax payments of approximately $240 million, which includes a tax refund of $40 million and a change in the timing of when revenue is recognized for federal income tax purposes, resulting in lower tax payments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. We expect that tax payments in future periods will increase to normal amounts relative to our profit before taxes. This decrease in tax payments was partially offset by•A decrease in cash collections of approximately $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 and•An increase in payroll expenses of approximately $95 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, mainly due to increases in employee headcount.Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from $360 million to $529 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $147 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from $300 million to $364 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in dividend payments of $66 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in July 2011, and•An increase in common stock repurchases of $29 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, partially offset by•An increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $39 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Fiscal Year 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year 2010Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $448 million to $823 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in cash collections of approximately $1.4 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, due to higher sales volume, partially offset by•An increase in vendor payments of approximately $580 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, to support a higher level of business activities,•An increase in payroll expenses of approximately $170 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to bonus payments for fiscal year 2010 (which were paid during fiscal year 2011) and higher headcount, and•An increase in tax payments of approximately $270 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, due to higher profitability.Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $228 million to $360 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $124 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.45Table of ContentsNet cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $216 million to $300 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in dividend payments of $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in July 2010, and•An increase in common stock repurchases of $99 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to the temporary suspension of our stock repurchase program from October 2008 to February 2010 due to market conditions, partially offset by•An increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $89 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.Contractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2012: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 and thereafter OtherLong-term debt obligations(1)$750,000 $— $— $— $— $— $750,000 $—Interest expense associated with long-term debt obligations301,875 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 43,125 —Purchase commitments308,209 296,455 7,777 3,970 7 — — —Non-current income tax payable(2)55,430 — — — — — — 55,430Operating leases24,400 8,537 5,618 2,998 2,748 2,314 2,185 —Pension obligations31,126 2,473 2,014 3,040 2,466 2,736 18,397 —Total contractual cash obligations$1,471,040 $359,215 $67,159 $61,758 $56,971 $56,800 $813,707 $55,430 __________________ (1)In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018.(2)Represents the non-current income tax payable obligation and related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2012 2011 2010Receivables sold under factoring agreements$368,894 $313,578 $107,666Proceeds from sales of LCs$30,142 $140,534 $37,226 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in interest income and other, net and were not material for the periods presented.46Table of ContentsWe maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $20.2 million, of which $18.2 million had been issued as of June 30, 2012, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. We maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $308 million as of June 30, 2012 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Working capital increased to $3.3 billion as of June 30, 2012, compared to $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2011. This increase is primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities as we generated significant cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, as well as higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory that resulted from supporting elevated levels of business activities, which was partially offset by cash payments relating to our stock repurchases and dividend programs. As of June 30, 2012, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.Our credit ratings and outlooks as of July 9, 2012 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRating OutlookFitchBBB StableMoody’sBaa1 StableStandard & Poor’sBBB StableFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy.47Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 18 months, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2012 2011Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase$14,689 $3,381Sell$29,362 $30,133Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$121,965 $174,499Sell$126,827 $216,738Indemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement by our products of third-party intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.48Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2012. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2012, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.8 billion, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2012, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $1.5 million.As of June 30, 2012, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $19.5 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2012, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $20.0 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $18.4 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows.In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2012, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $746.8 million and $902.2 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2011, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $746.3 million and $863.5 million, respectively.49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:54.327260
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2013,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are as follows:Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. In general, we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. When a customer delays installation for delivered products for which we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue upon shipment, prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:•When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.•When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due based upon shipment.•When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.•When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.In circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured. 35Table of ContentsWe sell stand-alone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. We periodically review selling prices to determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) exists, and in some situations where we are unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements, such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for 12 months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock.Accounting for Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation. Cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards issued to employees under our Cash LTI program vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. Compensation expense related to the Cash LTI awards is recognized over the vesting term, which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures. 36Table of ContentsContingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 5, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of November 30, 2012 during the three months ended December 31, 2012 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the three months ended December 31, 2012. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the three months ending December 31, 2013.If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. 37Table of ContentsValuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.Effects of Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update requiring an increase in the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The amendment eliminated the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity and required that total comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income be presented in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendment became effective for our interim period ended September 30, 2012. In February 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income of various components, which was originally deferred by the FASB in December 2011. The February 2013 update does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, this update requires an entity to present parenthetically (on the face of the financial statements, in the notes or, in some cases, cross-referenced to related footnote disclosures) significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. The amendment reflected in the February 2013 update becomes effective prospectively in the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year ending June 30, 2014. Early adoption is permitted. The amendment reflected in the February 2013 update will not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature.In December 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update requiring enhanced disclosure about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The disclosure requirement becomes effective retrospectively in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2014. We do not expect that the requirement will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature.In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify testing goodwill for impairment. The amendment allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The amendment, by its terms, became effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, and early adoption was permitted. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of the three months ended December 31, 2011 (see Note 5, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets,” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description).EXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including the light emitting diode (“LED”) and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. 38Table of ContentsOur products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and disk manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometric-level manufacturing processes, and to detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers' spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets -- memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers' spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions. As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that characterizes these industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. In addition, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. As our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings.However, in addition to these trends of cyclicality and consolidation, the semiconductor industry has also been significantly impacted by constant technological innovation. The growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. These investments have included process control and yield management equipment and services and have had a significant favorable impact on our revenues over the long term.Over the past three years, we experienced high levels of customer demand for our products, driven by the strong growth in increasingly sophisticated mobile devices incorporating advanced ICs. Our revenue levels in the next fiscal year will depend upon whether our customers maintain these levels of investment in process control equipment. Our earnings for the next fiscal year will depend not only on our revenue levels, but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers' technology roadmaps. We cannot predict the duration and sustainability of the recent favorable business conditions. We have continued to scale our production volumes and capacity to meet customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges, if business conditions deteriorate. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as to reduce cost. We expect that this in turn will drive long-term increased adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields, reinforcing the longer-term growth drivers in our industry.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2013 2012 2011Total revenues$2,842,781 $3,171,944 $3,175,167Costs of revenues$1,237,452 $1,330,016 $1,259,243Gross margin percentage56% 58% 60%Net income$543,149 $756,015 $794,488Diluted income per share$3.21 $4.44 $4.66Revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 reflected typical cyclicality in capacity-oriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers, as well as delays in the procurement of next-generation equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography.The results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011 reflected the favorable conditions that we encountered as our customers, particularly the foundries, invested heavily in process control equipment to meet the strong demand driven by the mobile device markets and continued economic growth in Asia. 39Table of ContentsRevenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2013 2012 2011 FY13 vs. FY12 FY12 vs. FY11Revenues: Product$2,247,147 $2,597,755 $2,613,438 $(350,608) (13)% $(15,683) (1)%Service595,634 574,189 561,729 21,445 4 % 12,460 2 %Total revenues$2,842,781 $3,171,944 $3,175,167 $(329,163) $(3,223) Costs of revenues$1,237,452 $1,330,016 $1,259,243 $(92,564) (7)% $70,773 6 %Gross margin percentage56% 58% 60% (2)% (2)% Product revenuesOur business is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers, with revenues impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, due to the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding periods.Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as a result of a decline in overall semiconductor industry capital spending. Revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products reflected typical cyclicality in capacity-oriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers, as well as delays in the procurement of next-generation equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography. Product revenues were substantially flat (decreasing by 1%) in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Revenues from sales of our metrology products increased year over year, primarily driven by the adoption of our latest-generation products to support advanced patterning lithography and the introduction of 3-D structures in leading edge designs, but that increase was offset by a decrease in defect inspection product revenues due to the timing of customer purchases and lower sales of product upgrades as we transitioned to our next-generation platforms. Each of these twelve-month periods was similarly highlighted by high volumes of shipment and installation of our products to satisfy customer demand for process control equipment, particularly among foundries, as our customers encountered high levels of demand for semiconductors from electronics end-markets.Service revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of service revenues is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems. Service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended June 30 2011, 2012 and 2013 as a result of an increase over that time period in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers' sites.

The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageFiscal year ended June 30, 201160.3 %Revenue volume of products and service(0.3)%Mix of products and services sold(0.7)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies0.2 %Other service and manufacturing costs(1.4)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 201258.1 %Revenue volume of products and service(1.9)%Mix of products and services sold0.4 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies(0.1)%Other service and manufacturing costs— %Fiscal year ended June 30, 201356.5 %Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin decreased to 56.5% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from 58.1% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 primarily due to lower revenue volume, partially offset by more favorable mix of products and manufacturing efficiencies.Our gross margin percentage decreased to 58.1% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 from 60.3% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 primarily due to less favorable mix of products and services sold, an increase in revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and an increase in inventory reserves related to product transitions. 41Table of ContentsEngineering, Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2013 2012 2011 FY13 vs. FY12 FY12 vs. FY11R&D expenses$487,832 $452,937 $386,163 $34,895 8% $66,774 17%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues17% 14% 12% 3% 2% In recent years, our R&D expenses have generally increased over time, primarily due to higher costs associated with advanced product and technology development projects. We incur significant costs associated with these projects, including engineering material costs, headcount and other expenses, as technological innovation is essential to our success. During certain periods, R&D expenses may fluctuate relative to product development phases and project timing.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to the stage and timing of our development projects, as described in the previous paragraph. R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were impacted by an increase in engineering material and depreciation of $26.1 million and an increase in employee-related expenses of $9.0 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and annual compensation adjustments. R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $24.8 million as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional engineering headcount, an increase in engineering material costs of $20.3 million for program development related to our next-generation defect inspection products, a decrease in external R&D funding of $11.9 million and an increase in depreciation expense of $5.3 million.R&D expenses include the benefit of $12.4 million, $6.9 million and $18.8 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for certain strategic development programs, primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase with higher levels of business activity as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products.Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2013 2012 2011 FY13 vs. FY12 FY12 vs. FY11SG&A expenses$387,812 $372,666 $369,431 $15,146 4% $3,235 1%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues14% 12% 12% 2% —% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to an increase of $5.7 million in support costs related to product demonstrations and evaluations of our product by customers, as well as depreciation expense, an increase of $3.6 million in travel expense due to the increasingly global nature of our customers, operations and business, an increase of $2.1 million in employee-related compensation as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional headcount and $3.1 million in goodwill impairment, severance and other expenses that we recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2012 in connection with our decision to exit from the solar inspection business. SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 were slightly higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, primarily due to a decrease in bad debt recovery of $10.7 million, an increase in expenses related to infrastructure of $5.8 million to support current and anticipated business activities and an increase in consulting expenses of $3.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses of $8.8 million, reflecting the resolution of certain litigation matters during the three months ended March 31, 2012, and a decrease in employee-related expenses of $8.2 million as a result of lower variable compensation. 42Table of ContentsInterest Income and Other, Net and Interest Expense Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2013 2012 2011Interest income and other, net$15,112 $11,966 $4,064Interest expense$54,176 $54,197 $54,328Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues1% —% —%Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues2% 2% 2%Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, and interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations). The increase in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of $2.9 million for equity investments in privately-held companies, an increase in realized gains of marketable securities of $1.2 million and an increase in foreign exchange related gains of $1.9 million, partially offset by an increase of $4.2 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions. The increase in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of $6.9 million for equity investments in privately-held companies and a decrease of $4.1 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: (Dollar amounts in thousands)Year ended June 30, 2013 2012 2011Income before income taxes$690,621 $974,094 $1,110,066Provision for income taxes$147,472 $218,079 $315,578Effective tax rate21.4% 22.4% 28.4%The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates, the tax effects of employee stock activity, tax credits and state taxes. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 was 21.4% compared to 22.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the tax effects of employee stock activity, an increase in tax credits and an increase in the domestic manufacturing benefit, offset by an increase in tax reserves. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was 22.4% compared to 28.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. Tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in state tax expense, a decrease in tax reserves, and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. 43Table of ContentsWe had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately $6.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. We incurred $11.9 million and $15.2 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, due to shortfalls from employee stock activity. Windfall tax benefits arise when a company's tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity, and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result. Because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year.In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2013 2012 2011Cash and cash equivalents$985,390 $751,294 $711,329Marketable securities1,933,491 1,783,150 1,327,206Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,918,881 $2,534,444 $2,038,535Percentage of total assets55% 50% 44% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2013 2012 2011Net cash provided by operating activities$913,188 $941,617 $823,166Net cash used in investing activities(241,447) (528,891) (359,510)Net cash used in financing activities(428,510) (364,103) (300,155)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(9,135) (8,658) 17,910Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$234,096 $39,965 $181,411As of June 30, 2013, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.9 billion, which is an increase of $384 million from June 30, 2012. As of June 30, 2013, $1.1 billion of our $2.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to permanently reinvest $939 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated. We have accrued (but have not paid) U.S. taxes on the remaining cash of $203 million of the $1.1 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $266 million, $234 million and $167 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the preceding fiscal years reflects the increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.35 to $0.40 per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2012. On July 9, 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.45 per share.The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. The decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 44Table of ContentsWe have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Fiscal Year 2013 Compared to Fiscal Year 2012Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 from $942 million to $913 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in tax payments of approximately $101 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 due to a change in the timing of when revenue is recognized for federal income tax purposes that resulted in lower tax payments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and •A decrease in cash collections of approximately $61 million primarily due to lower revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, partially offset by•A decrease in accounts payable payments of approximately $116 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 from $529 million to $241 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $305 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 from $364 million to $429 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in dividend payments of $32 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in July 2012, •An increase in common stock repurchases of $9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, and•A decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $39 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.

In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2013 2012 2011Receivables sold under factoring agreements$144,307 $368,894 $313,578Proceeds from sales of LCs$3,808 $30,142 $140,534 46Table of ContentsFactoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in interest income and other, net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $25.5 million, of which $23.3 million had been issued as of June 30, 2013, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. We maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $248 million as of June 30, 2013 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hours per week coverage for 12 months. See Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Working capital increased to $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2013, compared to $3.3 billion as of June 30, 2012. This increase is primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities as we generated significant cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, as well as higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory that resulted from supporting elevated levels of business activity, which was partially offset by cash payments relating to our stock repurchases and dividend programs. As of June 30, 2013, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $2.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.Our credit ratings and outlooks as of June 30, 2013 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRating OutlookFitchBBB StableMoody’sBaa1 StableStandard & Poor’sBBB StableFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. 47Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 18 months, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2013 2012Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase$14,641 $14,689Sell$35,178 $29,362Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$99,175 $121,965Sell$97,901 $126,827Indemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement by our products of third-party intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 48Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2013. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2013, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.9 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2013, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $1.8 million.As of June 30, 2013, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $19.3 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2013, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $17.4 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $18.3 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows.In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior, unsecured long-term debt due in 2018. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2013, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $747.4 million and $872.3 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $746.8 million and $902.2 million, respectively.See Note 4, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2013. 49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:50.818208
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2014,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. In general, we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. When a customer delays installation for delivered products for which we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:•When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.•When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due based upon shipment.•When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.•When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.In circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.In many instances, products are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts. We also allow for multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. To determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy. For substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, we use vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third-party evidence (“TPE”) to allocate the selling price to each deliverable. We determine TPE based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis. When we are unable to establish relative selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (“ESP”) in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. ESP could potentially be used for new or customized products. We regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. In a multiple element revenue arrangement, we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer. To be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting, which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and (b) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. If the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer. 35Table of ContentsTrade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.We sell stand-alone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. We periodically review selling prices to determine whether VSOE exists, and in some situations where we are unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements, such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for 12 months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to such customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. 36Table of ContentsAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. The fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). We have elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs.Accounting for Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation. Cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards issued to employees under our Cash LTI program vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. Compensation expense related to the Cash LTI awards is recognized over the vesting term, which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures.Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 14, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year 2014 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015.If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations. 37Table of ContentsIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently AdoptedIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued an accounting standard update requiring enhanced disclosure about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. We adopted the disclosure requirement in the first quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, and it did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income of various components, which was originally deferred by the FASB in December 2011. The February 2013 update did not change the then current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, this update required an entity to present parenthetically (on the face of the financial statements, in the notes or, in some cases, cross-referenced to related footnote disclosures) significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. The amendment reflected in the February 2013 update was adopted by us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, and it did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it was disclosure-only in nature. 38Table of ContentsUpdates Not Yet EffectiveIn July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. Under the new standard update, in most circumstances, an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in a company's financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. This accounting standard update will be effective for our interim period ending September 30, 2014 and applied prospectively with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate that this accounting standard update will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or non-financial assets, unless the contracts are covered by other standards (for example, insurance or lease contracts). Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The updates are effective for us beginning the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding stock-based compensation that clarifies the accounting when terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting which could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The update is effective for us beginning the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, primarily supports IC manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including LED and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and disk manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometric-level manufacturing processes, and to detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers' spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets -- memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers' spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions. As we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. As our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. In addition, we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. 39Table of ContentsHowever, in addition to these trends of consolidation and cyclicality, the semiconductor industry has also been significantly impacted by constant technological innovation. The growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. These investments have included process control and yield management equipment and services and have had a significant favorable impact on our revenues over the long term. Over the past four years, we have experienced high levels of customer demand for our products, a result of growth in increasingly sophisticated mobile devices incorporating advanced ICs. The demand for our products is driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate these advanced ICs. We cannot predict the duration and sustainability of the recent favorable business conditions, and our revenue levels in the next fiscal year will depend upon whether our customers maintain recent levels of investment in process control equipment. Our earnings for the next fiscal year will depend not only on our revenue levels, but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers' technology roadmaps. We have continued to scale our production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as to reduce cost. We expect, particularly among our foundry and logic customers, that this in turn will drive high levels of long-term adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields, reinforcing the longer-term growth drivers in our industry.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2014 2013 2012Total revenues$2,929,408 $2,842,781 $3,171,944Costs of revenues$1,232,962 $1,237,452 $1,330,016Gross margin percentage58% 56% 58%Net income$582,755 $543,149 $756,015Diluted income per share$3.47 $3.21 $4.44Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 increased by 3% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, as our customers continued to invest in process control and services to improve manufacturing yields as they adopt advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules required to fabricate advanced ICs.Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 reflected typical cyclicality in capacity-oriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers, as well as delays in the procurement of next-generation equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography.Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2014 2013 2012 FY14 vs. FY13 FY13 vs. FY12Revenues: Product$2,286,437 $2,247,147 $2,597,755 $39,290 2 % $(350,608) (13)%Service642,971 595,634 574,189 47,337 8 % 21,445 4 %Total revenues$2,929,408 $2,842,781 $3,171,944 $86,627 3 % $(329,163) (10)%Costs of revenues$1,232,962 $1,237,452 $1,330,016 $(4,490) — % $(92,564) (7)%Gross margin percentage58% 56% 58% 2% (2)% Product revenuesOur business is affected by the increasingly concentrated nature of our semiconductor manufacturer customer base and the cyclicality of the capital equipment procurement practices of those manufacturers, with revenues directly impacted by their investment patterns. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, due to the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding periods. 40Table of ContentsProduct revenues increased by 2% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, as our customers increased their investments in defect inspection capabilities to address the yield challenges caused by the introduction of new technologies and architectures, and added production capacity to meet the growing needs for advanced ICs demanded in an environment of rising global demand for mobile devices.Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as a result of a decline in overall semiconductor industry capital spending. Revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products reflected typical cyclicality in capacity-oriented capital spending by logic and memory chip manufacturers, as well as delays in the procurement of next-generation equipment required to facilitate the transition to extreme ultraviolet lithography. Service revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, 2013 and 2014 as a result of an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers' sites over that time period.

It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin increased to 57.9% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 from 56.5% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 primarily due to lower charges for inventory obsolescence as well as manufacturing and service efficiencies, partially offset by a less favorable mix of products and services sold.Our gross margin decreased to 56.5% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from 58.1% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 primarily due to lower revenue volume, partially offset by a more favorable mix of products and certain manufacturing efficiencies.Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2014 2013 2012 FY14 vs. FY13 FY13 vs. FY12R&D expenses$539,469 $487,832 $452,937 $51,637 11% $34,895 8%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues18% 17% 14% 1% 3% Our R&D expenses have generally increased over time, including significant increases over the past two fiscal years primarily due to higher costs associated with advanced product and technology development projects. We incur significant costs associated with these projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses, as technological innovation is essential to our success. During certain periods, R&D expenses may fluctuate relative to product development phases and project timing.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $41.8 million as a result of hiring additional engineering talent and an increase in travel expenses of $2.6 million, as well as a $4.2 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of R&D activities.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to the stage and timing of our development projects, as described above. R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were impacted by an increase in engineering material and depreciation of $26.1 million and an increase in employee-related expenses of $9.0 million as a result of additional engineering headcount. 42Table of ContentsR&D expenses include the benefit of $8.2 million, $12.4 million and $6.9 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, for certain strategic development programs, primarily from government grants. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2014 2013 2012 FY14 vs. FY13 FY13 vs. FY12SG&A expenses$384,907 $387,812 $372,666 $(2,905) (1)% $15,146 4%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues13% 14% 12% (1)% 2% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were slightly lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, primarily due to lower levels of consulting expenses of $4.5 million and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $2.6 million as some intangible assets became fully amortized. This was partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $4.4 million as a result of hiring additional personnel.SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to an increase of $5.7 million in support costs related to product demonstrations and evaluations of our product by customers, as well as depreciation expense, an increase of $3.6 million in travel expenses due to the increasingly global nature of our customers, operations and business, an increase of $2.1 million in employee-related compensation as a result of annual compensation adjustments and additional headcount and $3.1 million in goodwill impairment, severance and other expenses that we recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2012 in connection with our decision to exit from the solar inspection business. Interest Income and Other, Net and Interest Expense Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2014 2013 2012Interest income and other, net$16,203 $15,112 $11,966Interest expense$53,812 $54,176 $54,197Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues1% 1% —%Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues2% 2% 2%Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, and interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations). The increase in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.7 million from the sale of an equity investment in a privately-held company, partially offset by an impairment charge of $1.4 million recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2013 related to an equity investment in a privately-held company that was deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment and a decrease in interest income of $1.3 million driven by lower interest rates.The increase in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was primarily attributable to a decrease in impairment charges of $2.9 million for equity investments in privately-held companies, an increase in realized gains of marketable securities of $1.2 million and an increase in foreign exchange related gains of $1.9 million, partially offset by an increase of $4.2 million in interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. 43Table of ContentsProvision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes:(Dollar amounts in thousands)Year ended June 30, 2014 2013 2012Income before income taxes$734,461 $690,621 $974,094Provision for income taxes$151,706 $147,472 $218,079Effective tax rate20.7% 21.4% 22.4%The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates, the tax effects of employee stock activity, tax credits and state taxes. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 was 20.7% compared to 21.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in tax reserves and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, partially offset by a decrease in our research and development credits and an increase in tax expense related to employee stock activity. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 was 21.4% compared to 22.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. Tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the tax effects of employee stock activity, an increase in tax credits and an increase in the domestic manufacturing benefit, offset by an increase in tax reserves.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.We had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately $23.4 million and $6.9 million during each of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. We incurred $11.9 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012, due to shortfalls from employee stock activity. Windfall tax benefits arise when a company's tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, we do not expect shortfalls from employee stock activity to have an impact on our tax rate, because we do not expect shortfalls to be in excess of cumulative windfalls.In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. 44Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2014 2013 2012Cash and cash equivalents$630,861 $985,390 $751,294Marketable securities2,521,776 1,933,491 1,783,150Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$3,152,637 $2,918,881 $2,534,444Percentage of total assets57% 55% 50% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2014 2013 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$778,886 $913,188 $941,617Net cash used in investing activities(676,109) (241,447) (528,891)Net cash used in financing activities(458,887) (428,510) (364,103)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents1,581 (9,135) (8,658)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(354,529) $234,096 $39,965As of June 30, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.2 billion, which is an increase of $234 million from June 30, 2013. As of June 30, 2014, $1.3 billion of our $3.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to permanently reinvest $1.1 billion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated. We have accrued (but have not paid) U.S. taxes on the remaining cash of $152 million of the $1.3 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $299 million, $266 million and $234 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the preceding fiscal year reflects the increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.45 per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2013. On July 8, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.45 to $0.50 per share.On July 8, 2014, we also announced that our Board of Directors had authorized us to repurchase up to 13 million additional shares under our stock repurchase program. The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. The decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Fiscal Year 2014 Compared to Fiscal Year 2013Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from $913 million to $779 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in payroll of approximately $44 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, •An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $39 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013,•An increase in tax payments of approximately $19 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, and•Payments of approximately $15 million upon vesting of cash-based long-term incentive (""Cash LTI"") awards during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 under our Cash LTI employee compensation plan, whereas no such payments occurred during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. 45Table of ContentsNet cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from $241 million to $676 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $424 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. In addition, we acquired a privately-held company for a total purchase consideration of $18 million in cash during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from $429 million to $459 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in dividend payments of $33 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in July 2013, and •A decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $14 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, partially offset by•A decrease in common stock repurchases of $32 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.Fiscal Year 2013 Compared to Fiscal Year 2012Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 from $942 million to $913 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in tax payments of approximately $101 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 due to a change in the timing of when revenue is recognized for federal income tax purposes that resulted in lower tax payments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and •A decrease in cash collections of approximately $61 million primarily due to lower revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, partially offset by•A decrease in accounts payable payments of approximately $116 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 from $529 million to $241 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $305 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 from $364 million to $429 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in dividend payments of $32 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in July 2012, •An increase in common stock repurchases of $9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, and•A decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $39 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. 46Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2014: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 and thereafter OtherLong-term debt obligations(1)$750,000 $— $— $— $750,000 $— $— $—Interest payment associated with long-term debt obligations198,375 51,750 51,750 51,750 43,125 — — —Purchase commitments214,355 212,032 2,323 — — — — —Non-current income taxes payable(2)66,247 — — — — — — 66,247Operating leases27,637 8,619 6,757 5,082 3,613 1,744 1,822 —Cash long-term incentive program (3)108,967 30,853 30,853 30,853 16,408 — — —Pension obligations24,934 1,700 1,635 1,532 1,969 1,853 16,245(4) —Total contractual cash obligations$1,390,515 $304,954 $93,318 $89,217 $815,115 $3,597 $18,067 $66,247 __________________ (1)In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018.(2)Represents the non-current income taxes payable obligation and related accrued interest.

Expected payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately $90 million.(4)Represents benefits expected to be paid in fiscal years 2020 through 2024.Starting in fiscal year 2013 we adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. In order to receive payments under the Cash LTI Plan, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2014 2013 2012Receivables sold under factoring agreements$116,292 $144,307 $368,894Proceeds from sales of LCs$8,323 $3,808 $30,142 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in interest income and other, net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $28.4 million, of which $26.3 million had been issued as of June 30, 2014, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. 47Table of ContentsWe maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $214.3 million as of June 30, 2014 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hours per week coverage for 12 months. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Working capital increased to $3.7 billion as of June 30, 2014, compared to $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2013. This increase is primarily due to higher levels of cash and marketable securities as we generated significant cash flow from operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, as well as a higher level of inventory that resulted from supporting elevated levels of business activity. As of June 30, 2014, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $3.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.Our credit ratings and outlooks as of June 30, 2014 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRating OutlookFitchBBB StableMoody’sBaa1 StableStandard & Poor’sBBB+ StableFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. 48Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 18 months, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2014 2013Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase$6,066 $14,641Sell$33,999 $35,178Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$108,901 $99,175Sell$106,322 $97,901Indemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights used in our products and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us. In addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific pricing, discount, rebate or credit commitments offered by us. Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. To date, we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future. One significant customer recently exercised its audit rights, but we cannot predict the outcome of that audit at this time.It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 49Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2014. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2014, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $2.7 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2014, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $1.4 million.In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior, unsecured long-term debt due in 2018. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2014, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $747.9 million and $893.7 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2013, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $747.4 million and $872.3 million, respectively.See Note 4, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2014.As of June 30, 2014, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $25.4 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2014, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $25.6 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $17.5 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows. 50Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:41.030791
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2015,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. In general, we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. When we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:•When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.•When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due based upon shipment.•When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.•When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.In circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.In many instances, products are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts. We have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. To determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy. For substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, we use vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third-party evidence (“TPE”) to allocate the selling price to each deliverable. We determine TPE based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis. When we are unable to establish relative selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (“ESP”) in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. ESP could potentially be used for new or customized products. We regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. In a multiple element revenue arrangement, we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer. To be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting, which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and (b) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. If the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer.Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right. 37Table of ContentsSpare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.We sell stand-alone software that is subject to the software revenue recognition guidance. We periodically review selling prices to determine whether VSOE exists, and in situations where we are unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements, such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for 12 months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to such customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a regular basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. 38Table of ContentsStock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. We have elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs.Accounting for Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation. Cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards issued to employees under our Cash LTI program vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. Compensation expense related to the Cash LTI awards is recognized over the vesting term, which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures.Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 14, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable. 39Table of ContentsOn a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently AdoptedIn July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update that provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. Under this accounting standard update, in most circumstances, an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in our financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. This accounting standard update became effective for our interim period ended September 30, 2014, and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding stock-based compensation that clarifies the accounting treatment when terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period ends. The update requires that a performance target that affects vesting that could be achieved after the requisite service period ends be treated as a performance condition. The update is effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting standards update regarding simplification of the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. Earlier adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued and we are required to apply the guidance on a retrospective basis with additional disclosure requirements upon transition. We early adopted this accounting standard update in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 40Table of ContentsUpdates Not Yet EffectiveIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or non-financial assets, unless the contracts are covered by other standards (for example, insurance or lease contracts). Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The updates are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. In July 2015, the FASB announced a deferral of the effective date by one year, with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for customer’s cloud based fees. The guidance changes what a customer must consider in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license, the customer would account for the fees related to the software license element in accordance with guidance related to internal use software; if the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for the subsequent measurement of inventory. The amended guidance requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation and the accounting guidance is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) or the retail inventory method. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, with early adoption permitted to be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including the LED and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and disk manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets - memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions, particularly in the foundry and logic markets, which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market. 41Table of ContentsAs we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. As our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. We are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. The semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation. The growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices in mobile consumer products has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. On the other hand, higher design costs for the most advanced ICs could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment, although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ICs, reuse of installed products, and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes.The demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ICs that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices. The timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers’ requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules, and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand. Our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels, but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers’ technology roadmaps. We have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate. Over the past year, our customers have taken delivery of lower volumes of process control equipment that we had expected. Any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility, due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition due to expiration of credits or volume discounts, which, if not used by a stipulated time frame, will expire. During the most recent quarter, we implemented a plan to reduce our global employee workforce aimed at streamlining our organization and business processes in response to the changing customer requirements in our industry. The goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. We expect to substantially complete the global employee workforce reduction by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, but certain reductions will occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2015 2014 2013Total revenues$2,814,049 $2,929,408 $2,842,781Costs of revenues$1,215,229 $1,232,962 $1,237,452Gross margin percentage57% 58% 56%Net income$366,158 $582,755 $543,149Diluted income per share$2.24 $3.47 $3.21Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 decreased by 4% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. Revenue decreases from sales of both our defect inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 reflected our customers’ decline in capital spending for process control equipment, due to shifts in the timing of the new technology ramps and capacity-related expansion plans.Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 increased by 3% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, as our customers continued to invest in process control and services to improve manufacturing yields as they adopt advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules required to fabricate advanced ICs. 42Table of ContentsRevenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2015 2014 2013 FY15 vs. FY14 FY14 vs. FY13Revenues: Product$2,125,396 $2,286,437 $2,247,147 $(161,041) (7)% $39,290 2 %Service688,653 642,971 595,634 45,682 7 % 47,337 8 %Total revenues$2,814,049 $2,929,408 $2,842,781 $(115,359) (4)% $86,627 3 %Costs of revenues$1,215,229 $1,232,962 $1,237,452 $(17,733) (1)% $(4,490) — %Gross margin percentage57% 58% 56% (1)% 2% Product revenuesOur business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period.Product revenues decreased by 7% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, primarily as a result of lower revenues from our customers in Taiwan, certain countries in Asia and Europe and Israel, partially offset by higher revenues from our customers in North America, Korea and Japan. The decline in revenues was impacted by the timing of development and new technology ramps of our customers as well as the lower shipments of our products, particularly to our foundry customers in Taiwan, due to timing of capacity-related expansion plans.Product revenues increased by 2% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, as our customers increased their investments in defect inspection capabilities to address the yield challenges caused by the introduction of new technologies and architectures, and added production capacity to meet the growing needs for advanced ICs demanded in an environment of rising global demand for mobile devices.Service revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015, primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over that time period.Revenues - Top CustomersThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the indicated periods:Year ended June 30,2015 2014 2013Intel Corporation Intel Corporation Intel CorporationSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageFiscal year ended June 30, 201356.5 %Revenue volume of products and services— %Mix of products and services sold(0.3)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies0.2 %Other service and manufacturing costs1.5 %Fiscal year ended June 30, 201457.9 %Revenue volume of products and services(1.1)%Mix of products and services sold0.3 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies(0.6)%Other service and manufacturing costs0.3 %Fiscal year ended June 30, 201556.8 %Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin decreased to 56.8% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 from 57.9% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to lower volume of products and services, as well as a reduction in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower manufacturing output and severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, refer to Note 15, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details. The above decreases were partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services sold and efficiencies derived from other service and manufacturing costs. 44Table of ContentsOur gross margin increased to 57.9% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 from 56.5% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, primarily due to lower charges for inventory obsolescence as well as manufacturing and service efficiencies, partially offset by a less favorable mix of products and services sold.Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2015 2014 2013 FY15 vs. FY14 FY14 vs. FY13R&D expenses$530,616 $539,469 $487,832 $(8,853) (2)% $51,637 11%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues19% 18% 17% 1% 1% R&D expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused R&D efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy. Historically, our R&D expenses have generally increased over time, primarily due to higher costs associated with advanced product and technology development projects. We incur significant costs associated with these projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses, as technological innovation is essential to our success. One of the goals of our plan to reduce our global employee workforce is to streamline our organization and business processes and direct our resources toward our best opportunities.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in engineering materials and consulting costs of $19.8 million associated with the completion of major platform developments, a decrease in depreciation expense of $2.1 million and a decrease in travel expenses of $1.2 million. This was partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $10.6 million mainly as a result of our severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, refer to Note 15, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details. In addition, the decrease was partially offset by a $6.3 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of R&D activities.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $41.8 million as a result of hiring additional engineering talent and an increase in travel expenses of $2.6 million, as well as a $4.2 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of R&D activities.R&D expenses include the benefit of $1.9 million, $8.2 million and $12.4 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for certain strategic development programs, primarily from government grants. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. 45Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2015 2014 2013 FY15 vs. FY14 FY14 vs. FY13SG&A expenses$406,864 $384,907 $387,812 $21,957 6% $(2,905) (1)%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues14% 13% 14% 1% (1)% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $8.3 million mainly as a result of severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (refer to Note 15, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details), an increase in cost of support for sales evaluation of $6.5 million, an increase in certain expenses of $2.5 million as a result of our one-time leveraged recapitalization expense that was completed in the three months ended December 31, 2014, a payment related to a contractual settlement for $2.0 million, an increase due to the impairment charge recorded for certain long-lived assets of $1.7 million and an increase in legal fees of $1.6 million. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2013, SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by our receipt of $1.1 million in proceeds from a class action settlement, as well as our recovery of $1.1 million in receivables that had previously been classified as a bad debt expense during the three months ended December 31, 2013, both of which resulted in a decrease of our SG&A expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. The increases described above were partially offset by a decrease in travel related expenses of $4.3 million and a decrease in marketing-related expenses of $1.9 million. SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 were slightly lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, primarily due to lower levels of consulting expenses of $4.5 million and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $2.6 million as some intangible assets became fully amortized. This was partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $4.4 million as a result of hiring additional personnel.Restructuring ChargesIn April 2015, we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirement in our industry. The goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. We expect to recognize significant cost savings from a number of activities we have recently undertaken, including estimated annual cost savings of approximately $100 million of employee related costs as a result of our announced global employee workforce reduction. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a $31.6 million net restructuring charge, of which $8.0 million was recorded to costs of revenues, $11.1 million to engineering, research and development expense and $12.5 million to selling, general and administrative expense. A net restructuring charge amounting to $22.4 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, a substantial majority of which was related to our global workforce reduction plan. Refer to Note 15, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details.

The interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 remained relatively unchanged compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio. Since June 30, 2014, our investment balance for our marketable securities portfolio declined by $973 million as a result of our strategic decision to liquidate certain marketable securities in our investment portfolio to fund our working capital requirements. With this decision, our interest income earned from our investment portfolio is expected to decline and the realized gains as a result of liquidation of our investment portfolio are not expected to recur.The decrease in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 was primarily attributable to a net decline of $4.7 million in gains from the sale of equity investments in privately-held companies, a $1.1 million decrease in interest income from our investment portfolio as a result of our decision to liquidate certain marketable securities and a $1.1 million increase in net foreign currency losses resulting from the volatility of the foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which was partially offset by a decrease in an impairment charge of $1.0 million related to an equity investment in a privately-held company that was deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment and an increase of $0.9 million of realized gains from the investment portfolio liquidation.The increase in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 was primarily attributable to an increase of $3.7 million gain from the sale of an equity investment in a privately-held company, partially offset by an impairment charge of $1.4 million recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2013 related to an equity investment in a privately-held company that was deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment, and a decrease in interest income of $1.3 million driven by lower interest rates. Loss on extinguishment of debt and other, netFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, reflected a pre-tax net loss of $131.7 million associated with the redemption of our $750 million of 2018 Senior Notes during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net is the $1.2 million gain on the non-designated forward contract that was entered into by us in anticipation of the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes, which were redeemed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Refer to “Note 7, Debt” and “Note 16, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details. We had no loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. 47Table of ContentsProvision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2015 2014 2013Income before income taxes$434,131 $734,461 $690,621Provision for income taxes$67,973 $151,706 $147,472Effective tax rate15.7% 20.7% 21.4%The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates, tax credits, and other domestic incentives. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was 15.7% compared to 20.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. Tax expense as a percentage of income decreased primarily due to an increase in our research and development credits, an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction as a percentage of income, and a decrease in the percentage of income earned in the U.S. as a result of the loss on extinguishment of debt compared to income earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 was 20.7% compared to 21.4% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Tax expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in tax reserves and an increase in the percentage of our revenues that were earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates, partially offset by a decrease in our research and development credits and an increase in tax expense related to employee stock activity.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. We are under a United States federal income tax examination for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. 48Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2015 2014 2013Cash and cash equivalents$838,025 $630,861 $985,390Marketable securities1,549,086 2,521,776 1,933,491Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,387,111 $3,152,637 $2,918,881Percentage of total assets49% 57% 55% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2015 2014 2013Cash flows: Net cash provided by operating activities$605,906 $778,886 $913,188Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities918,221 (676,109) (241,447)Net cash used in financing activities(1,302,972) (458,887) (428,510)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(13,991) 1,581 (9,135)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$207,164 $(354,529) $234,096Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:As of June 30, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.39 billion, which is a decrease of $766 million from June 30, 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to payment of a special cash dividend of approximately $2.72 billion, payment of regular quarterly cash dividends of $324.8 million, payment for the redemption of our 2018 Senior Notes of $877.4 million, payment for stock repurchases of $602.9 million, payment of principal amount and prepayment of term loans and interest with respect to Senior Notes, term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility aggregating to $98.3 million, payment of interest up to the redemption date with respect to our 2018 Senior Notes of $32.8 million, partially offset by net proceeds of an aggregate of $3.22 billion from our issuance of Senior Notes, borrowings under our five-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans under our Credit Facility, and net proceeds from cash generated from operating activities. As of June 30, 2015, $1.47 billion of our $2.39 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to permanently reinvest $1.34 billion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued (but have not paid) U.S. taxes on the remaining cash of $136.3 million of the $1.47 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense.Cash Dividends and Special Cash Dividend:The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $324.8 million, $298.9 million and $265.9 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.45 to $0.50 per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2014. The amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights was $0.9 million as of June 30, 2015. We did not have accrued dividends payable in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested restricted stock units as described in Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans.” On July 14, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly cash dividend from $0.50 to $0.52 per share. Refer to Note 19, “Subsequent Events” for additional information regarding the quarterly cash dividend increase announced subsequent to June 30, 2015. 49Table of ContentsOn November 19, 2014, we declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock which was paid on December 9, 2014 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2014. Additionally, in connection with the special cash dividend, our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a proportionate and equitable adjustment to outstanding equity awards (restricted stock units and stock options) under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”), as required by the 2004 Plan, subject to the vesting requirements of the underlying awards. As the adjustment was required by the 2004 Plan, the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in any incremental compensation expense due to modification of such awards, under the authoritative guidance. The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 7, “Debt” that was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by the Company during the three months ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $2.76 billion, substantially all of which was paid out during the three months ended December 31, 2014. As of June 30, 2015, we have $41.1 million accrued dividends payable for the special cash dividend with respect to outstanding unvested restricted stock units, which will be paid when such underlying unvested restricted stock units vest as described in detail in Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans.” We did not declare any special cash dividend in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we historically have not declared any special cash dividends.Stock Repurchases:The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our ESPP program, the vesting of employee restricted stock units and the exercise of employee stock options.Fiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014Cash Flows from Operating Activities:We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, from $779 million to $606 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•A decrease of cash collections by approximately $270 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014,•An increase of debt-related interest payments of approximately $40 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014,•An increase in payments of approximately $15 million upon vesting of cash-based long-term incentive (""Cash LTI"") awards during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 under our Cash LTI employee compensation plan, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014,•An increase in payroll payments of approximately $15 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, partially offset by•A decrease in accounts payable payments of approximately $143 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, and•A decrease in income tax and other tax payments net of tax refunds of approximately $30 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.Cash Flows from Investing Activities:Net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 increased to $918 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 from net cash used in investing activities of $676 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the proceeds from sale of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $964 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, compared to the purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $593 million during fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. In addition, we acquired a privately-held company for a total purchase consideration of $18 million in cash during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. 50Table of ContentsCash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, from $459 million to $1.30 billion, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in dividend payments of $2.74 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, reflecting the payments for the special cash dividend during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and an increase in our quarterly dividend payout amount from $0.45 to $0.50 per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2014, •Payments for redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes and payments for the term loans, including prepayment for the principal amount for the term loans, aggregating to $916 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, whereas no such payments were made during the fiscal year ended June 20, 2014,•An increase in common stock repurchases of $362 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 and•A decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, partially offset by•Net proceeds of $3.22 billion from issuance of Senior Notes and the term loans during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.Fiscal Year 2014 Compared to Fiscal Year 2013Cash Flows from Operating Activities:Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, from $913 million to $779 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in payroll of approximately $44 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, •An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $39 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013,•An increase in income tax and other tax payments of approximately $19 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 and•Payments of approximately $15 million upon vesting of Cash LTI awards during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 under our Cash LTI employee compensation plan, whereas no such payments occurred during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013.Cash Flows from Investing Activities:Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from $241 million to $676 million, primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $424 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. In addition, we acquired a privately-held company for a total purchase consideration of $18 million in cash during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.Cash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 from $429 million to $459 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in dividend payments of $33 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount that we announced in July 2013, and•A decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $14 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, partially offset by•A decrease in common stock repurchases of $32 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. 51Table of ContentsDebt Issuance - Senior Notes:In November 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”). We issued the Senior Notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the Senior Notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans (described below) and cash on hand were used (x) to fund a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share, aggregating to approximately $2.76 billion, (y) to redeem $750 million of 2018 Senior Notes, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses and (z) for other general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares pursuant to our stock repurchase program. The interest rate specified for each series of the Senior Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of Senior Notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade. If the adjusted rating of any series of Senior Notes from Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) is decreased to Ba1, Ba2, Ba3 or B1 or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively (“bps” refers to Basis Points and 1% is equal to 100 bps). If the rating of any series of Senior Notes from S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to such series of Senior Notes is decreased to BB+, BB, BB- or B+ or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively. The interest rates on any series of Senior Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) if such series of Senior Notes becomes rated “Baa1” (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) and “BBB+” (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if rated by only one of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. In October 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the Senior Notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate. For additional details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”The original discount on the Senior Notes amounted to $4.0 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The debt indenture (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on its facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. As of June 30, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.Debt Issuance - Credit Facility (Term Loans and Unfunded Revolving Credit Facility):In November 2014, we entered into $750 million of five-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a $500 million unfunded revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Credit Facility”) under the Credit Agreement. The interest under the Credit Facility will be payable on the borrowed amounts at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which is currently 125 bps, and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades by Moody’s and S&P. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the then effective credit rating. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. Principal payments with respect to the term loans will be made on the last day of each calendar quarter and any unpaid principal balance of the term loans, including accrued interest, shall be payable on November 14, 2019 (the “Maturity Date”). We may prepay the term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the Company prepaid additional principal of $20.0 million in addition to the scheduled quarterly payments for the term loans.Future principal payments for the term loans (without giving effect for any prepayments made) as of June 30, 2015, are as follows:Fiscal Quarters Ending Quarterly Payment(in thousands)June 30, 2015 through December 31, 2016 $9,375March 31, 2017 through December 31, 2017 $14,063March 31, 2018 through September 30, 2019 $18,750December 31, 2019 $487,500 52Table of ContentsThe Credit Facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for the fiscal quarters as described below.Fiscal Quarters Ending Maximum Leverage RatioJune 30, 2015 4.25:1.00September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015 4.00:1.00March 31, 2016 through September 30, 2016 3.75:1.00December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 3.50:1.00Thereafter 3.00:1.00We were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2015 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 7.93 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 3.82 to 1.00) and had no outstanding borrowings under the unfunded revolving credit facility. Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the term loans, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our first quarter of fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.Debt Redemption: In December 2014, we redeemed the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Senior Notes. The redemption resulted in a pre-tax net loss on extinguishment of debt of $131.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014, which includes $1.2 million of gain upon the termination of the non-designated forward contract described below.In addition, in November 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate to be used for determining the redemption amount in connection with our redemption of the then outstanding 2018 Senior Notes that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The notional amount of the non-designated forward contract was $750 million. For additional details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” 53Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2015: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 and thereafter OthersDebt obligations(1)$3,211,250 $17,500 $46,875 $315,625 $75,000 $756,250 $2,000,000 $—Interest payment associated with alldebt obligations(2)1,060,852 119,117 118,606 114,796 110,711 100,310 497,312 —Purchase commitments(3)298,717 296,908 1,347 337 63 — 62 —Income taxespayable(4)76,939 — — — — — — 76,939Operating leases21,381 8,008 5,818 3,964 1,815 1,220 556 —Cash long-term incentive program (5)124,972 42,962 39,624 27,839 14,547 — — —Pension obligations21,546 3,034 1,348 1,570 1,559 1,413 12,622 —Executive DeferredSavings Plan(6)167,886 — — — — — — 167,886Other(7)42,002 22,173 9,599 6,985 3,245 — — —Total contractual cash obligations$5,025,545 $509,702 $223,217 $471,116 $206,940 $859,193 $2,510,552 $244,825__________________ (1)In November 2014, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of term loans due in fiscal year 2020 (outstanding balance of $711.3 million as of June 30, 2015) and $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2035.(2)The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes obligations included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable coupon rate for each series of Senior Notes. Our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above. The interest payments under the term loans are payable on the borrowed amounts at the LIBOR plus 125 bps. As of June 30, 2015, we utilized the existing interest rates to project our estimated term loans interest payments for the next five years. The interest payment under the revolving credit facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 15 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. Our future interest payments for the term loans and the revolving credit facility are subject to change due to future fluctuations in the LIBOR rates as well as any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating.(3)Represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with other goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.(4)Represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.(5)Represents the amount committed under our cash long-term incentive program. The expected payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately $101.8 million.(6)Represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant’s separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections. (7)Represents the amount committed for accrued dividends payable, substantially all of which are for the special cash dividend for the unvested restricted stock units as of the dividend record date as well as restricted stock units granted with dividend equivalent rights. For additional details, refer to Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans”. 54Table of ContentsStarting in fiscal year 2013 we adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. In order to receive payments under the Cash LTI Plan, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2015 2014 2013Receivables sold under factoring agreements$137,285 $116,292 $144,307Proceeds from sales of LCs$6,920 $8,323 $3,808 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $22.5 million, of which $19.0 million had been issued as of June 30, 2015, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. We maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $298.7 million as of June 30, 2015 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hours per week coverage for 12 months. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Working Capital:Working capital was $2.90 billion as of June 30, 2015, which was a decrease of $787.7 million compared to our working capital as of June 30, 2014. The decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to payment of a special cash dividend of approximately $2.72 billion, payment of regular quarterly cash dividends of $324.8 million, payment for the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes of $877.4 million, payment for stock repurchases of $602.9 million, payment of principal amount and prepayment of term loans and interest with respect to Senior Notes, term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility aggregating to $98.3 million, payment of interest up to the redemption date with respect to our 2018 Senior Notes of $32.8 million, partially offset by the aggregate of net proceeds of $3.22 billion from the issuance of Senior Notes and borrowings under our prepayable term loans. As of June 30, 2015, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.39 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $500 million unfunded revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. 55Table of ContentsOur credit ratings and outlooks as of June 30, 2015 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRating OutlookFitchBBB- StableMoody’sBaa2 StableStandard & Poor’sBBB StableFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 16 months, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2015 2014Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase$32,775 $6,066Sell$88,800 $33,999Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$64,012 $108,901Sell$123,091 $106,322In October 2014, in anticipation of the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into a series of forward contracts (“Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the Senior Notes. The objective of the Rate Lock Agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing, on the notional amount being hedged. The Rate Lock Agreements had a notional amount of $1 billion in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. We designated each of the Rate Lock Agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge, under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the close out of the Rate Lock Agreements was initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a reduction of total stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion, if any, was recognized in earnings immediately. The Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the $1.25 billion of 4.650% Senior Notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of a $7.5 million receivable as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2014. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we recognized $0.5 million for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which amount reduced the interest expense. We did not record any ineffectiveness for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The cash proceeds of $7.5 million from the settlement of the Rate Lock Agreements were included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 because the designated hedged item was classified as interest expense in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.In addition, in November 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 Senior Notes that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The objective of the forward contract was to hedge the risk associated with the variability of the redemption amount due to changes in interest rates through the redemption of the existing 2018 Senior Notes. The forward contract had a notional amount of $750 million. The forward contract was terminated in December 2014 and the resulting fair value of $1.2 million receivable was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net line in the consolidated statements of operations, partially offsetting the loss on redemption of the debt during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The cash proceeds from the forward contract were included in the cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, partially offsetting the cash outflows for the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes. 56Table of ContentsIndemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights used in our products and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us.In addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, service response time and other commitments. Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. To date, we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future.It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 57Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2015. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2015, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.65 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in fair value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2015, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $18.1 million.In November 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”) due in various fiscal years ranging from 2018 to 2035. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2015, the book value of our Senior Notes of $2.50 billion approximates the fair value. Additionally, the interest expense for the Senior Notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. Following a rating change below investment grade, the stated interest rate for each series of Senior Notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. Refer to Note 7, “Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7 for additional details. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. As of June 30, 2015, if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by Moody’s and S&P, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the Senior Notes, considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our Senior Notes, is estimated to be approximately $50.0 million.In November 2014, we entered into $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior, unsecured prepayable term loans due in 2019 and a $500 million unfunded revolving credit facility. The interest rates for the term loans are based on LIBOR plus a fixed spread and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. The fair value of the term loans is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with change in interest rates. As of June 30, 2015, the difference between book value and fair value of our term loans was immaterial. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the unfunded revolving credit facility which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. As of June 30, 2015, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 bps, the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately $6.3 million as it relates to our borrowings under the term loans. Additionally, as of June 30, 2015, if our credit rating was downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense for the term loans and the revolving credit facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $4.1 million. See Note 4, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2015.As of June 30, 2015, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $115.1 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2015, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $115.1 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $23.9 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows. 58Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:53.404121
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2016,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. In general, we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. When we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:•When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.•When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% of the payment is due based upon shipment.•When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.•When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.In circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.In many instances, products are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts. We have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. To determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy. For substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, we use vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third-party evidence (“TPE”) to allocate the selling price to each deliverable. We determine TPE based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis. When we are unable to establish relative selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (“ESP”) in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. ESP could potentially be used for new or customized products. We regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. In a multiple element revenue arrangement, we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer. To be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting, which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and (b) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. If the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer. 39Table of ContentsTrade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.We sell stand-alone software that is subject to software revenue recognition guidance. We periodically review selling prices to determine whether VSOE exists, and in situations where we are unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for 12 months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to such customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a regular basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 40Table of ContentsAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans. We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. We have elected not to include the indirect tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and therefore recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs.Accounting for Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation. Cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards issued to employees under our Cash LTI program vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. Compensation expense related to the Cash LTI awards is recognized over the vesting term, which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures.Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 13, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 5, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations. 41Table of ContentsIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently AdoptedIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standard update for the presentation of deferred income taxes. Under this new guidance, deferred tax assets and liabilities should be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. We early adopted this accounting standard update on a prospective basis at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended 2016. Upon adoption, approximately $218 million in net current deferred tax assets were reclassified to noncurrent. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted. 42Table of ContentsUpdates Not Yet EffectiveIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update regarding revenue from customer contracts to transfer goods and services or non-financial assets unless the contracts are covered by other standards (for example, insurance or lease contracts). Under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date of the update by one year, with early adoption on the original effective date permitted. With this amendment, the updates are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, with early adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. Subsequent to this amendment, the FASB has issued additional clarifying implementation guidance. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for customer’s cloud based fees. The guidance changes what a customer must consider in determining whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license. If the arrangement contains a software license, the customer would account for the fees related to the software license element in accordance with guidance related to internal use software; if the arrangement does not contain a software license, the customer would account for the arrangement as a service contract. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual period. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update for the subsequent measurement of inventory. The amended guidance requires entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The requirement would replace the current lower of cost or market evaluation and the accounting guidance is unchanged for inventory measured using last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) or the retail inventory method. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that changes the accounting for financial instruments primarily related to equity investments (other than those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee), financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. The accounting standard update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending 2019, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which amends the existing accounting standards for leases. Consistent with current guidance, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification. Under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2020 using a modified retrospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to simplify certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, an option to recognize gross stock-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as certain classifications in the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, with early adoption permitted and all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets. Under the update, credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses. The update also modifies the impairment models for available-for-sale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. The update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, with early adoption permitted starting in the first quarter of fiscal year ending 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements. 43Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including the LED and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and disk manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets - memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions, particularly in the foundry and logic markets, which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market. As we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. As our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. We are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. The semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation. The growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices in mobile consumer products has caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. On the other hand, higher design costs for the most advanced ICs could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment, although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ICs, reuse of installed products, and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes.The demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ICs that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices. The timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers’ requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules, and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we experienced strong demand for our products as we released a new generation of inspection products and our foundry customers increased their level of investments in our process control tools. Our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels, but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers’ technology roadmaps. We have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate. Over the past year, our customers have taken delivery of higher volumes of process control equipment than they did in the previous year. However, any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility, due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition due to expiration of credits or volume discounts, which, if not used by a stipulated time frame, will expire. 44Table of ContentsProposed Merger with Lam ResearchOn October 20, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with Lam Research Corporation (“Lam Research”), under which KLA-Tencor will ultimately become a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Lam Research. The Merger has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. The consummation of the Merger is conditioned on the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. On February 19, 2016, the Merger Agreement was approved by KLA-Tencor’s stockholders and Lam Research’s stockholders approved the issuance of Lam Research’s common stock in the Merger. Refer also to Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” For additional details on the transaction, refer to the copy of the Merger Agreement attached as an Exhibit to the Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on October 21, 2015.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2016 2015 2014Total revenues$2,984,493 $2,814,049 $2,929,408Costs of revenues$1,163,391 $1,215,229 $1,232,962Gross margin percentage61% 57% 58%Net income$704,422 $366,158 $582,755Diluted net income per share$4.49 $2.24 $3.47Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 increased by 6% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Our year over year revenue growth reflected increases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services. Increased revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were also driven by the introduction of our new generation of inspection products as well strong demand from our foundry customers and an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues.Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 decreased by 4% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. Revenue decreases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 reflected our customers’ decline in capital spending for process control equipment, due to shifts in the timing of the new technology ramps and capacity-related expansion plans.Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2016 2015 2014 FY16 vs. FY15 FY15 vs. FY14Revenues: Product$2,250,260 $2,125,396 $2,286,437 $124,864 6 % $(161,041) (7)%Service734,233 688,653 642,971 45,580 7 % 45,682 7 %Total revenues$2,984,493 $2,814,049 $2,929,408 $170,444 6 % $(115,359) (4)%Costs of revenues$1,163,391 $1,215,229 $1,232,962 $(51,838) (4)% $(17,733) (1)%Gross margin percentage61% 57% 58% 4% (1)% Product revenuesOur business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period. 45Table of ContentsProduct revenues increased by 6% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in China, Taiwan and Japan, partially offset by lower revenues from our customers in North America, Korea, Rest of Asia and Europe & Israel. The year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by strong demand for our inspection and metrology products, the introduction of our new generation of inspection products and the expansion of semiconductor investments in Asia, particularly in China and Taiwan from our foundry customers.Product revenues decreased by 7% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, primarily as a result of lower revenues from our customers in Taiwan, China and the rest of Asia, Europe and Israel, partially offset by higher revenues from our customers in North America, Korea and Japan. The decline in revenues was impacted by the timing of development and new technology ramps of our customers as well as the lower shipments of our products, particularly to our foundry customers in Taiwan, due to timing of capacity-related expansion plans.Service revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over that time period.Revenues - Top CustomersThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the indicated periods:Year ended June 30,2016 2015 2014Micron Technology, Inc.

The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageFiscal year ended June 30, 201457.9 %Revenue volume of products and services(1.1)%Mix of products and services sold0.3 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies(0.6)%Other service and manufacturing costs0.3 %Fiscal year ended June 30, 201556.8 %Revenue volume of products and services0.4 %Mix of products and services sold2.6 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies0.7 %Other service and manufacturing costs0.5 %Fiscal year ended June 30, 201661.0 %Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin increased to 61.0% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 from 56.8% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a favorable mix of products and services sold, an increase in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower warranty costs as well as a decrease in severance-related expenses, and higher revenue volume of products and service. Our gross margin decreased to 56.8% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 from 57.9% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to lower volume of products and services, as well as a reduction in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower manufacturing output and severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, refer to Note 14, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details. The above decreases were partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services sold and efficiencies derived from other service and manufacturing costs.Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2016 2015 2014 FY16 vs. FY15 FY15 vs. FY14R&D expenses$481,258 $530,616 $539,469 $(49,358) (9)% $(8,853) (2)%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues16% 19% 18% (3)% 1% R&D expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused R&D efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy. As technological innovation is essential to our success, we may incur significant costs associated with R&D projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses. 47Table of ContentsR&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in employee related expenses, including severance-related expenses of $33.9 million as a result of the reduced headcount from our global workforce reduction that we initiated during the three months ended June 30, 2015, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation of $10.6 million. Additionally, there was a decrease in engineering materials and supplies expenses of $21.0 million and an increase in the benefit to R&D expense from external funding of $5.4 million.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in engineering materials and consulting costs of $19.8 million associated with the completion of major platform developments, a decrease in depreciation expense of $2.1 million and a decrease in travel expenses of $1.2 million. This was partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $10.6 million mainly as a result of our severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, refer to Note 14, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details. In addition, the decrease was partially offset by a $6.3 million reduction in external funding used to offset the cost of R&D activities.Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2016 2015 2014 FY16 vs. FY15 FY15 vs. FY14SG&A expenses$379,399 $406,864 $384,907 $(27,465) (7)% $21,957 6%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues13% 14% 13% (1)% 1% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in employee-related expenses, including severance-related expenses, of $28.0 million as a result of the reduced headcount from our global workforce reduction that we initiated during the three months ended June 30, 2015 partially offset by an increase in variable compensation of $16.4 million, a decrease in cost of support for sales evaluation of $8.6 million, a decrease in contributions to support our corporate social responsibility program of $7.0 million and a decrease in travel-related expenses of $4.7 million. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase in our merger-related expenses of $15.6 million pertaining to the pending Merger with Lam Research, principally for financial advisory services including the fairness opinion fees, employee-related expenses and legal fees during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $8.3 million mainly as a result of severance-related expenses, a substantial amount of which is related to our global workforce reduction plan that we announced in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (refer to Note 14, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details), an increase in cost of support for sales evaluation of $6.5 million, an increase in certain expenses of $2.5 million as a result of our one-time leveraged recapitalization expense that was completed in the three months ended December 31, 2014, a payment related to a contractual settlement for $2.0 million, an increase due to the impairment charge recorded for certain long-lived assets of $1.7 million and an increase in legal fees of $1.6 million. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2013, SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by our receipt of $1.1 million in proceeds from a class action settlement, as well as our recovery of $1.1 million in receivables that had previously been classified as a bad debt expense during the three months ended December 31, 2013, both of which resulted in a decrease of our SG&A expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. The increases described above were partially offset by a decrease in travel related expenses of $4.3 million and a decrease in marketing-related expenses of $1.9 million. 48Table of ContentsRestructuring ChargesDuring the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended 2015, we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in its industry. The goals of this reduction were to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward its best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. We substantially completed our global workforce reduction during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and recorded an $8.9 million net restructuring charge, of which $3.6 million was recorded to costs of revenues, $1.6 million to research and development expense and $3.7 million to selling, general and administrative expense. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a $31.6 million net restructuring charge, of which $8.0 million was recorded to costs of revenues, $11.1 million to research and development expense and $12.5 million to selling, general and administrative expense. Refer to Note 14, “Restructuring Charges” for additional details.The following table shows the activity primarily related to accrual for severance and benefits for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2016 2015Beginning balance$24,887 $2,329Restructuring costs8,926 31,569Adjustments(142) 1,177Cash payments(33,084) (10,188)Ending balance$587 $24,887The remaining accrual for severance and benefits as of June 30, 2016 is expected to be paid out by the end of our quarter ending December 31, 2016.Interest Expense and Other Expense (Income), Net Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2016 2015 2014Interest expense$122,887 $106,009 $53,812Other expense (income), net$(20,634) $(10,469) $(16,203)Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues4% 4% 2%Other expense (income), net as a percentage of total revenues1% —% 1%The increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to the $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”), the $750.0 million unsecured prepayable term loans and the $500.0 million unfunded revolving credit facility which were executed during the three months ended December 31, 2014 and which were not outstanding for the entire fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. In addition, the $750.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes were redeemed during the three months ended December 31, 2014.The increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 was primarily attributable to the issuance of $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes and entry into the $750.0 million unsecured prepayable term loan facility during the three months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $750.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio. The increase in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to reduction of interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions of $5.5 million and an increase of $4.5 million for gain on the sale of equity investments in privately-held companies net of impairment charges. 49Table of ContentsThe decrease in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 was primarily attributable to a net decline of $4.7 million in gains from the sale of equity investments in privately-held companies, a $1.1 million decrease in interest income from our investment portfolio as a result of our decision to liquidate certain marketable securities and a $1.1 million increase in net foreign currency losses resulting from the volatility of the foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, which was partially offset by a decrease in an impairment charge of $1.0 million related to an equity investment in a privately-held company that was deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment and an increase of $0.9 million of realized gains from the investment portfolio liquidation.Loss on extinguishment of debt and other, netFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, reflected a pre-tax net loss of $131.7 million associated with the redemption of our $750.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net is the $1.2 million gain on the non-designated forward contract that was entered into by us in anticipation of the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes, which were redeemed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Refer to “Note 6, Debt” and “Note 15, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details. We had no loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2014.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2016 2015 2014Income before income taxes$858,192 $434,131 $734,461Provision for income taxes$153,770 $67,973 $151,706Effective tax rate17.9% 15.7% 20.7%The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates, tax credits, and other domestic incentives. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was 17.9% compared to 15.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Tax expense as a percentage of income increased primarily due to an increase in the percentage of income earned in the U.S. compared to income earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the loss on extinguishment of debt decreased income earned in the U.S.Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was 15.7% compared to 20.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. Tax expense as a percentage of income decreased primarily due to an increase in our research and development credits, an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction as a percentage of income, and a decrease in the percentage of income earned in the U.S. as a result of the loss on extinguishment of debt compared to income earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. 50Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2016 2015 2014Cash and cash equivalents$1,108,488 $838,025 $630,861Marketable securities1,382,806 1,549,086 2,521,776Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,491,294 $2,387,111 $3,152,637Percentage of total assets50% 49% 57% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2016 2015 2014Cash flows: Net cash provided by operating activities$759,696 $605,906 $778,886Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities144,687 918,221 (676,109)Net cash used in financing activities(636,702) (1,302,972) (458,887)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents2,782 (13,991) 1,581Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$270,463 $207,164 $(354,529)Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:As of June 30, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.49 billion, which is an increase of $104.2 million from June 30, 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to our cash generated from operations and our net proceeds from investing activities, partially offset by the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends and a special cash dividend with respect to fully vested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights aggregating to $346.3 million, payment for stock repurchases of $181.7 million and payment of term loans of $135.0 million. As of June 30, 2016, $1.73 billion of our $2.49 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $1.57 billion of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued (but have not paid) U.S. taxes on the remaining cash of $157.3 million of the $1.73 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense.Cash Dividends and Special Cash Dividend:The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $324.5 million, 324.8 million and $298.9 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.50 to $0.52 per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2015. The amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights was $2.7 million and $0.9 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not have accrued dividends payable as of June 30, 2014. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested restricted stock units as described in Note 7, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans.” 51Table of ContentsOn November 19, 2014, we declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock which was paid on December 9, 2014 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2014. Additionally, in connection with the special cash dividend, our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a proportionate and equitable adjustment to outstanding equity awards (restricted stock units and stock options) under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”), as required by the 2004 Plan, subject to the vesting requirements of the underlying awards. As the adjustment was required by the 2004 Plan, the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in any incremental compensation expense due to modification of such awards, under the authoritative guidance. The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 6, “Debt” that was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by the Company during the three months ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $2.76 billion, substantially all of which was paid out during the three months ended December 31, 2014, except for the aggregate special cash dividend of $43.0 million that was accrued for the unvested restricted stock units. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, we have $16.9 million and $41.1 million, respectively, of accrued dividends payable for the special cash dividend with respect to outstanding unvested restricted stock units, which will be paid when such underlying unvested restricted stock units vest as described in detail in Note 7, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans.” We paid a special cash dividend with respect to vested restricted stock units during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 of $21.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively. We did not declare any special cash dividend in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2014. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we historically have not declared any special cash dividends.Stock Repurchases:The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our ESPP program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units. In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement with Lam Research, we suspended further repurchases under our repurchase program effective October 21, 2015.Fiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015Cash Flows from Operating Activities:We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, from $605.9 million to $759.7 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in collections of approximately $294.0 million mostly due to higher shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015;•A decrease in payroll and employee-related payments of approximately $34.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015; partially offset by•An increase in vendor payments of approximately $65.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 mainly due to higher inventory purchases compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015;•A net increase of realized foreign exchange hedge losses of approximately $48.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, mainly due to the substantial foreign exchange fluctuations in Japanese Yen during these periods;•An increase in debt interest payments of approximately $27.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 due to higher average outstanding debt balances compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015; •An increase in income tax and other tax payments net of tax refunds of approximately $22.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015; and•An increase in cash LTI payments of approximately $13.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.Cash Flows from Investing Activities:Net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $144.7 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 from net cash provided in investing activities of $918.2 million, primarily as a result of our strategic decision to liquidate certain marketable securities in our investment portfolio to fund our working capital requirements during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, partially offset by approximately $14.0 million lower capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. 52Table of ContentsCash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, from $1.30 billion to $636.7 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•A decrease in payment of dividends to stockholders of $2.70 billion, primarily from the payment of special cash dividend during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015;•A decrease in repayment of debt of approximately $781.0 million mainly as a result of the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015;•A decrease in common stock repurchases of $421.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

In addition, we acquired a privately-held company for a total purchase consideration of $18.0 million in cash during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.Cash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, from $458.9 million to $1.30 billion, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in dividend payments of $2.74 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, reflecting the payments for the special cash dividend during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and an increase in our quarterly dividend payout amount from $0.45 to $0.50 per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2014, •Payments for redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes and payments for the term loans, including prepayment for the principal amount for the term loans, aggregating to $916.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, whereas no such payments were made during the fiscal year ended June 20, 2014,•An increase in common stock repurchases of $362.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 and 53Table of Contents•A decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $65.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, partially offset by•Net proceeds of $3.22 billion from issuance of Senior Notes and the term loans during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.Senior Notes:In November 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”). We issued the Senior Notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the Senior Notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans (described below) and cash on hand were used (x) to fund a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share, aggregating to approximately $2.76 billion, (y) to redeem $750.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses and (z) for other general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares pursuant to our stock repurchase program. The interest rate specified for each series of the Senior Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of Senior Notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade. If the adjusted rating of any series of Senior Notes from Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) is decreased to Ba1, Ba2, Ba3 or B1 or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively (“bps” refers to Basis Points and 1% is equal to 100 bps). If the rating of any series of Senior Notes from S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to such series of Senior Notes is decreased to BB+, BB, BB- or B+ or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively. The interest rates on any series of Senior Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) if such series of Senior Notes becomes rated “Baa1” (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) and “BBB+” (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if rated by only one of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. In October 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the Senior Notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate. For additional details, refer to Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”The original discount on the Senior Notes amounted to $4.0 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The debt indenture (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on its facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.Credit Facility (Term Loans and Unfunded Revolving Credit Facility):In November 2014, we entered into $750.0 million of five-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a $500.0 million unfunded revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Credit Facility”) under the Credit Agreement. The interest under the Credit Facility will be payable on the borrowed amounts at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which is currently 125 bps, and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades by Moody’s and S&P. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the Company’s then effective credit rating. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. Principal payments with respect to the term loans will be made on the last day of each calendar quarter and any unpaid principal balance of the term loans, including accrued interest, shall be payable on November 14, 2019 (the “Maturity Date”). We may prepay the term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we made term loan principal payments of $135.0 million. 54Table of ContentsFuture principal payments for the term loans (without giving effect to $117.5 million of principal prepayments made as of June 30, 2016 that shall be applied to the future scheduled quarterly payments) as of June 30, 2016, are as follows:Fiscal Quarters Ending Quarterly Payment(in thousands)September 30, 2016 through December 31, 2016 $9,375March 31, 2017 through December 31, 2017 $14,063March 31, 2018 through September 30, 2019 $18,750December 31, 2019 $487,500The Credit Facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for the fiscal quarters as described below.Fiscal Quarters Ending Maximum Leverage RatioJune 30, 2016 through September 30, 2016 3.75:1.00December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 3.50:1.00Thereafter 3.00:1.00We were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2016 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 9.12 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 2.75 to 1.00) and had no outstanding borrowings under the unfunded revolving credit facility. Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the term loans, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our first quarter of fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.Debt Redemption: In December 2014, we redeemed the $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Senior Notes. The redemption resulted in a pre-tax net loss on extinguishment of debt of $131.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014, after an offset of a $1.2 million of gain upon the termination of the non-designated forward contract described below.In addition, in November 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate to be used for determining the redemption amount as part of our plan to redeem the existing 2018 Senior Notes. The notional amount of the non-designated forward contract was $750.0 million. For additional details, refer to Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”Merger-related Commitment and Fees:We have an agreement with a financial advisor in relation to the pending Merger with Lam Research. We agreed to pay a fee of approximately $58.0 million, $0.1 million of which was paid upon the execution of the engagement letter and $5.0 million of which was paid upon delivery of the fairness opinion, and the remaining portion of which will be paid upon, and subject to, consummation of the Merger (provided that the final actual fee will be, in part, based on an average of the closing prices of Lam Research common stock over ten trading days approaching the closing of the Merger). During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, $5.1 million of the above fees were recorded in selling, general and administrative line of the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for us and further provides that we may be required to pay a termination fee of $290.0 million to Lam Research under certain circumstances. 55Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2016: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 and thereafter OthersDebt obligations(1)$3,076,250 $— $250,000 $70,000 $756,250 $— $2,000,000 $—Interest payment associated with alldebt obligations(2)946,076 119,053 116,084 112,650 100,976 92,875 404,438 —Purchase commitments(3)292,937 290,576 2,100 97 — 164 — —Income taxespayable(4)54,030 — — — — — — 54,030Operating leases17,058 8,026 5,006 2,363 1,613 25 25 —Cash long-term incentive program(5)121,447 47,942 37,085 24,908 11,512 — — —Pension obligations(6)22,086 1,301 1,487 1,536 1,452 1,664 14,646 —Executive DeferredSavings Plan(7)162,289 — — — — — — 162,289Other(8)43,406 8,917 30,520 3,576 393 — — —Total contractual cash obligations$4,735,579 $475,815 $442,282 $215,130 $872,196 $94,728 $2,419,109 $216,319__________________ (1)In November 2014, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans due in fiscal year 2020 (outstanding balance of $576.3 million as of June 30, 2016) and $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2035. During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we made term loan principal payments of $135.0 million.(2)The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes obligations included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable coupon rate for each series of Senior Notes. Our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above. The interest payments under the term loans are payable on the borrowed amounts at the LIBOR plus 125 bps. As of June 30, 2016, we utilized the existing interest rates to project our estimated term loans interest payments for the next five years. The interest payment under the revolving credit facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 15 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. Our future interest payments for the term loans and the revolving credit facility are subject to change due to future fluctuations in the LIBOR rates as well as any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating.(3)Represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with other goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.(4)Represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.(5)Represents the amount committed under our cash long-term incentive program. The expected payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately $97.9 million.(6)Represents an estimate of expected benefit payments up to fiscal year 2026 that was actuarially determined and excludes the minimum cash required to contribute to the plan. As of June 30, 2016, our defined pension plans do not have material required minimum cash contribution obligations. 56Table of Contents(7)Represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant’s separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections.(8)Includes $23.8 million of employee-related retention commitments which are estimated to be paid over the stipulated period in connection with the pending Merger with Lam Research as well as the amount committed for accrued dividends payable of $19.6 million, substantially all of which are for the special cash dividend for the unvested restricted stock units as of the dividend record date as well as restricted stock units granted with dividend equivalent rights. For additional details, refer to Note 7, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans”.Starting in fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, we adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in four equal installments, with 25% of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a four-year period. In order to receive payments under the Cash LTI Plan, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2016 2015 2014Receivables sold under factoring agreements$205,790 $137,285 $116,292Proceeds from sales of LCs$21,904 $6,920 $8,323 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $22.1 million, of which $18.7 million had been issued as of June 30, 2016, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia.We maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $292.9 million as of June 30, 2016 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hours per week coverage for 12 months. See Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 57Table of ContentsWorking Capital:Working capital was $2.87 billion as of June 30, 2016, which was a decrease of $37.2 million compared to our working capital as of June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.49 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $500 million unfunded revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. Our credit ratings and outlooks as of June 30, 2016 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRating OutlookFitchBBB- StableMoody’sBaa2 StableStandard & Poor’sBBB StableFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our earnings and cash flows from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum remaining maturities of approximately seven months and 16 months as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2016 2015Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase$7,591 $32,775Sell$91,793 $88,800Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$122,275 $64,012Sell$115,087 $123,091 58Table of ContentsIn October 2014, in anticipation of the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into a series of forward contracts (“Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the Senior Notes. The objective of the Rate Lock Agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing, on the notional amount being hedged. The Rate Lock Agreements had a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. We designated each of the Rate Lock Agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge, under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the close out of the Rate Lock Agreements was initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a reduction of total stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion, if any, was recognized in earnings immediately. The Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the $1.25 billion of 4.650% Senior Notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of $7.5 million as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2014. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which amount reduced the interest expense. As of June 30, 2016, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the forward contracts for the rate lock agreements was $6.3 million. The cash proceeds of $7.5 million from the settlement of the Rate Lock Agreements were included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 because the designated hedged item was classified as interest expense in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.In addition, in November 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 Senior Notes that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The objective of the forward contract was to hedge the risk associated with the variability of the redemption amount due to changes in interest rates through the redemption of the existing 2018 Senior Notes. The forward contract had a notional amount of $750.0 million. The forward contract was terminated in December 2014 and the resulting fair value of $1.2 million was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net line in the consolidated statements of operations, partially offsetting the loss on redemption of the debt during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The cash proceeds from the forward contract were included in the cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, partially offsetting the cash outflows for the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes.Indemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement of third-party intellectual property rights used in our products and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us. 59Table of ContentsIn addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, service response time and other commitments. Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. To date, we have made no accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future.It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 60Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2016. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2016, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.48 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2016, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $16.5 million.In November 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”) due in various fiscal years ranging from 2018 to 2035. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2016, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes were $2.68 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively. Additionally, the interest expense for the Senior Notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. Following a rating change below investment grade, the stated interest rate for each series of Senior Notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. Refer to Note 6, “Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7 for additional details. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. As of June 30, 2016, if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by Moody’s and S&P, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the Senior Notes, considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our Senior Notes, is estimated to be approximately $53.4 million.In November 2014, we entered into $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior, unsecured prepayable term loans due in 2019 and a $500 million unfunded revolving credit facility. The interest rates for the term loans are based on LIBOR plus a fixed spread and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. The fair value of the term loans is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with change in interest rates. As of June 30, 2016, the difference between book value and fair value of our term loans was immaterial. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the unfunded revolving credit facility which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. As of June 30, 2016, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 bps, the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately $5.2 million as it relates to our borrowings under the term loans. Additionally, as of June 30, 2016, if our credit rating was downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense for the term loans and the revolving credit facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $3.4 million. See Note 4, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2016.As of June 30, 2016, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $77.0 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 15, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2016, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $87.6 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $21.1 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows. 61Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:55.150932
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2017,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. In general, we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. When we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:•When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.•When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% of the payment is due based upon shipment.•When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.•When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.In circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.In many instances, products are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts. We have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. To determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy. For substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, we use vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third-party evidence (“TPE”) to allocate the selling price to each deliverable. We determine TPE based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis. When we are unable to establish relative selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (“ESP”) in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. ESP could potentially be used for new or customized products. We regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. In a multiple element revenue arrangement, we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer. To be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting, which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and (b) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. If the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer. 37Table of ContentsTrade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.We enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers. We accrue the estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives, and in situations when the credit levels vary depending upon sales volume, we update our accrual based on the amount that we estimate to be purchased pursuant to the volume purchase agreements. Accruals for customer credits are recorded as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue.Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.We sell stand-alone software that is subject to software revenue recognition guidance. We periodically review selling prices to determine whether VSOE exists, and in situations where we are unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for 12 months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.The deferred system profit balance equals the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to such customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair and maintain the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a regular basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 38Table of ContentsAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our accounts receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans. We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). Additionally, we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated amounts. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. Accounting for Cash-Based Long-Term Incentive Compensation. Cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards issued to employees under our Cash LTI program vest in three or four equal installments, with one-third or one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a three or four-year period. In order to receive payments under a Cash LTI award, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. Compensation expense related to the Cash LTI awards is recognized over the vesting term, which is adjusted for the impact of estimated forfeitures.Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 14, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived purchased intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit in our second quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations. 39Table of ContentsIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those recently adopted and the expected dates of adoption as well as estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements of those not yet adopted, see Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 40Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including advanced packaging, light emitting diode (“LED”), power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and disk manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand or expansion plans. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets - memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions, particularly in the foundry and logic markets, which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market. As we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. As our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. In the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, China is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. Government initiatives are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the US. China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector. We are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. The semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation. Currently, there are multiple drivers for growth in the industry with increased demand for chips providing computation power and connectivity for AI applications and support for mobile devices at the leading edge of foundry chip manufacturing. Qualification of early EUV lithography processes and equipment is driving growth at leading logic/foundry and DRAM manufacturers. Expansion of the IoT together with increasing acceptance of ADAS in anticipation of the introduction of autonomous cars have begun to accelerate legacy-node technology conversions and capacity expansions. Intertwined in these areas, spurred by data storage and connectivity needs, is the growth in demand for memory chips. On the other hand, higher design costs for the most advanced ICs could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment, although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ICs, reuse of installed products, and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes. 41Table of ContentsThe demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ICs that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices. The timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers’ requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules, and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand. Our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels, but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers’ technology roadmaps. We have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate. Over the past year, our customers have taken delivery of higher volumes of process control equipment than they did in the previous year. However, any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility, due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition.On October 20, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement” or “Merger”) with Lam Research Corporation (“Lam Research”) which was subject to regulatory approvals. On October 5, 2016, we mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement and no termination fees were payable by either party in connection with the termination.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands, except diluted net income per share)2017 2016 2015Total revenues$3,480,014 $2,984,493 $2,814,049Costs of revenues$1,287,547 $1,163,391 $1,215,229Gross margin percentage63% 61% 57%Net income$926,076 $704,422 $366,158Diluted net income per share$5.88 $4.49 $2.24Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 increased by 17% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Our year over year revenue growth reflected increases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services. Increased revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were also driven by strong demand from our foundry customers and an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues.Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 increased by 6% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Our year over year revenue growth reflected increases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services. Increased revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were also driven by the introduction of our new generation of inspection products as well strong demand from our foundry customers and an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues.Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2017 2016 2015 FY17 vs. FY16 FY16 vs. FY15Revenues: Product$2,703,934 $2,250,260 $2,125,396 $453,674 20% $124,864 6 %Service776,080 734,233 688,653 41,847 6% 45,580 7 %Total revenues$3,480,014 $2,984,493 $2,814,049 $495,521 17% $170,444 6 %Costs of revenues$1,287,547 $1,163,391 $1,215,229 $124,156 11% $(51,838) (4)%Gross margin percentage63% 61% 57% 2% 4% Product revenuesOur business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period. 42Table of ContentsProduct revenues increased by 20% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in Korea, Taiwan, and Europe & Israel. Our year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by strong demand for our inspection and metrology products, increased investments by our foundry customers to support their new device architectures and process technologies for capacity-related expansion, and sales of our next generation inspection products. Product revenues increased by 6% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in China, Taiwan and Japan, partially offset by lower revenues from our customers in North America, Korea, Rest of Asia and Europe & Israel. The year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by strong demand for our inspection and metrology products, the introduction of our new generation of inspection products and the expansion of semiconductor investments in Asia, particularly in China and Taiwan from our foundry customers.Service revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2016 and 2017, primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over that time period.Revenues - Top CustomersThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the indicated periods:Year ended June 30,2017 2016 2015Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageFiscal year ended June 30, 201556.8 %Revenue volume of products and services0.4 %Mix of products and services sold2.6 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies0.7 %Other service and manufacturing costs0.5 %Fiscal year ended June 30, 201661.0 %Revenue volume of products and services1.5 %Mix of products and services sold0.6 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies— %Other service and manufacturing costs(0.1)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 201763.0 %Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin increased to 63.0% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 from 61.0% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to a higher revenue volume of products and services and a favorable mix of products and services sold, partially offset by other service and manufacturing costs.Our gross margin increased to 61.0% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 from 56.8% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a favorable mix of products and services sold, an increase in manufacturing efficiencies driven by lower warranty costs as well as a decrease in severance-related expenses, and higher revenue volume of products and services.Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2017 2016 2015 FY17 vs. FY16 FY16 vs. FY15R&D expenses$526,870 $481,258 $530,616 $45,612 9% $(49,358) (9)%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues15% 16% 19% (1)% (3)% R&D expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused R&D efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy. As technological innovation is essential to our success, we may incur significant costs associated with R&D projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses. 44Table of ContentsR&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $25.4 million as a result of additional engineering headcount, higher variable compensation, and higher employee benefit costs, an increase in consulting expenses of $12.5 million, an increase in engineering materials and supplies expenses of $9.9 million, an increase in merger-related expenses of $2.3 million, a lower benefit from external funding of $1.9 million and higher travel-related costs of $1.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $7.3 million and lower severance-related charges of $1.5 million.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in employee-related expenses, including severance-related expenses of $33.9 million as a result of the reduced headcount from our global workforce reduction that we initiated during the three months ended June 30, 2015, partially offset by an increase in variable compensation of $10.6 million. Additionally, there was a decrease in engineering materials and supplies expenses of $21.0 million and an increase in the benefit to R&D expense from external funding of $5.4 million.Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2017 2016 2015 FY17 vs. FY16 FY16 vs. FY15SG&A expenses$389,336 $379,399 $406,864 $9,937 3% $(27,465) (7)%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues11% 13% 14% (2)% (1)% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in consulting expenses of $7.1 million; an increase in employee-related expenses of $6.7 million mainly as a result of higher variable compensation and employee benefit costs; an increase in travel costs of $2.3 million; an increase in cost of support for sales evaluations of $1.3 million and an increase in facilities-related expense of $1.1 million. The increases above were partially offset by a decrease in merger-related expenses of $6.6 million and a lower severance-related charges of $3.7 million.SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in employee-related expenses, including severance-related expenses, of $28.0 million as a result of the reduced headcount from our global workforce reduction that we initiated during the three months ended June 30, 2015 partially offset by an increase in variable compensation of $16.4 million, a decrease in cost of support for sales evaluation of $8.6 million, a decrease in contributions to support our corporate social responsibility program of $7.0 million and a decrease in travel-related expenses of $4.7 million. The decreases above were partially offset by an increase in our merger-related expenses of $15.6 million, principally for financial advisory services including the fairness opinion fees, employee-related expenses and legal fees during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.Restructuring ChargesDuring the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended 2015, we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in its industry. The goals of this reduction were to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward its best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. We substantially completed our global workforce reduction during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 45Table of ContentsThe following table shows the activity primarily related to accrual for severance and benefits for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2017 2016 2015Beginning balance$587 $24,887 $2,329Restructuring costs— 8,926 31,569Adjustments(147) (142) 1,177Cash payments(440) (33,084) (10,188)Ending balance$— $587 $24,887Interest Expense and Other Expense (Income), Net Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2017 2016 2015Interest expense$122,476 $122,887 $106,009Other expense (income), net$(19,461) $(20,634) $(10,469)Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues4% 4% 4%Other expense (income), net as a percentage of total revenues1% 1% —%During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 interest expense remained relatively unchanged compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.The increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was primarily attributable to the $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”), the $750.0 million unsecured prepayable term loans and the $500.0 million unfunded revolving credit facility which were executed during the three months ended December 31, 2014 and which were not outstanding for the entire fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. In addition, the $750.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes were redeemed during the three months ended December 31, 2014.Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio. The decrease in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in interest accruals related to uncertain tax positions of $6.4 million, a decrease in net gains from our investments in privately-held companies of $3.6 million, partially offset by an increase in interest income of $8.8 million.The increase in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 was primarily due to reduction of interest and penalty accruals related to uncertain tax positions of $5.5 million and an increase of $4.5 million for gain on the sale of equity investments in privately-held companies net of impairment charges.Loss on extinguishment of debt and other, netFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, reflected a pre-tax net loss of $131.7 million associated with the redemption of our $750.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net is the $1.2 million gain on the non-designated forward contract that was entered into by us in anticipation of the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes, which were redeemed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. Refer to “Note 7, Debt” and “Note 16, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the consolidated financial statements for further details. We had no loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net, in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. 46Table of ContentsProvision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2017 2016 2015Income before income taxes$1,173,246 $858,192 $434,131Provision for income taxes$247,170 $153,770 $67,973Effective tax rate21.1% 17.9% 15.7%The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates, tax credits, and other domestic incentives. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was 21.1% compared to 17.9% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Tax expense as a percentage of income increased primarily due to an increase in the percentage of income earned in the U.S. compared to income earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Tax expense as a percentage of income increased also because there was a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 due to settlements with taxing authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was 17.9% compared to 15.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Tax expense as a percentage of income increased primarily due to an increase in the percentage of income earned in the U.S. compared to income earned outside the U.S. in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the loss on extinguishment of debt decreased income earned in the U.S.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. We are under income tax examination in Israel for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013 through June 30, 2015. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2017 2016 2015Cash and cash equivalents$1,153,051 $1,108,488 $838,025Marketable securities1,863,689 1,382,806 1,549,086Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$3,016,740 $2,491,294 $2,387,111Percentage of total assets55% 50% 49% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2017 2016 2015Cash flows: Net cash provided by operating activities$1,079,665 $759,696 $605,906Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities(560,886) 144,687 918,221Net cash used in financing activities(472,805) (636,702) (1,302,972)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(1,411) 2,782 (13,991)Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$44,563 $270,463 $207,164 47Table of ContentsCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:As of June 30, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.02 billion, which is an increase of $525.4 million from June 30, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to our cash generated from operations, partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of $493.2 million, payment of dividends of $344.0 million, payment of term loans of $130.0 million, cash used for a business acquisition of $28.6 million and payment for stock repurchases of $25.0 million. As of June 30, 2017, $2.16 billion of our $3.02 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $2.00 billion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. Of the $2.16 billion, the remaining cash of $156.4 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries and branches for which earnings are not indefinitely reinvested. As we have accrued (but not paid) U.S. taxes on the earnings of these subsidiaries and branches, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense. Cash Dividends and Special Cash Dividend:The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $335.4 million, $324.5 million and $324.8 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.52 to $0.54 per share that was instituted during the three months ended December 31, 2016. The amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights was $4.8 million and $2.7 million as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested restricted stock units as described in Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans.”On June 1, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized an increase in the level of our quarterly cash dividend from $0.54 to $0.59 per share. Refer to Note 19, “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to June 30, 2017.On November 19, 2014, we declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock which was paid on December 9, 2014 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2014. Additionally, in connection with the special cash dividend, our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a proportionate and equitable adjustment to outstanding equity awards (restricted stock units and stock options) under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”), as required by the 2004 Plan, subject to the vesting requirements of the underlying awards. As the adjustment was required by the 2004 Plan, the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in any incremental compensation expense due to modification of such awards, under the authoritative guidance. The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 7, “Debt” that was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. As of the declaration date, the total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by us was approximately $2.76 billion, substantially all of which was paid out during the three months ended December 31, 2014, except for the aggregate special cash dividend of $43.0 million that was accrued for the unvested restricted stock units. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, we had $9.0 million and $16.9 million, respectively, of accrued dividends payable for the special cash dividend with respect to outstanding unvested restricted stock units, which will be paid when such underlying unvested restricted stock units vest. We paid a special cash dividend with respect to vested restricted stock units during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $8.6 million, $21.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we historically have not declared any special cash dividend.Stock Repurchases:The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our ESPP program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units. 48Table of ContentsFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016Cash Flows from Operating Activities:We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, from $759.7 million to $1.08 billion primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in collections of approximately $567.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year June 30, 2016, mainly driven by higher shipments;•The positive impact of our early adoption of the new accounting standard update for share-based payment awards to employees on a prospective basis during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which no longer requires the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation to be shown as a reduction within cash flows from operating activities of $11.9 million compared to the fiscal ended June 30, 2016;•An increase in interest income of approximately $9.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, as U.S. dollar interest rates increased; partially offset by◦An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $71.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016;◦An increase in income tax payments of $129.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, reflecting higher operating profits;◦An increase in payroll and employee expenses of approximately $85.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to a change in the timing of certain variable compensation payments; and◦Less unfavorable impacts from currency fluctuations of approximately $19.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.Cash Flows from Investing Activities:Net cash used by investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was $560.9 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $144.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The change primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable securities of $493.2 million and cash used for a business acquisition of $28.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.Cash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, from $636.7 million to $472.8 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in common stock repurchases of $156.7 million and the impact of our early adoption of the new accounting standard update for share-based payment awards to employees on a prospective basis during the year ended June 30, 2017. This new standard no longer requires the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation to be shown as a cash inflow from financing activities, resulting in a change of $11.9 million from the year ended June 30, 2016.Fiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015Cash Flows from Operating Activities:Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, from $605.9 million to $759.7 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in collections of approximately $294.0 million mostly due to higher shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015;•A decrease in payroll and employee-related payments of approximately $34.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015; partially offset by◦An increase in vendor payments of approximately $65.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 mainly due to higher inventory purchases compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015;◦A net increase of realized foreign exchange hedge losses of approximately $48.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, mainly due to the substantial foreign exchange fluctuations in Japanese Yen during these periods;◦An increase in debt interest payments of approximately $27.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 due to higher average outstanding debt balances compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015; 49Table of Contents◦An increase in income tax and other tax payments net of tax refunds of approximately $22.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015; and◦An increase in cash LTI payments of approximately $13.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.Cash Flows from Investing Activities:Net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $144.7 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 from net cash provided in investing activities of $918.2 million, primarily as a result of our strategic decision to liquidate certain marketable securities in our investment portfolio to fund our working capital requirements during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, partially offset by approximately $14.0 million lower capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.Cash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, from $1.30 billion to $636.7 million, primarily as a result of the following key factors:•A decrease in payment of dividends to stockholders of $2.70 billion, primarily from the payment of special cash dividend during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015;•A decrease in repayment of debt of approximately $781.0 million mainly as a result of the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015;•A decrease in common stock repurchases of $421.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, we suspended further repurchases under our repurchase program effective October 21, 2015; partially offset by◦Net proceeds of $3.22 billion from the issuance of Senior Notes and the term loans during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.Senior Notes:In November 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”). We issued the Senior Notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the Senior Notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans (described below) and cash on hand were used (x) to fund a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share, aggregating to approximately $2.76 billion, (y) to redeem $750.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses and (z) for other general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares pursuant to our stock repurchase program. The interest rate specified for each series of the Senior Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of Senior Notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade. If the adjusted rating of any series of Senior Notes from Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) is decreased to Ba1, Ba2, Ba3 or B1 or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively (“bps” refers to Basis Points and 1% is equal to 100 bps). If the rating of any series of Senior Notes from S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to such series of Senior Notes is decreased to BB+, BB, BB- or B+ or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively. The interest rates on any series of Senior Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) if such series of Senior Notes becomes rated “Baa1” (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) and “BBB+” (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if rated by only one of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. In October 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the Senior Notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate. For additional details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the consolidated financial statements.The original discount on the Senior Notes amounted to $4.0 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The debt indenture (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on its facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. As of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes. 50Table of ContentsCredit Facility (Term Loans and Unfunded Revolving Credit Facility):In November 2014, we entered into $750.0 million of five-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a $500.0 million unfunded revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Credit Facility”) under the Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The interest under the Credit Facility will be payable on the borrowed amounts at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which is currently 125 bps, and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the then effective credit rating. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades by Moody’s and S&P. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. Principal payments with respect to the term loans will be made on the last day of each calendar quarter and any unpaid principal balance of the term loans, including accrued interest, shall be payable on November 14, 2019 (the “Maturity Date”). We may prepay the term loans and unfunded revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we made term loan principal payments of $130.0 million. The remaining term loan balance of $446.3 million as of June 30, 2017 is due in the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2019.The Credit Facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement on a quarterly basis of 3.00 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter.We were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2017 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 11.58 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 2.08 to 1.00) and had no outstanding borrowings under the unfunded revolving credit facility. Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the term loans, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our first quarter of fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.Debt Redemption: In December 2014, we redeemed the $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Senior Notes. The redemption resulted in a pre-tax net loss on extinguishment of debt of $131.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014, after an offset of a $1.2 million of gain upon the termination of the non-designated forward contract described below.In addition, in November 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate to be used for determining the redemption amount as part of our plan to redeem the existing 2018 Senior Notes. The notional amount of the non-designated forward contract was $750.0 million. For additional details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the consolidated financial statements. 51Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2017: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 and thereafter OthersDebt obligations(1)$2,946,250 $250,000 $— $696,250 $— $500,000 $1,500,000 $—Interest payment associated with alldebt obligations(2)829,212 116,579 113,610 101,710 92,875 82,563 321,875 —Purchase commitments(3)432,752 428,903 3,586 142 121 — — —Income taxespayable(4)74,344 — — — — — — 74,344Operating leases25,515 9,073 5,768 4,341 2,486 1,358 2,489 —Cash long-term incentive program(5)163,141 58,088 46,809 34,534 23,710 — — —Pension obligations(6)23,938 1,551 1,586 1,534 1,705 2,574 14,988 —Executive DeferredSavings Plan(7)183,603 — — — — — — 183,603Other(8)34,600 28,640 4,822 1,044 94 — — —Total contractual cash obligations$4,713,355 $892,834 $176,181 $839,555 $120,991 $586,495 $1,839,352 $257,947__________________ (1)In November 2014, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of term loans due in fiscal year 2020 (outstanding balance of $446.3 million as of June 30, 2017) and $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2035. During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we made term loan principal payments of $130.0 million.(2)The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes obligations included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable coupon rate for each series of Senior Notes. Our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above. The interest payments under the term loans are payable on the borrowed amounts at the LIBOR plus 125 bps. As of June 30, 2017, we utilized the existing interest rates to project our estimated term loans interest payments for the next five years. The interest payment under the revolving credit facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 15 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. Our future interest payments for the term loans and the revolving credit facility are subject to change due to future fluctuations in the LIBOR rates as well as any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating.(3)Represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with other goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.(4)Represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.(5)Represents the amount committed under our cash long-term incentive program. The expected payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately $133.0 million.(6)Represents an estimate of expected benefit payments up to fiscal year 2027 that was actuarially determined and excludes the minimum cash required to contribute to the plan. As of June 30, 2017, our defined pension plans do not have material required minimum cash contribution obligations. 52Table of Contents(7)Represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant’s separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections.(8)Includes $20.8 million of employee-related retention commitments in connection with the retention program adopted at the time we entered into the Merger Agreement with Lam Research as well as the amount committed for accrued dividends payable of $13.8 million, substantially all of which are for the special cash dividend for the unvested restricted stock units as of the dividend record date as well as quarterly cash dividends from unvested restricted stock units granted with dividend equivalent rights. For additional details, refer to Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans.”We have adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in three or four equal installments, with one-third or one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a three or four-year period. In order to receive payments under the Cash LTI Plan, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods and services.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2017 2016 2015Receivables sold under factoring agreements$152,509 $205,790 $137,285Proceeds from sales of LCs$48,780 $21,904 $6,920 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $25.3 million, of which $22.1 million had been issued as of June 30, 2017, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia.We maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $432.8 million as of June 30, 2017 and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair and maintain the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hours per week coverage for 12 months. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. 53Table of ContentsWorking Capital:Working capital was $3.10 billion as of June 30, 2017, which was an increase of $233.3 million compared to our working capital as of June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2017, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $3.02 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global and regional economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $500.0 million unfunded revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2017 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRatingFitchBBB-Moody’sBaa2Standard & Poor’sBBBFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position and changes in our business strategy.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our earnings and cash flows from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum remaining maturities of approximately ten months and seven months as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2017 2016Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase$19,305 $7,591Sell$128,672 $91,793Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$165,563 $122,275Sell$118,504 $115,087 54Table of ContentsIn October 2014, in anticipation of the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into a series of forward contracts (“Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the Senior Notes. The objective of the Rate Lock Agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing, on the notional amount being hedged. The Rate Lock Agreements had a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. We designated each of the Rate Lock Agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge, under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the close out of the Rate Lock Agreements was initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a reduction of total stockholders’ equity and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion, if any, was recognized in earnings immediately. The Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the $1.25 billion of 4.650% Senior Notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of $7.5 million as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2014. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $0.8 million, $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which amount reduced the interest expense. As of June 30, 2017, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the forward contracts for the rate lock agreements was $5.5 million. The cash proceeds of $7.5 million from the settlement of the Rate Lock Agreements were included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 because the designated hedged item was classified as interest expense in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.In addition, in November 2014, we entered into a non-designated forward contract to lock the treasury rate used to determine the redemption amount of the 2018 Senior Notes that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The objective of the forward contract was to hedge the risk associated with the variability of the redemption amount due to changes in interest rates through the redemption of the existing 2018 Senior Notes. The forward contract had a notional amount of $750.0 million. The forward contract was terminated in December 2014 and the resulting fair value of $1.2 million was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt and other, net line in the consolidated statements of operations, partially offsetting the loss on redemption of the debt during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The cash proceeds from the forward contract were included in the cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, partially offsetting the cash outflows for the redemption of the 2018 Senior Notes.Indemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement by our products of third-party intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us. 55Table of ContentsIn addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, service response time and other commitments. Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. To date, we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future.It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 56Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2017. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2017, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $2.10 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2017, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $21.9 million.In November 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”) due in various fiscal years ranging from 2018 to 2035. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2017, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes were $2.67 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively. Additionally, the interest expense for the Senior Notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. Following a rating change below investment grade, the stated interest rate for each series of Senior Notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. Refer to Note 7, “Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7 for additional details. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. As of June 30, 2017, if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by Moody’s and S&P, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the Senior Notes, considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our Senior Notes, is estimated to be approximately $46.7 million.In November 2014, we entered into $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior, unsecured prepayable term loans due in 2019 and a $500.0 million unfunded revolving credit facility. The interest rates for the term loans are based on LIBOR plus a fixed spread and this spread is subject to adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. The fair value of the term loans is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with change in interest rates. As of June 30, 2017, the difference between book value and fair value of our term loans was immaterial. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the unfunded revolving credit facility which is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. As of June 30, 2017, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 bps, the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately $4.0 million as it relates to our borrowings under the term loans. Additionally, as of June 30, 2017, if our credit rating was downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense for the term loans and the revolving credit facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $2.7 million. See Note 4, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2017.As of June 30, 2017, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $62.3 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2017, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $57.7 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $29.6 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows. 57Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:51.705462
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2018,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. In general, we recognize revenue for systems when the system has been installed, is operating according to predetermined specifications and is accepted by the customer. When we have demonstrated a history of successful installation and acceptance, we recognize revenue upon delivery and customer acceptance. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:•When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria.•When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% of the payment is due based upon shipment.•When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory.•When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, in which case revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets predetermined specifications.In circumstances in which we recognize revenue prior to installation, the portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.In many instances, products are sold in stand-alone arrangements. Services are sold separately through renewals of annual maintenance contracts. We have multiple element revenue arrangements in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. To determine the relative fair value of each element in a revenue arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration based on the selling price hierarchy. For substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables pertaining to products and services, we use vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third-party evidence (“TPE”) to allocate the selling price to each deliverable. We determine TPE based on historical prices charged for products and services when sold on a stand-alone basis. When we are unable to establish relative selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use estimated selling price (“ESP”) in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. ESP could potentially be used for new or customized products. We regularly review relative selling prices and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates. In a multiple element revenue arrangement, we defer revenue recognition associated with the relative fair value of each undelivered element until that element is delivered to the customer. To be considered a separate element, the product or service in question must represent a separate unit of accounting, which means that such product or service must fulfill the following criteria: (a) the delivered item(s) has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis; and (b) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. If the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria, the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until all elements are accepted by the customer. 39Table of ContentsTrade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue recognized on the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.We enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers. We accrue the estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives, and in situations when the credit levels vary depending upon sales volume, we update our accrual based on the amount that we estimate will be purchased pursuant to the volume purchase agreements. Accruals for customer credits are recorded as an offset to revenue or deferred revenue.Spare parts revenue is recognized when the parts have been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including consulting and training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.We sell stand-alone software that is subject to software revenue recognition guidance. We periodically review selling prices to determine whether VSOE exists, and in situations where we are unable to establish VSOE for undelivered elements such as post-contract service, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for 12 months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.The deferred system profit balance equals the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which have not met our revenue recognition criteria, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to certain customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to such customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our accounts receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. 40Table of ContentsAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans. We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). Additionally, we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated amounts. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 14, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived purchased intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment or prior to that, if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which the law is enacted.Transition tax liability is recognized in the period when the change in the U.S. tax law was enacted and the income tax effects are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. The calculation of the transition tax liability includes assumptions and reasonable estimates of the income tax effects and are based on provisional tax amounts. Several inputs were considered in the calculation, such as the calculation of the post-1986 foreign earnings and profit (“E&P”), income tax pools for all foreign subsidiaries, and the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. We applied the current interpretations from the U.S. federal and state governments and regulatory organization in our calculation of the transition tax liability and our reasonable estimate of the transition tax liability could change if further interpretations are provided for in the future. We expect to fully complete our provisional transition tax liability calculation within the reasonable measurement period allowed by the authoritative guidance. 41Table of ContentsDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those recently adopted and the expected dates of adoption as well as estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements of those not yet adopted, see Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including advanced packaging, light emitting diode (“LED”), power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and hard disk drive manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand or expansion plans. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets - memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions, particularly in the foundry and logic markets, which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market. As we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. As our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. In the global semiconductor related industries, China is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. Government initiatives are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the US. China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor capital equipment sector. We are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. The semiconductor industry has also been characterized by constant technological innovation. Currently, there are multiple drivers for growth in the industry with increased demand for chips providing computation power and connectivity for Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) applications and support for mobile devices at the leading edge of foundry and logic chip manufacturing. Qualification of early extreme ultraviolet (“EUV”) lithography processes and equipment is driving growth at leading logic/foundry and dynamic random-access memory (“DRAM”) manufacturers. Expansion of the Internet of Things (“IoT”) together with increasing acceptance of advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”) in anticipation of the introduction of autonomous cars have begun to accelerate legacy-node technology conversions and capacity expansions. Intertwined in these areas, spurred by data storage and connectivity needs, is the growth in demand for memory chips. On the other hand, higher design costs for the most advanced ICs could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment, although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ICs, reuse of installed products, and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes. 43Table of ContentsThe demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ICs that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices. The timing for our customers in ordering and taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment is also determined by our customers’ requirements to meet the next generation production ramp schedules, and the timing for capacity expansion to meet end customer demand. Our earnings will depend not only on our revenue levels, but also on the amount of research and development spending required to meet our customers’ technology roadmaps. We have maintained production volumes and capacity to meet anticipated customer requirements and remain at risk of incurring significant inventory-related and other restructuring charges if business conditions deteriorate. Over the past year, our customers have taken delivery of higher volumes of process control equipment than they did in the previous year. However, any delay or push out by our customers in taking delivery of process control and yield management equipment may cause earnings volatility, due to increases in the risk of inventory related charges as well as timing of revenue recognition.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands, except diluted net income per share)2018 2017 2016Total revenues$4,036,701 $3,480,014 $2,984,493Costs of revenues$1,447,369 $1,287,547 $1,163,391Gross margin percentage64% 63% 61%Net income$802,265 $926,076 $704,422Diluted net income per share$5.10 $5.88 $4.49Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 increased by 16% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Our year over year revenue growth was primarily due to increases from sales of both our wafer inspection and patterning products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services, and an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues.Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 increased by 17% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Our year over year revenue growth reflected increases from sales of both our inspection and metrology products as our customers continue to invest in process control and services. Increased revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were also driven by strong demand from our foundry customers and an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period for our service revenues.Proposed Merger with Orbotech, Ltd.On March 18, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Orbotech, Ltd. (“Orbotech”) pursuant to which we would acquire Orbotech for $38.86 in cash and 0.25 of a share of our common stock in exchange for each ordinary share of Orbotech, which at the time of announcement valued Orbotech at $3.2 billion in enterprise value. The merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Orbotech Merger”) is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of the other customary closing conditions. We intend to fund the cash portion of the purchase price with cash from the combined company's balance sheet. In addition, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase authorization. The share repurchase program is targeted to be completed within 12 to 18 months following the close of this transaction. We intend to raise approximately $1 billion in new long-term debt financing to complete the share repurchaseFor additional details, refer to Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements, and Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. 44Table of ContentsRevenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2018 2017 2016 FY18 vs. FY17 FY17 vs. FY16Revenues: Product$3,160,671 $2,703,934 $2,250,260 $456,737 17% $453,674 20%Service876,030 776,080 734,233 99,950 13% 41,847 6%Total revenues$4,036,701 $3,480,014 $2,984,493 $556,687 16% $495,521 17%Costs of revenues$1,447,369 $1,287,547 $1,163,391 $159,822 12% $124,156 11%Gross margin percentage64% 63% 61% 1% 2% Product revenuesOur business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period.Product revenues increased by 17% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in Korea, China, and Japan. Our year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by increased investments from our memory and wafer customers for next generation technology as well as capacity-related investments. Product revenues increased by 20% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to growth in revenues from our customers in Korea, Taiwan, and Europe & Israel. Our year over year increase in our product revenues were primarily driven by strong demand for our inspection and metrology products, increased investments by our foundry customers to support their new device architectures and, and sales of our next generation inspection products. Service revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Service revenues increased sequentially over the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018, primarily as a result of an increase over time in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over that time period.Revenues - Top CustomersThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the indicated periods:Year ended June 30,2018 2017 2016Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.

The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageFiscal year ended June 30, 201661.0 %Revenue volume of products and services1.5 %Mix of products and services sold0.6 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies— %Other service and manufacturing costs(0.1)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 201763.0 %Revenue volume of products and services0.8 %Mix of products and services sold0.9 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies(0.4)%Other service and manufacturing costs(0.2)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 201864.1 %Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume of products and services reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin increased to 64.1% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 from 63.0% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to a favorable mix of products and services sold, a higher revenue volume of products and services, and lower customer support costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing and service costs to support increased volume of product shipments. 46Table of ContentsOur gross margin increased to 63.0% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 from 61.0% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to a higher revenue volume of products and services and a favorable mix of products and services sold, partially offset by other service and manufacturing costs.Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2018 2017 2016 FY18 vs. FY17 FY17 vs. FY16R&D expenses$608,712 $526,870 $481,258 $81,842 16% $45,612 9%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues15% 15% 16% —% (1)% R&D expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our focused R&D efforts that are aligned with our overall business strategy. As technological innovation is essential to our success, we may incur significant costs associated with R&D projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses. 47Table of ContentsR&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $39.0 million as a result of additional engineering headcount, higher variable compensation, and higher employee benefit costs and an increase in engineering materials and supplies expenses of $32.7 million. R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $25.4 million as a result of additional engineering headcount, higher variable compensation, and higher employee benefit costs, an increase in consulting expenses of $12.5 million, and an increase in engineering materials and supplies expenses of $9.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $7.3 million.Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2018 2017 2016 FY18 vs. FY17 FY17 vs. FY16SG&A expenses$443,426 $389,336 $379,399 $54,090 14% $9,937 3%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues11% 11% 13% —% (2)% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $36.5 million mainly as a result of additional headcount, higher variable compensation and employee benefit costs, an increase in Orbotech merger-related expense of $10.6 million, an increase in facilities-related expense of $4.8 million, and an increase in travel-related costs of $4.6 million, partially offset by $9.3 million of lower Lam Research Corporation merger-related expenses.SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in consulting expenses of $7.1 million, an increase in employee-related expenses of $6.7 million mainly as a result of higher variable compensation and employee benefit costs, partially offset by a decrease in merger-related expenses of $6.6 million.Restructuring ChargesDuring the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended 2015, we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in its industry. The goals of this reduction were to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward its best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. We completed our global workforce reduction during the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Restructuring charges for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was immaterial. Restructuring charges for the year ended June 30, 2016 were $8.9 million, of which $3.6 million were related to cost of revenues, $1.6 million to research and development expense and $3.7 million to selling, general and administrative expense lines of the consolidated statements of operations.Interest Expense and Other Expense (Income), Net Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2018 2017 2016Interest expense$114,376 $122,476 $122,887Other expense (income), net$(33,113) $(19,461) $(20,634)Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues3% 4% 4%Other expense (income), net as a percentage of total revenues1% 1% 1%The decrease in interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, was primarily due to a $250.0 million repayment of the Senior Notes at maturity and prepayment of term loans. 48Table of ContentsDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 interest expense remained relatively unchanged compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies, interest related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio. The increase in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $13.9 million and a decrease in accruals related to uncertain tax positions of $2.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in net gains from our investments in privately-held companies of $1.6 million.The decrease in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in interest accruals related to uncertain tax positions of $6.4 million, a decrease in net gains from our investments in privately-held companies of $3.6 million, partially offset by an increase in interest income of $8.8 million.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2018 2017 2016Income before income taxes$1,455,931 $1,173,246 $858,192Provision for income taxes$653,666 $247,170 $153,770Effective tax rate44.9% 21.1% 17.9%Our effective tax rate during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. Income tax effects resulting from changes in tax laws are accounted for by us in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that these tax effects be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted and the effects are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. We have not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act. As a result, we made an additional provision for income tax during the three months ended June 30, 2018 relating to the enactment of the Act.This Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system which reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% as of January 1, 2018; shifts to a modified territorial tax regime which requires companies to pay a transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred; and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. The decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% results in a blended statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The new taxes for certain foreign-sourced earnings under the Act are effective for the Company after the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Tax expense was higher as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 primarily due to the impact of the following items:•Tax expense increased by $339.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 relating to a transition tax on the Company’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (“E&P”) which, prior to the enactment of the Act, was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes;•Tax expense increased by $102.1 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 relating to the re-measurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the Act’s new corporate tax rate of 21.0%; partially offset by•Tax expense decreased by $50.9 million relating to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 28.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 49Table of ContentsAs of June 30, 2018, we had not yet completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act. Our provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 is based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects on its transition tax and existing deferred tax balances. For the amounts which we were able to reasonably estimate, we recognized a provisional tax amount of $441.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The provisional tax amount is included as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. The components of the provisional tax amounts are as follows:•We recorded a provisional tax amount of $339.6 million for the transition tax liability. We will elect to remit the U.S. transition tax liability in installments over an eight-year period. We have not yet completed the calculation of the total post-1986 foreign E&P and the income tax pools for all foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P previously deferred from U.S. federal and state governments and regulatory organizations may change the provisional tax liability or the accounting treatment of the provisional tax liability. •We recorded a provisional tax amount of $102.1 million to re-measure certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the Act. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining the estimate of the expected reversal of our deferred tax balances. This can potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts.The Act also includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. This income will effectively be taxed at a 10.5% tax rate in general. As a result, our deferred tax assets and liabilities are being evaluated if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of GILTI provisions that are effective for us after the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, or should the tax on GILTI provisions be recognized in the period the Act was signed into law. Because of the complexity of the new provisions, we are continuing to evaluate on how the provisions will be accounted for under the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles wherein companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election of either (i) account for GILTI as a component of tax expense in the period in which we are subject to the rules (the “period cost method”), or (ii) account for GILTI in our measurement of deferred taxes (the “deferred method”). Currently, we have not elected a method and will only do so after our completion of the analysis of the GILTI provisions and our election method will depend, in part, on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future U.S. inclusions in our taxable income related to GILTI and, if so, the impact that is expected.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world. We are under United States federal income tax examination for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. 50Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2018 2017 2016Cash and cash equivalents$1,404,382 $1,153,051 $1,108,488Marketable securities1,475,936 1,863,689 1,382,806Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,880,318 $3,016,740 $2,491,294Percentage of total assets51% 55% 50% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2018 2017 2016Cash flows: Net cash provided by operating activities$1,229,120 $1,079,665 $759,696Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities291,618 (560,886) 144,687Net cash used in financing activities(1,270,103) (472,805) (636,702)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents696 (1,411) 2,782Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$251,331 $44,563 $270,463Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:As of June 30, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.88 billion, which is a decrease of $136.4 million from June 30, 2017. The decrease is mainly due to the payment of $946.3 million for Senior Notes, term loans, and the borrowed amount under the Revolving Credit Facility, payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of $402.1 million, and stock repurchases of $203.2 million, partially offset by our cash generated from operations, proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility, net of issuance costs, of $248.7 million, and net proceeds from marketable securities of $375.4 million. As of June 30, 2018, $1.93 billion of our $2.88 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We have accrued U.S. federal taxes under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and can repatriate these funds without incurring any additional U.S. federal tax other than if the U.S. dollar value of the funds increase. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $1.71 billion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 1%-22% of the funds repatriated, in addition to the transition tax liability already computed on such balances. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of $219.3 million of the$1.93 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense.Cash Dividends and Special Cash Dividend:The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $395.6 million, $335.4 million and $324.5 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.54 to $0.59 per share, and from $0.59 to $0.75 per share that were instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2017, and June 30, 2018, respectively. The amount of accrued dividends payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights was $6.7 million and $4.8 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested restricted stock units as described in Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans.”On August 2, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share. Refer to Note 19, “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to June 30, 2018.On November 19, 2014, we declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock which was paid on December 9, 2014 to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2014. Additionally, in connection with the special cash dividend, our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a proportionate and equitable adjustment to outstanding equity awards (restricted stock units and stock options) under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”), as required by the 2004 Plan, subject to the vesting requirements of the underlying awards. As the adjustment was required by the 2004 Plan, the adjustment to the outstanding awards did not result in 51Table of Contentsany incremental compensation expense due to modification of such awards, under the authoritative guidance. The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 7, “Debt” that was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. As of the declaration date, the total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by us was approximately $2.76 billion, substantially all of which was paid out during the three months ended December 31, 2014, except for the aggregate special cash dividend of $43.0 million that was accrued for the unvested restricted stock units. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, we had $2.8 million and $9.0 million, respectively, of accrued dividends payable for the special cash dividend with respect to outstanding unvested restricted stock units, which will be paid when such underlying unvested restricted stock units vest. We paid a special cash dividend with respect to vested restricted stock units during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $6.4 million, $8.6 million and $21.8 million, respectively. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we historically have not declared any special cash dividend.Stock Repurchases:The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our ESPP program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units. Fiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017Cash Flows from Operating Activities:We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 increased by $149.5 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, from $1.08 billion to $1.23 billion primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in collections of approximately $533.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year June 30, 2017, mainly driven by higher shipments;•An increase in interest income of approximately $14.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, as U.S. dollar interest rates increased; partially offset by◦An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $316.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017;◦An increase in income tax payments of $19.1 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017; and◦An increase in payroll and employee expenses of approximately $57.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.Cash Flows from Investing Activities:Net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $291.6 million compared to net cash used by investing activities of $560.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. The change primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable securities of $492.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to net liquidation of marketable securities of $375.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Cash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, from $472.8 million to $1.27 billion. Net cash used in financing activities were mainly impacted by:•An increase in the repayment of debt of $816.3 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017;•An increase in common stock repurchases of $178.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017•An increase in dividend and dividend equivalent payments of $58.1 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, due to an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.54 to $0.75 per share instituted during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, partially offset by◦An increase in proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility, net of issuance costs of $248.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. 52Table of ContentsFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016Cash Flows from Operating Activities:Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, from $759.7 million to $1.08 billion primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in collections of approximately $567.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year June 30, 2016, mainly driven by higher shipments;•The positive impact of our early adoption of the new accounting standard update for share-based payment awards to employees on a prospective basis during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which no longer requires the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation to be shown as a reduction within cash flows from operating activities of $11.9 million compared to the fiscal ended June 30, 2016;•An increase in interest income of approximately $9.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, as U.S. dollar interest rates increased; partially offset by◦An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $71.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016;◦An increase in income tax payments of $129.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, reflecting higher operating profits;◦An increase in payroll and employee expenses of approximately $85.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to a change in the timing of certain variable compensation payments; and◦Less unfavorable impacts from currency fluctuations of approximately $19.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.Cash Flows from Investing Activities:Net cash used by investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was $560.9 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $144.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The change primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable securities of $493.2 million and cash used for a business acquisition of $28.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.Cash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, from $636.7 million to $472.8 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in common stock repurchases of $156.7 million and the impact of our early adoption of the new accounting standard update for share-based payment awards to employees on a prospective basis during the year ended June 30, 2017. This new standard no longer requires the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation to be shown as a cash inflow from financing activities, resulting in a change of $11.9 million from the year ended June 30, 2016.Senior Notes:In November 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”). We issued the Senior Notes as part of the leveraged recapitalization plan under which the proceeds from the Senior Notes in conjunction with the proceeds from the term loans (described below) and cash on hand were used (x) to fund a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share, aggregating to approximately $2.76 billion, (y) to redeem $750.0 million of 2018 Senior Notes, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses and (z) for other general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares pursuant to our stock repurchase program. The interest rate specified for each series of the Senior Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of Senior Notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade. If the adjusted rating of any series of Senior Notes from Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) is decreased to Ba1, Ba2, Ba3 or B1 or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively (“bps” refers to Basis Points and 1% is equal to 100 bps). If the rating of any series of Senior Notes from S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) with respect to such series of Senior Notes is decreased to BB+, BB, BB- or B+ or below, the stated interest rate on such series of Senior Notes as noted above will increase by 25 bps, 50 bps, 75 bps or 100 bps, respectively. The interest rates on any series of Senior Notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by any of Moody’s, 53Table of ContentsS&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) if such series of Senior Notes becomes rated “Baa1” (or its equivalent) or higher by Moody’s (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency) and “BBB+” (or its equivalent) or higher by S&P (or, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency), or one of those ratings if rated by only one of Moody’s, S&P and, if applicable, any Substitute Rating Agency, in each case with a stable or positive outlook. In October 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the Senior Notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate. For additional details, refer to Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the consolidated financial statements.The original discount on the Senior Notes amounted to $4.0 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The debt indenture (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on its facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. As of June 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.Credit Facility (Term Loans and Unfunded Revolving Credit Facility) and Revolving Credit Facility:In November 2014, we entered into $750.0 million of five-year senior unsecured prepayable term loans and a $500.0 million unfunded revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Credit Facility”). In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) providing for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Facility. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. We made borrowings of $250.0 million from the Revolving Credit Facility on the closing date, which were paid in full during the second half of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility until its maturity on November 30, 2022 (the “Maturity Date”), at which time such Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans under such facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid. We may prepay the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at either: (i) the Alternative Base Rate (“ABR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 0 bps to 75 bps, or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps. The spreads under ABR and LIBOR are subject to adjustment in conjunction with credit rating downgrades or upgrades. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps, subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating. As of June 30, 2018, we elected to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility.The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis of 3.00 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions.We were in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2018 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 14.93 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 1.32 to 1.00). Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. 54Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2018: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 and thereafter OthersDebt obligations(1)$2,250,000 $— $250,000 $— $500,000 $— $1,500,000 $—Interest payment associated with alldebt obligations(2)700,573 102,453 98,238 94,016 83,703 72,538 249,625 —Purchase commitments(3)530,783 525,729 4,509 490 55 — — —Income taxespayable(4)63,931 — — — — — — 63,931Operating leases26,361 8,410 6,417 4,489 2,448 1,837 2,760 —Cash long-term incentive program(5)162,907 60,790 49,085 38,899 14,133 — — —Pension obligations(6)26,205 1,484 1,668 1,481 2,194 1,945 17,433 —Executive DeferredSavings Plan(7)199,505 — — — — — — 199,505Transition tax payable(8)347,548 29,169 27,685 27,685 27,685 27,685 207,639 —Other(9)9,571 6,467 2,167 659 278 — — —Total contractual cash obligations$4,317,384 $734,502 $439,769 $167,719 $630,496 $104,005 $1,977,457 $263,436__________________ (1)Represents $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2035.(2)The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes obligations included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable coupon rate for each series of Senior Notes. Our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above. The interest payment under the Revolving Credit Facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 15 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. Our future interest payments for the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to change due to any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating.(3)Represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with other goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.(4)Represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.(5)Represents the amount committed under our cash long-term incentive program.

As of June 30, 2018, our defined benefit pension plans do not have material required minimum cash contribution obligations.(7)Represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant’s separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections. 55Table of Contents(8)Represents our reasonable estimate of a provisional tax amount for the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs-Act into law on December 22, 2017.(9)Represents amounts committed for accrued dividends payable, substantially all of which are for the special cash dividend for the unvested restricted stock units as of the dividend record date as well as quarterly cash dividends for unvested restricted stock units granted with dividend equivalent rights. For additional details, refer to Note 8, “Equity and Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We have adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in three or four equal installments, with one-third or one-fourth of the aggregate amount of the Cash LTI award vesting on each yearly anniversary of the grant date over a three or four-year period. In order to receive payments under the Cash LTI Plan, participants must remain employed by us as of the applicable award vesting date. We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods and services.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2018 2017 2016Receivables sold under factoring agreements$217,462 $152,509 $205,790Proceeds from sales of LCs$5,511 $48,780 $21,904 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $22.4 million, of which $15.6 million had been issued as of June 30, 2018, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia.We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for 12 months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; our warranty charge estimates for more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hours per week coverage for 12 months. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.Working Capital:Working capital was $3.33 billion as of June 30, 2018, which is an increase of $232.0 million compared to our working capital as of June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.88 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions including the pending acquisition of Orbotech, and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $750.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. 56Table of ContentsOur credit ratings as of June 30, 2018 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRatingFitchBBB+Moody’sBaa2Standard & Poor’sBBBFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, business acquisitions, our financial position and changes in our business strategy.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our earnings and cash flows from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). Our outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts, with maximum remaining maturities of approximately ten months as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2018 2017Cash flow hedge contracts- foreign currency Purchase$8,116 $19,305Sell$115,032 $128,672Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$130,442 $165,563Sell$154,442 $118,504In October 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts (“Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark rate on a portion of the Senior Notes. The Rate Lock Agreements had a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate which matured in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of pricing of the $1.25 billion of 4.650% Senior Notes due in 2024 and we recorded the fair value of $7.5 million as a gain within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2014.We recognized $0.8 million for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, for the amortization of the gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which amount reduced the interest expense. As of June 30, 2018, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the forward contracts for the rate lock agreements was $4.8 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, we entered into a series of forward contracts (the “2018 Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark interest rate prior to expected debt issuances. The objective of the 2018 Rate Lock Agreements was to hedge the risk associated with the variability in interest rates due to the changes in the benchmark rate leading up to the closing of the intended financing, on the notional amount being hedged. The 2018 Rate Lock Agreement had a notional amount of $500.0 million in aggregate with contract maturity dates in the first half of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. Each forward contract will be closed on the earlier of the completion date of pricing of the portion of the intended debt being hedged or the expiration date. We designated each of the 2018 Rate Lock Agreements as a qualifying hedging instrument to be accounted for as a cash flow hedge, under which the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), and subsequently amortized into earnings as a component of interest expenses over the term of the underlying debt. The ineffective portion, if any, will be recognized in earnings immediately. The fair market value of the 2018 Rate Lock Agreements outstanding as of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $4.9 million. 57Table of ContentsIndemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. For example, we have paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification obligations generally described in this paragraph is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement by our products of third-party intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to matters such as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us.In addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, service response time and other commitments. Furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. If a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. To date, we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. While we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future.It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 58Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2018. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2018, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.50 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2018, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $13.6 million.In November 2014, we issued $2.50 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior, unsecured long-term notes (collectively referred to as “Senior Notes”). The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2018, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes were $2.33 billion and $2.25 billion, respectively, due in various fiscal years ranging from 2020 to 2035. Additionally, the interest expense for the Senior Notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. Following a rating change below investment grade, the stated interest rate for each series of Senior Notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. Refer to Note 7, “Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7 for additional details. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. As of June 30, 2018, if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by Moody’s and S&P, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the Senior Notes, considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our Senior Notes, is estimated to be approximately $45.0 million.In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. We made borrowings of $250.0 million from the Revolving Credit Facility on the closing date, which were paid in full during the second half of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. As of June 30, 2018, we do not have any outstanding floating rate debts that are subject to an increase in interest rates. We are obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 15 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility which is subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. As of June 30, 2018, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $1.0 million. See Note 4, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2018.As of June 30, 2018, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $130.9 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2018, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $1.4 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $30.2 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows.As of June 30, 2018, we had forward contracts to sell $500.0 million in treasury securities in order to hedge certain interest rate exposures (see Note 14, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements for additional details). A 10% adverse move in interest rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $24.1 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our interest rate exposure, changes in most relevant interest rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows. 59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:52.402128
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2019,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”). Pursuant to the FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, discussions related to the changes in results of operations from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2017 have been omitted. Such omitted discussion can be found under Item 7 of our annual Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, filed with the SEC.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYWe are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including advanced packaging, light emitting diode (“LED”), power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and hard disk drive manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand or expansion plans. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets - memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions, particularly in the foundry and logic markets, which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market. Through the acquisition of Orbotech, Ltd. (“Orbotech”), we have expanded our reach in the electronics value chain to include technologically advanced, yield-enhancing and process-enabling solutions to address various manufacturing stages of Printed Circuit Boards (“PCB”), Flat Panel Displays (“FPD”), Specialty Semiconductor Devices (“SD”) and other electronic components. The products include Automated Optical Inspection (“AOI”), Automated Optical Shaping (“AOS”), Direct Imaging (“DI”), additive printing, laser drilling, laser plotters, Computer aided manufacturing (“CAM”) and engineering solutions for PCB and additional adjacent electronics component manufacturing, as well as AOI, test, repair and process monitoring systems for FPD manufacturing and vacuum process tools for etch, Physical Vapor Deposition (“PVD”), Molecular Vapor Deposition (“MVD”) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (“CVD”) solutions for SD manufacturing.In our newly acquired Orbotech business, consumer end markets have been experiencing a fundamental shift in technology complexity, driven primarily by the proliferation of high-end mobile devices and automotive devices, as well as by the demand for large area FPDs such as large-size LCD televisions and OLED displays. The shift towards 5G connectivity and the fast-paced growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”) services is expected to continue to further accelerate this shift as more devices become connected and dependent upon other electronic devices. 41Table of ContentsAs a supplier to the global semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronics industries, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. As our customer base becomes increasingly more concentrated, large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more volatility for revenues and earnings. In the global semiconductor and electronics related industries, China is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. Additionally, a significant portion of global FPD and PCB manufacturing has migrated to China. Government initiatives are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the US. China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector. We are also subject to the cyclical capital spending that has historically characterized the semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronics industries. The timing, length, intensity and volatility of the capacity-oriented capital spending cycles of our customers are unpredictable. The semiconductor and electronics industries have also been characterized by constant technological innovation. Currently, there are multiple drivers for growth in the industry with increased demand for chips providing computation power and connectivity for Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) applications and support for mobile devices at the leading edge of foundry and logic chip manufacturing. Qualification of early extreme ultraviolet (“EUV”) lithography processes and equipment is driving growth at leading logic/foundry and dynamic random-access memory (“DRAM”) manufacturers. Expansion of IoT together with increasing acceptance of advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”) in anticipation of the introduction of autonomous cars have begun to accelerate legacy-node technology conversions and capacity expansions. Intertwined in these areas, spurred by data storage and connectivity needs, is the growth in demand for memory chips. On the other hand, higher design costs for the most advanced ICs could economically constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers to focus their resources on only the large technologically advanced products and applications. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment, although the growth for such equipment may be adversely impacted by higher design costs for advanced ICs, reuse of installed products, and delays in production ramps by our customers in response to higher costs and technical challenges at more advanced technology nodes.Additionally, current trends in smart mobile devices, 5G connectivity, automotive electronics, smart vehicles, flexible displays, AR/VR and wearable devices, high-performance computing, large size televisions and the IoT are expected to drive the need for production, inspection, test and repair solutions that are able to address the cutting-edge technology embedded in these types of electronic products.The demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ICs that are incorporated into sophisticated mobile devices. Our customers continuously seek to increase yields and enhance the efficiency of their manufacturing processes, including by improving their manufacturing, inspection, testing and repair capabilities.Subsequent to the Orbotech Acquisition, we changed our organizational structure resulting in four reportable segments: Semiconductor Process Control, Specialty Semiconductor Process, PCB, Display and Component Inspection, and Other. Prior period results have been recast to conform to the current presentation.Our view of the current wafer fab equipment demand climate is aligned with consensus industry analyst expectations for the calendar year 2019, which reflects a decline in capital equipment spending by memory customers. In contrast to the memory business, capital equipment spending by foundry and logic customers at the leading edge has begun to ramp up, and the momentum is expected to continue in calendar year 2019. We have already seen our mix of business begin to shift toward increased purchases by logic and foundry customers as a percentage of total sales, and we expect spending from these customers to continue to remain strong. Because of a more diversified semiconductor device-end demand, and disciplined capacity planning by wafer fab equipment customers, we believe the long-term growth dynamics for the industry remain strong. While manufacturers of PCBs, FPDs, SDs and other electronic components create different products for diverse end-markets, they share similar production challenges in an increasingly competitive environment. 42Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years(1): Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands, except diluted net income per share)2019 2018 2017Total revenues$4,568,904 $4,036,701 $3,480,014Costs of revenues$1,869,377 $1,446,041 $1,286,215Gross margin percentage59% 64% 63%Net income attributable to KLA(2)$1,175,617 $802,265 $926,076Diluted net income per share attributable to KLA$7.49 $5.10 $5.88__________________ (1)On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective transition approach. Results for reporting periods beginning after June 30, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the previous revenue guidance in ASC 605.(2)Our net income attributable to KLA decreased to $802.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, primarily as a result of the income tax effects from the enacted tax reform legislation through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.Total revenues during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 increased by 13% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Our year over year revenue growth reflected strong demand in the semiconductor process control market, growth in service revenues, and additional revenues from the Orbotech business which was acquired in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.Acquisition of Orbotech, Ltd. On February 20, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Orbotech for total purchase consideration of approximately $3.26 billion. Orbotech’s core business enables electronic device manufacturers to inspect, test and measure printed circuit boards and flat panel displays to verify their quality; pattern electronic circuitry on substrate and perform three-dimensional shaping of metalized circuits on multiple surfaces; and utilize advanced vacuum deposition and etching process in semiconductor device and semiconductor manufacturing and to perform laser drilling of electronic substrates. For additional details on the financial statement impacts of the Orbotech acquisition, refer to Note 6 “Business Combinations” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase of up to $2.00 billion of our common stock, reflecting an increase from $1.00 billion upon the close of the Orbotech Acquisition. We raised approximately $1.20 billion in new long-term debt financing to partially refinance our existing debt, to repurchase shares and for general corporate purposes. For additional details, refer to Note 8, “Debt”, and Note 10, “Stock Repurchase Program” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition. We primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries, maintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services and the sale of spare parts. Our solutions provide a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products, which are accompanied by a flexible portfolio of services to enable our customers to maintain the performance and productivity of the solutions purchased. The acquisition of Orbotech enabled us to broaden our portfolio to include the yield enhancement and production solutions used by manufacturers of printed circuit boards, flat panel displays, advanced packaging, micro-electro-mechanical systems and other electronic components. 43Table of ContentsOur solutions are generally not sold with a right of return, nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers.We account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectibility of consideration is probable.Our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes. The revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer.Our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. A product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.The transaction consideration, including any sales incentives, is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”) for each distinct product or service. Management considers a variety of factors to determine the SSP, such as, historical standalone sales of products and services, discounting strategies and other observable data.From time to time, our contracts are modified to account for additional, or to change existing, performance obligations. Our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively.Product RevenueWe recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. We use judgment to evaluate whether the control has transferred by considering several indicators, including:•whether we have a present right to payment;•the customer has legal title;•the customer has physical possession;•the customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership; and•the customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the customer has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory).Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer. In circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance, the portion of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install product is deferred and recognized upon acceptance.We enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers. We adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives. These credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreed-upon incentive rate. The estimate is updated at each reporting period.We offer perpetual and term licenses for defects and data analysis software. The primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software, while the functionality and the features of the software are the same. With the acquisition of Orbotech we offer computer-aided manufacturing and engineering software solutions for the printed circuit boards production. Software is generally bundled with post-contract customer support (“PCS”), which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. Revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time, when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from PCS is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. 44Table of ContentsServices and Spare Parts RevenueThe majority of product sales include a standard 6 to 12-month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers. The customers may also purchase extended warranty for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale. We have concluded that the standard 12-month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations. The estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us.Additionally, we offer product maintenance and support services, which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale. Revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed. We also sell spare parts, revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer.Installation services include connecting and validating configuration of the product. In addition, several testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to customer specifications. Revenues from product installation are deferred and recognized at a point in time, once installation is complete.Significant JudgmentsOur contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation. Determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements. We typically estimate the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a standalone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we use information such as the size of the customer, geographic region, as well as customization of the products in determining the SSP. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors, including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. While changes in the allocation of SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations.Although the products are generally not sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement. These credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available.As outlined above, we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and considers the several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer. Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer.Contract Assets/LiabilitiesThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment. Contract assets primarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time. Contract assets are transferred to receivable when rights to payment become unconditional.A contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance. The contract liabilities represent (1) deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which the control has not been transferred to the customers, and (2) deferred service revenue, which is recorded when we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services, and maintenance and other service contracts. 45Table of ContentsContract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon the adoption of ASC 606, deferred costs of revenue are included in other current assets while under the legacy guidance deferred costs of revenue was included in deferred system profit.Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, including assumptions associated with the technology migration curve, estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets, and discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.The fair value of IPR&D is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the IPR&D assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of IPR&D is recorded to research and development expenses. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. 46Table of ContentsAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans. We account for stock-based awards granted to employees for services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value for restricted stock units granted without “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, adjusted to exclude the present value of dividends which are not accrued on the restricted stock units. The fair value for restricted stock units granted with “dividend equivalent” rights is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The award holder is not entitled to receive payments under dividend equivalent rights unless the associated restricted stock unit award vests (i.e., the award holder is entitled to receive credits, payable in cash or shares of our common stock, equal to the cash dividends that would have been received on the shares of our common stock underlying the restricted stock units had the shares been issued and outstanding on the dividend record date, but such dividend equivalents are only paid subject to the recipient satisfying the vesting requirements of the underlying award). Compensation expense for restricted stock units with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, or when a grant contains a market condition, the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation incorporates estimates of the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date fair value of each award. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated amounts. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based historical implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 15, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived purchased intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 7, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We performed our annual qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and concluded that there was no impairment. In addition, as a result of the Orbotech Acquisition, we updated our organizational structure and performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill for our reporting units, which were impacted by the organizational change, and concluded that there were no impairment indicators affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to our annual impairment test. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.If we were to encounter challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, we may be required to perform quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. In addition, if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment or prior to that, if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would occur or, if it does, whether such charge would be material to our results of operations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which the law is enacted.Transition tax liability is recognized in the period when the change in the U.S. tax law was enacted and the income tax effects are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. Several inputs were considered in the calculation, such as the calculation of the post-1986 foreign earnings and profit (“E&P”), income tax pools for all foreign subsidiaries, and the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. We applied the current interpretations from the U.S. federal and state governments and regulatory organization in its calculation of the transition tax liability. 47Table of ContentsDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.We record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for U.S. operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings.Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. This income will effectively be taxed at a 10.5% tax rate in general. As a result, our deferred tax assets and liabilities were being evaluated to determine if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of GILTI provisions that are effective for us after the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, or should the tax on GILTI provisions be recognized as period costs in each year incurred. We elected to account for GILTI as a component of current period tax expense starting from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those recently adopted and the expected dates of adoption as well as estimated effects, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements of those not yet adopted, see Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 48Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenues and Gross Margin On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective transition approach. Results for reporting periods beginning after June 30, 2018 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts are presented under legacy guidance.

Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period.The increase in product revenues by 7% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to product revenue from our newly acquired Orbotech business, increased investments from our foundry and wafer customers, and a favorable impact from the adoption of ASC 606 due to our earlier timing of transfer of control, partially offset by a lower products shipments to customers in the memory business.Service revenuesService revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The increase in service revenues by 34% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to service revenues from our newly acquired Orbotech business, the impact of adoption of ASC 606 whereby revenue from the standard warranty represents a separate performance obligation and included in our services revenue, and an increase in the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites.Revenues by segment(1) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2019 2018 2017 FY19 vs. FY18 FY18 vs. FY17Revenues: Semiconductor Process Control$4,080,822 $3,944,015 $3,408,876 $136,807 3% $535,139 16%Specialty Semiconductor Process151,164 — — 151,164 (3) — (3) PCB, Display and Component Inspection(2)332,810 92,516 71,557 240,294 (3) 20,959 (3) Other4,676 — — 4,676 (3) — (3) Total revenues$4,569,472 $4,036,531 $3,480,433 $532,941 (3) $556,098 (3) __________(1)Segment revenues exclude corporate allocation and the effects of foreign exchange rates.

(3)No meaningful comparative information exists for the prior periods. 49Table of ContentsFiscal Year 2019 compared with Fiscal Year 2018Revenue from our Semiconductor Process Control segment increased by 3% primarily due to a strong demand from our customers in the patterning business, and growth in service revenues. The increase in revenues from Specialty Semiconductor Process, PCB, Display and Component Inspection and Other segments primarily relates to the Orbotech business which was acquired in February of 2019.Fiscal Year 2018 compared with Fiscal Year 2017Revenue from our Semiconductor Process Control segment increased by 16%, primarily due to increases from sales of both our wafer inspection and patterning products as our customers continue to invest in the process control and services, and an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites over this time period.

It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, average customer pricing and customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements. Changes in gross margin percentage from the mix of products and services sold, reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings, and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments from business combinations. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements, and amortization of intangible assets. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.The decrease in our gross margin to 59.1% from 64.1% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Orbotech, which historically had lower product gross margins, an increase in service and manufacturing costs, and a lower revenue volume of products and services. These trends were partially offset by a favorable mix of products and services sold.Segment gross margin(1) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2019 2018 2017 FY19 vs. FY18 FY18 vs. FY17Segment gross margin: Semiconductor Process Control$2,590,434 $2,554,223 $2,160,747 $36,211 1% $393,476 18%Specialty Semiconductor Process78,800 — — 78,800 (3) — (3) PCB, Display and Component Inspection(2)155,765 38,428 30,914 117,337 (3) 7,514 (3) Other1,102 — — 1,102 (3) — (3) $2,826,101 $2,592,651 $2,191,661 $233,450 (3) $400,990 (3) _________________ (1)Segment gross margin is calculated as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues and excludes corporate allocation and the effects of foreign exchange rates, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments, and acquisition related costs.

As technological innovation is essential to our success, we may incur significant costs associated with R&D projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $36.2 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and higher employee benefit costs, an increase in depreciation expense of $5.1 million, and $55.7 million of expenses from the Orbotech business.Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2019 2018 2017 FY19 vs. FY18 FY18 vs. FY17SG&A expenses$599,124 $442,304 $388,211 $156,820 35% $54,093 14%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues13% 11% 11% 2% —% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $11.1 million as a result of additional headcount, and higher employee benefit costs, an increase in acquisition-related expenses of $22.0 million, $10.9 million of stock-based compensation expense acceleration for certain equity awards for Orbotech employees and $91.8 million of expenses from the Orbotech business, including $30.2 million of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets. 52Table of ContentsInterest Expense and Other Expense (Income), Net Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2019 2018 2017Interest expense$124,604 $114,376 $122,476Other expense (income), net$(31,462) $(30,482) $(16,822)Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues3% 3% 4%Other expense (income), net as a percentage of total revenues1% 1% —%The increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, was primarily due to interest on the $1.20 billion Senior Notes issued in March 2019.Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, and interest-related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our invested cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $3.7 million, partially offset by an increase in accruals related to uncertain tax positions of $2.6 million.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2019 2018 2017Income before income taxes$1,296,231 $1,455,931 $1,173,246Provision for income taxes$121,214 $653,666 $247,170Effective tax rate9.4% 44.9% 21.1%Our effective tax rate during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. Income tax effects resulting from changes in tax laws are accounted for by us in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that these tax effects be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted and the effects are recorded as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. We have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act. As a result, we recorded a tax benefit of $19.3 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 relating to the transition tax liability provided by the Act.Tax expense was lower as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 primarily due to the impact of the following items:•Tax expense decreased by $49.9 million relating to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 28.1% to 21% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% as of January 1, 2018. The decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% results in a blended statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018;•Tax expense decreased by $320.2 million relating to the one -time transition tax recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 on our total post-1986 earnings and profits (“E&P”) of which, prior to the enactment of the Act, was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes; and•Tax expense decreased by $102.1 million relating to the one-time re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 based on the Act’s new corporate tax rate of 21.0%.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. 53Table of ContentsIn the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world. We are subject to federal income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and are under U.S. federal income tax examination for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We are subject to state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. We are also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore and Israel, for all years beginning from the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. We are under audit in Germany related to Orbotech for the years ended December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.In May 2017, Orbotech received an assessment from the ITA with respect to its fiscal years 2012 through 2014 (the “Assessment”, and the “Audit Period”, respectively), for an aggregate amount of tax against us, after offsetting all NOLs for tax purposes available through the end of 2014, of approximately NIS 218 million (approximately $61.0 million as of June 30, 2019), which amount includes related interest and linkage differentials to the Israeli consumer price index (as of date of the Assessment). We believe our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of the Assessment.On August 31, 2018, Orbotech filed an objection in respect of the tax assessment (the “Objection”). Orbotech is now in the process of the second stage, in which the claims raised by it in the Objection are examined by different personnel at the Israel Tax Authority (“ITA”). In addition, the ITA can examine additional items and may assess additional amounts in the second stage. The second stage must be completed within one year of when the Objection was filed.Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2019 2018 2017Cash and cash equivalents$1,015,994 $1,404,382 $1,153,051Marketable securities723,391 1,475,936 1,863,689Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$1,739,385 $2,880,318 $3,016,740Percentage of total assets19% 51% 54% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2019 2018 2017Cash flows: Net cash provided by operating activities$1,152,632 $1,229,120 $1,079,665Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities(1,180,982) 291,618 (560,886)Net cash used in financing activities(360,005) (1,270,103) (472,805)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(33) 696 (1,411)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents$(388,388) $251,331 $44,563Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:As of June 30, 2019, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.74 billion, which represents a decrease of $1.14 billion from June 30, 2018. The decrease is mainly due to $1.82 billion paid to fund Orbotech and other business acquisitions, payment of dividends and dividend equivalents of $472.3 million, and stock repurchases of $1.10 billion, partially offset by the net proceeds from our 2019 Senior Notes of $1.18 billion, our cash generated from operations of $1.15 billion and net proceeds of $764.2 million from marketable securities transactions. As of June 30, 2019, $669.3 million of our $1.74 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $379.1 million of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 1%-22% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of $290.2 million of the $669.3 million held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense. 54Table of ContentsCash Dividends and Special Cash Dividend:The total amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $469.4 million, $395.6 million and $335.4 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.59 to $0.75 per share that were instituted during the three months ended June 30, 2018. The amount of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with dividend equivalent rights was $7.3 million and $6.7 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested RSUs as described in Note 9, “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 1, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share. Refer to Note 19, “Subsequent Events” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to June 30, 2019.On November 19, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 8, “Debt” that was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by us at the declaration date was substantially paid out during the three months ended December 31, 2014, except for the aggregate special cash dividend of $43.0 million that was accrued for the unvested RSUs and to be paid when such underlying unvested RSUs vest. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, all of the special cash dividends accrued with respect to outstanding RSUs were vested and paid in full. We paid a special cash dividend with respect to vested restricted stock units during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 of $2.9 million, $6.4 million and $8.6 million, respectively. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we historically have not declared any special cash dividend. For details of the special cash dividend, refer to Note 9 “Equity, Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements Stock Repurchases:The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units. Fiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018Cash Flows from Operating Activities:We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 decreased by $76.5 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, from $1.23 billion to $1.15 billion primarily as a result of the following factors:•An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $58.0 million;•An increase in payments for employee-related expenses of approximately $51.0 million;•An increase in payments for merger and acquisition related expenses, net of cash outflow mostly related to the Orbotech acquisition of approximately $51.0 million; These trends were partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments of $72.7 million, and an increase in collections of approximately $10.0 million.Cash Flows from Investing Activities:Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was $1.18 billion compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $291.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. This increase was mainly due to $1.82 billion paid to fund Orbotech and other acquisitions, an increase in capital expenditures of $63.6 million, partially offset by higher net sales and maturities of marketable securities of $388.8 million. 55Table of ContentsCash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, from $1.27 billion to $360.0 million. This change was mainly impacted by net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes in March 2019 of $1.18 billion, partially offset by an increase in common stock repurchases of $892.0 million and an increase in dividend and dividend equivalent payments of $70.2 million due to an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.59 to $0.75 per share.Senior Notes:In March 2019 and November 2014, we issued $1.20 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively (each a “2019 Senior Notes”, a “2014 Senior Notes”, and collectively the “Senior Notes”), aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes. The interest rate specified for each series of the 2014 Senior Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) or, under certain circumstances, a substitute rating agency selected by us as a replacement for Moody’s or S&P, as the case may be (a “Substitute Rating Agency”), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the respective series of the 2014 Senior Notes such that the adjusted rating is below investment grade. Unlike the 2014 Senior Notes, the interest rate for each series of the 2019 Senior Notes will not be subject to such adjustments. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, we entered into a series of forward contracts (the “2018 Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark interest rate with notional amount of $500.0 million in aggregate. In October 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the 2014 Senior Notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate. For additional details, refer to Note 17, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and Note 8 “Debt” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.The original discounts on the 2019 Senior Notes and the 2014 Senior Notes amounted to $6.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and are being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year for the 2014 Senior Notes and semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year for the 2019 Senior Notes. The indenture for the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of Senior Notes by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch Inc., unless we have exercised our rights to redeem the Senior Notes of such series, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s Senior Notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”). In the Change of Control Offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase.As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.Revolving Credit Facility:In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) providing for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Facility. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. In November 2018, we entered into an Incremental Facility, Extension and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”), which amends the Credit Agreement to (a) extend the Maturity Date (the “Maturity Date”) from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Amendment. After giving effect to the Amendment, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement are $1.00 billion. During the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we made borrowings of $900.0 million from the Revolving Credit Facility as part of the funding for the Orbotech Acquisition, which were paid in full in the same quarter. As of June 30, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.We may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility until the Maturity Date, at which time such Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans under such facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid. We may prepay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. 56Table of ContentsBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at either: (i) the Alternative Base Rate (“ABR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 0 bps to 75 bps, or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps. The spreads under ABR and LIBOR are subject to adjustment in conjunction with credit rating downgrades or upgrades. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps, subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating. As of June 30, 2019, we pay an annual commitment fee of 12.5 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility.The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis of 3.00 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions. As of June 30, 2019, we elected to increase the maximum allowed leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 following the Orbotech Acquisition.We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2019 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 14.27 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 1.80 to 1.00). Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.Contractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 and thereafter OthersDebt obligations(1)$3,450,000 $250,000 $— $500,000 $— $— $2,700,000 $—Interest payment associated with alldebt obligations(2)1,653,037 152,925 146,942 136,630 126,317 125,581 964,642 —Purchase commitments(3)631,128 621,401 7,405 1,405 423 226 268 —Income taxespayable(4)139,603 — — — — — — 139,603Operating leases103,571 30,296 22,250 16,217 11,878 7,912 15,018 —Cash long-term incentive program(5)179,346 67,831 58,307 34,884 18,324 — — —Pension obligations(6)38,415 2,327 2,144 2,806 2,950 5,257 22,931 —Executive DeferredSavings Plan(7)208,926 — — — — — — 208,926Transition tax payable(8)283,143 8,643 26,143 26,143 26,143 49,018 147,053 —Liability for employee rights upon retirement(9)52,108 — — — — — — 52,108Other(10)7,340 3,991 1,696 1,159 418 76 — —Total obligations$6,746,617 $1,137,414 $264,887 $719,244 $186,453 $188,070 $3,849,912 $400,637__________________ (1)Represents $3.45 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2049.(2)The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes payable included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable interest rate for each series of Senior Notes. Our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above. The interest payment under the Revolving Credit Facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 12.5 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. Our future interest payments for the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to change due to any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating. 57Table of Contents(3)Represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with goods, services and other assets in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.(4)Represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest.

For additional details, refer to Note 9, “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.We have adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in three or four equal installments. For additional details, refer to Note 9, “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods and services.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2019 2018 2017Receivables sold under factoring agreements$193,089 $217,462 $152,509Proceeds from sales of LCs$95,436 $5,511 $48,780 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $50.8 million, of which $44.7 million had been issued as of June 30, 2019, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe, Israel, and Asia. 58Table of ContentsWorking Capital:Working capital was $2.55 billion as of June 30, 2019, which represents a decrease of $788.1 million compared to our working capital as of June 30, 2018. As of June 30, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.74 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions, and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $1.00 billion Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2019 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRatingFitchBBB+Moody’sBaa1Standard & Poor’sBBBFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, material acquisitions and changes in our business strategy.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of June 30, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. Refer to Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to indemnification obligations. 59Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2019. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2019, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $813.5 million These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2019, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $4.3 million.In March 2019 and November 2014, we issued $1.20 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively, (each, a “2019 Senior Notes”, a “2014 Senior Notes”, and collectively the “Senior Notes”) aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior, unsecured long-term notes. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2019, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes were $3.70 billion and $3.45 billion, respectively, due in various fiscal years ranging from 2020 to 2049. Additionally, the interest expense for the 2014 Senior Notes is subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. Following a rating change below investment grade, the stated interest rate for each series of the 2014 Senior Notes may increase between 25 bps to 100 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. Refer to Note 8, “Debt” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7 for additional details. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor, semiconductor-related, and electronics industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. As of June 30, 2019, if our credit rating was downgraded below investment grade by Moody’s and S&P, the maximum potential increase to our annual interest expense on the 2014 Senior Notes, considering a 200 bps increase to the stated interest rate for each series of our 2014 Senior Notes, is estimated to be approximately $41.7 million. Unlike the 2014 Senior Notes, the interest rate for each series of the 2019 Senior Notes will not be subject to such adjustments.In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. In November 2018, we entered into an Incremental Facility, Extension and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”), which amends the Credit Agreement to (a) extend the Maturity Date (the “Maturity Date”) from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Amendment. After giving effect to the Amendment, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement are $1.00 billion. As of June 30, 2019, we do not have any outstanding floating rate debts that are subject to an increase in interest rates. We are obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 12.5 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility which is subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, depending upon the then effective credit rating. As of June 30, 2019, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $0.8 million. See Note 5, “Marketable Securities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2019.As of June 30, 2019, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $97.6 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2019, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $98.3 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $48.3 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. 60Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:56.384874

This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”). Pursuant to the FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, discussions related to the changes in results of operations from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2018 have been omitted. Such omitted discussion can be found under Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, filed with the SEC.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYWe are a global leader in process control and a supplier of process-enabling solutions and services for the data era.We are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor, PCB and Display markets. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading edge equipment, software and services that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor, PCB and Display industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including advanced packaging, light emitting diode (“LED”), power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (“reticle” or “mask”) and hard disk drive manufacturers around the world. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment in order to control nanometric level manufacturing processes. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers’ spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand or expansion plans. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets - memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influence the level and pattern of our customers’ spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has historically been cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial and automotive products has resulted over the long term in a favorable demand environment for our process control and yield management solutions, particularly in the foundry and logic markets, which have higher levels of process control adoption than the memory market. The Data Era is creating multiple drivers for growth, with increased demand for advanced and lower cost chips for Artificial Intelligence (""AI""), 5G connectivity, virtual interaction, electric cars, advanced driver assistance automotive systems (""ADAS""), Internet of Things (""IoT"") and mobile devices.The semiconductor and electronics industries have also been characterized by constant technological innovation. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications that fuel demand for process control equipment.The demand for our products and our revenue levels are driven by our customers’ needs to solve the process challenges that they face as they adopt new technologies required to fabricate advanced ICs that are incorporated into sophisticated devices. Our customers continuously seek to increase yields and enhance the efficiency of their manufacturing processes, including by improving their manufacturing, inspection, testing and repair capabilities.40Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years(1): Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands, except diluted net income per share)202020192018Total revenues$5,806,424 $4,568,904 $4,036,701 Costs of revenues$2,449,561 $1,869,377 $1,446,041 Gross margin percentage58 %59 %64 %Net income attributable to KLA(2)$1,216,785 $1,175,617 $802,265 Diluted net income per share attributable to KLA$7.70 $7.49 $5.10 __________________ (1)On February 20, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Orbotech for total consideration of approximately $3.26 billion.

The severity and duration of these economic repercussions remain largely unknown and ultimately will depend on many factors, including the speed and effectiveness of the containment efforts throughout the world. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact demand for our products depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and very difficult to predict, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and actions to contain and treat its impacts. While all of our global sites are currently operational, our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates.From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively implemented preventative protocols intended to safeguard our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, and ensure business continuity in the event government restrictions or severe outbreaks impact our operations at certain sites. We remain committed to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, and are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.Our efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic include the following:•We have put health screenings in place, required social distancing, and have established employee separation protocols at our facilities. We have also suspended non-essential business travel and require team members to work from home to the extent possible. Where work from home is not possible, all on-site team members must pass through thermal scanning equipment to ensure they do not have an elevated body temperature and must wear a mask at all times.•We have developed strategies to address our responsiveness and ability to send engineers into customer facilities to provide support services.•We have evaluated our supply chain and communicated with our suppliers to identify supply gaps and taken steps to ensure continuity. We continue to monitor the supply chain and work with our suppliers to identify and mitigate potential gaps to ensure continuity of supply.•We are evaluating all our construction projects across our global operations and enacting protocols to enhance the safety of our employees, suppliers, and contractors.•We have developed strategies and are implementing measures to respond to a variety of potential economic scenarios, such as limitations on new hiring and reductions in discretionary spending.•We are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate, and continuing to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements, relevant regulations, industry standards, and best practices to help safeguard our team members, while safely continuing operations to the extent possible at our sites across the globe.We believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, while allowing us to safely continue operations, but we cannot predict how the steps we, our team members, government entities, suppliers, or customers take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, outlook, or results of operations.41Table of ContentsWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in freight costs due in large part to reduced air traffic, which impacts gross margin, as well as decreases in travel costs which reduce our cost structure. As of the date of this report, we cannot predict with certainty any other effects the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, or on our financial results for the remainder of calendar 2020.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition. We primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries, maintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services and the sale of spare parts. Our portfolio also includes yield enhancement and production solutions used by manufacturers of printed circuit boards, flat panel displays, advanced packaging, microelectromechanical systems and other electronic components. Our solutions provide a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products, which are accompanied by a flexible portfolio of services to enable our customers to maintain the performance and productivity of the solutions purchased. Our solutions are generally not sold with a right of return, nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers.We account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectibility of consideration is probable. Our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes. The revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer. Our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. A product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The transaction consideration, including any sales incentives, is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”) for each distinct product or service. Management considers a variety of factors to determine the SSP, such as historical standalone sales of products and services, discounting strategies and other observable data. From time to time, our contracts are modified to account for additional, or to change existing, performance obligations. Our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively.Product RevenueWe recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. We use judgment to evaluate whether the control has transferred by considering several indicators, including:•whether we have a present right to payment;•the customer has legal title;•the customer has physical possession;•the customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership; and•the customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the customer has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory).Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer. In circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance, the portion of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install product is deferred and recognized upon acceptance.42Table of ContentsWe enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers. We adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives. These credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreed-upon incentive rate. The estimate is updated at each reporting period.We offer perpetual and term licenses for software products. The primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software, while the functionality and the features of the software are the same. Software is generally bundled with post-contract customer support (“PCS”), which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. Revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time, when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from PCS is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Services and Spare Parts RevenueThe majority of product sales include a standard 6 to 12-month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers. The customers may also purchase extended warranty for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale. We have concluded that the standard 12-month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations for most of our products. The estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us.Additionally, we offer product maintenance and support services, which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale. Revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed. We also sell spare parts, revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer.Installation services include connecting and validating configuration of the product. In addition, several testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to customer specifications. Revenues from product installation are deferred and recognized at a point in time, once installation is complete.Significant JudgmentsOur contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation. Determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements. We typically estimate the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a standalone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we use information such as the size of the customer, geographic region, as well as customization of the products in determining the SSP. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors, including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. While changes in the allocation of SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations.Although the products are generally not sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement. These credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available.As outlined above, we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and considers the several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer. Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer.Contract Assets/LiabilitiesThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment. Contract assets primarily relate to the value of 43Table of Contentsproducts and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional.A contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance. The contract liabilities represent (1) deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which the control has not been transferred to the customers, and (2) deferred service revenue, which is recorded when we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services, and maintenance and other service contracts.Contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, including assumptions associated with the technology migration curve, estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets, and discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.The fair value of IPR&D is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the IPR&D assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of IPR&D is recorded to research and development expenses. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of 44Table of Contentswhich we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to record additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans. We account for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors. Compensation expense for restricted stock units with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, or when a grant contains a market condition, the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the award’s expected life, the price volatility of the underlying stock, as well as the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date of each award. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 15 “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets - Impairment Assessments. We review goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Pursuant to the authoritative guidance, we make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to those reporting units, which determines the carrying values for each reporting unit. When assessing goodwill for impairment, an initial assessment of qualitative factors determines whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Judgments related to qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions; industry and market considerations; cost factors; overall financial performance; relevant entity-specific events; a sustained decrease in share price; and other events affecting the reporting units. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill. If the former is lower, goodwill is written down by the excess amount, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. See Note 7 ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"" of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the market approach when deemed appropriate and the necessary information is available, or the income approach which uses discounted cash flow (""DCF"") analysis, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. The WACC used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts. The market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies.We review purchased finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are no longer appropriate. We determine whether finite-lived intangible assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest-level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived assets' carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. The qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to 45Table of Contentscalculating its fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are in-process research and development (""IPR&D"") intangible assets.Any impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and net asset value in the quarter in which we recognize the impairment charge. See Note 7 ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"" of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which the law is enacted.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.We record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for U.S. operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings.Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. This income will effectively be taxed at a 10.5% tax rate in general. As a result, our deferred tax assets and liabilities were being evaluated to determine if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of GILTI provisions that are effective for us after the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, or should the tax on GILTI provisions be recognized as period costs in each year incurred. We elected to account for GILTI as a component of current period tax expense starting from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or an impairment charge is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period during which any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.46Table of ContentsRecent Accounting Pronouncements For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those recently adopted and the expected dates of adoption as well as estimated effects, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements of those not yet adopted, see Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202020192018FY20 vs. FY19FY19 vs. FY18Revenues:Product$4,328,725 $3,392,243 $3,160,671 $936,482 28 %$231,572 7 %Service1,477,699 1,176,661 876,030 301,038 26 %300,631 34 %Total revenues$5,806,424 $4,568,904 $4,036,701 $1,237,520 27 %$532,203 13 %Costs of revenues$2,449,561 $1,869,377 $1,446,041 $580,184 31 %$423,336 29 %Gross margin percentage58%59%64%(1)%(5)%Product revenuesOur business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period.The increase in product revenues by 28% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to product revenue from our newly acquired Orbotech business and increased investments from our foundry and logic customers, partially offset by a lower products shipments to customers in the memory business.Service revenuesService revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The increase in service revenues by 26% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to service revenues from our newly acquired Orbotech business and an increase in the number of customers requesting installations.

The increase in revenues from our Specialty Semiconductor Process, PCB, Display and Component Inspection and Other segments is primarily driven by full year results for the year-ended June 30, 2020 compared to partial year results for the year-ended June 30, 2019 and relates to the Orbotech business which was acquired in February of 2019.Revenues - Top CustomersThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues primarily in Semiconductor Process Control segment for the indicated periods:Year ended June 30,202020192018Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Revenues by regionRevenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)202020192018Taiwan$1,566,823 27 %$1,105,726 24 %$636,363 16 %China1,457,579 25 %1,215,807 27 %643,033 16 %Korea982,171 17 %584,091 13 %1,178,601 29 %Japan670,287 12 %581,529 13 %638,358 16 %United States657,550 11 %596,452 13 %494,330 12 %Europe and Israel318,483 5 %305,924 7 %300,883 7 %Rest of Asia153,531 3 %179,375 3 %145,133 4 %Total$5,806,424 100 %$4,568,904 100 %$4,036,701 100 %A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue.Gross marginOur gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products, including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions. 48Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageFiscal year ended June 30, 201864.1 %Revenue volume of products and services(1.0)%Mix of products and services sold0.7 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies(1.6)%Other service and manufacturing costs(0.5)%Impact from acquisition of Orbotech(2.6)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 201959.1 %Revenue volume of products and services1.5 %Mix of products and services sold(0.8)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies0.5 %Intangible Amortization(1.6)%Other service and manufacturing costs(0.8)%Fiscal year ended June 30, 202057.9 %Changes in gross margin percentage, which are driven by the revenue volume of products and services, reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes average customer pricing, customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Changes in gross margin percentage from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings, and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments from business combinations. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements, and amortization of intangible assets. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.The decrease in our gross margin from 59.1% to 57.9% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily attributable to an increase in amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Orbotech, unfavorable mix of products and services sold, and an increase in service and manufacturing costs. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable impact from higher revenue volume of products and services.Segment gross margin(1) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202020192018FY20 vs. FY19FY19 vs. FY18Segment gross margin:Semiconductor Process Control$3,028,167 $2,590,434 $2,554,223 $437,733 17 %$36,211 1 %Specialty Semiconductor Process183,641 78,800 — 104,841 133 %78,800 (3)PCB, Display and Component Inspection(2)315,723 155,765 38,428 159,958 103 %117,337 (3)Other(63) 1,102 — (1,165) (106)%1,102 (3)$3,527,468 $2,826,101 $2,592,651 $701,367 25 %$233,450 9 %_________________ (1) Segment gross margin is calculated as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues and excludes corporate allocations and the effects of foreign exchange rates, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments, and acquisition related costs.

As technological innovation is essential to our success, we may incur significant costs associated with R&D projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs, and other expenses.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $50.2 million as a result of additional engineering headcount, higher employee benefit costs and higher variable compensation and an increase of $100.2 million of expenses from the Orbotech business, partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense of $4.3 million.Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202020192018FY20 vs. FY19FY19 vs. FY18SG&A expenses$734,149 $599,124 $442,304 $135,025 23 %$156,820 35 %SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues13 %13 %11 %— %2 %SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $33.7 million as a result of additional headcount, higher employee benefit costs and variable compensation, an increase in depreciation expense of $12.5 million and expenses related to the Orbotech business of $115.6 million, which includes an increase in amortization expense for purchased intangible assets of $30.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related expenses of $29.1 million, lower travel-related expenses of $11.6 million, and $10.9 million of stock-based compensation expense from acceleration of certain equity awards for Orbotech employees recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2019. Goodwill ImpairmentWe performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of February 28, 2020 and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill for the Wafer Inspection and Patterning, Global Service and Support, and Component Inspection reporting units. However, due to the downward revision of financial outlook for the Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB and Display reporting units as well as the impact of elevated risk and macroeconomic slowdown driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for these reporting units. As a result, we recorded $144.2 million and $112.5 million in impairment charges in the Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB and Display reporting units, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2020. For our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we performed our annual qualitative assessment of goodwill during the third quarter and concluded that there was no impairment.50Table of ContentsRestructuring ChargesIn September 2019, management approved a plan to streamline our organization and business processes that included the reduction of workforce, which is expected to be completed in the second half of our fiscal year 2021, primarily in our PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment. Restructuring charges were $7.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, and the accrual for restructuring charges was $5.7 million at June 30, 2020. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges in future periods in connection with the completion of our workforce reduction. For additional information refer to Note 20 “Restructuring Charges” in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Interest Expense and Other Expense (Income), Net Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)202020192018Interest expense$160,274 $124,604 $114,376 Other expense (income), net$2,678 $(31,462) $(30,482) Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues3 %3 %3 %Other expense (income), net as a percentage of total revenues— %1 %1 %The increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, was primarily due to interest on the $1.20 billion Senior Notes issued in March 2019.Other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, and interest-related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our invested cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The decrease in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of $17.2 million, other impairments of $8.8 million, and foreign exchange losses of $4.6 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell certain core assets of our non-strategic solar energy business. This transaction resulted in a loss of $1.9 million, which was included in other expense (income) in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2020.Loss on Extinguishment of DebtFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, loss on extinguishment of debt reflected a pre-tax net loss of $22.5 million associated with the redemption of our $500.0 million of the Senior Notes due 2021, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses. We had no loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended June 30, 2019.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes:Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)202020192018Income before income taxes$1,316,711 $1,296,231 $1,455,931 Provision for income taxes$101,686 $121,214 $653,666 Effective tax rate7.7 %9.4 %44.9 %Tax expense was lower as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to the impact of the following items:51Table of Contents•Tax expense decreased by $13.7 million relating to an increase in the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020; •Tax expense decreased by $6.9 million relating to a decrease in the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020;•Tax expense decreased by $23.6 million relating to the impact of an increase in the proportion of KLA’s earnings +generated in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020; and•Tax expense decreased by $34.3 million relating to the impact of an internal restructuring during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020; partially offset by•Tax expense increased by $53.9 million relating to a $256.6 million goodwill impairment charge, which is non-deductible for income tax. Our effective tax rate during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Act”), which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The following items are the tax impact as a result of the Act: •Tax expense decreased by $50.9 million relating to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 28.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and tax expense decreased by $49.9 million relating to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 28.1% to 21.0% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% as of January 1, 2018. The decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% results in a blended statutory tax rate of 28.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018;•Tax expense increased by $339.6 million relating to the one-time transition tax recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 on our total post-1986 earnings and profits (“E&P”) of which, prior to the enactment of the Act, was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes;•Tax expense increased by $102.1 million relating to the one-time re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 based on the Act’s new corporate tax rate of 21.0%; and•Tax expense decreased by $19.3 million relating to the transition tax liability during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world. We are subject to federal income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and are under United States income tax examination for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We are subject to state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We are also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore and Israel, for all years beginning from the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. We are under audit in Germany related to Orbotech for the years ended December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2015. We are also under audit in Israel related to KLA for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2019. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.In May 2017, Orbotech received an assessment from the Israel Tax Authority (“ITA”) with respect to its fiscal years 2012 through 2014 (the “Assessment”, and the “Audit Period”, respectively), for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all net operating losses (“NOLs”) available through the end of 2014, of approximately NIS 229.0 million (equivalent to approximately $66.0 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the Israeli consumer price index as of date of the issuance of the Tax Decrees).On August 31, 2018, Orbotech filed an objection in respect of the tax assessment (the “Objection”). The ITA completed the second stage of the audit, in which the claims Orbotech raised in the Objection were examined by different personnel at the ITA. In addition, the ITA examined additional items during this second stage of the audit. As Orbotech and the ITA did not reach an agreement during the second stage, the ITA issued Tax Decrees to Orbotech on August 28, 2019 (“Tax Decrees”) for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all NOLs available through the end of 2014, of approximately NIS 257 million 52Table of Contents(equivalent to approximately $74 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the Israeli consumer price index as of the date of the issuance of the Tax Decrees). These Tax Decrees replaced the Assessment. We believe that our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of these Tax Decrees. Orbotech filed a notice of appeal with respect to the above Tax Decrees with the District Court of Tel Aviv on September 26, 2019. On February 27, 2020 the ITA filed its arguments in support of the Tax Decrees. Orbotech filed the grounds of appeal with respect to the above Tax Decrees on July 30, 2020. The ITA and Orbotech are continuing discussions in an effort to resolve this matter in a mutually agreeable manner.In connection with the above, there is an ongoing criminal investigation in Israel against Orbotech, certain of its employees and its tax consultant. On April 11, 2018, Orbotech received a “suspect notification letter” (dated March 28, 2018) from the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office (Fiscal and Financial). In the letter, it was noted that the investigation file was transferred from the Assessment Investigation Officer to the District Attorney’s Office. The letter further states that the District Attorney’s Office has not yet made a decision regarding submission of an indictment against Orbotech; and that if after studying the case, a decision is made to consider prosecuting Orbotech, Orbotech will receive an additional letter, and within 30 days, Orbotech may present its arguments to the District Attorney’s Office as to why it should not be indicted. On October 27, 2019, we received a request for additional information from the District Attorney's Office. We will continue to monitor the progress of the District Attorney’s Office investigation; however, we cannot anticipate when the review of the case will be completed and what will be the results thereof. We intend to cooperate with the District Attorney’s Office to enable them to conclude their investigation.On March 27, 2020, The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law which included several tax relief provisions. As a result of the CARES Act, we have deferred payment of certain payroll taxes to the federal government through December 31, 2022 and accelerated the tax deduction of qualified improvement property. The provisions of the CARES Act do not have a material impact to our liquidity and we are not expecting a material tax refund.

The increase is mainly due to net proceeds from our 2020 Senior Notes of $0.74 billion, net proceeds from our revolving credit facility of $0.45 billion and cash generated from operations of $1.78 billion, partially offset by repayments of debt of $1.17 billion, payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $0.52 billion, stock repurchases of $0.83 billion and capital expenditures of $0.15 billion. As of June 30, 2020, $0.82 billion of our $1.98 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $0.53 billion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 1%-22% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of $0.29 billion of the $0.82 53Table of Contentsbillion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense.Cash Dividends and Special Cash Dividend:The total amounts of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $522.4 million, $469.4 million and $395.6 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.75 to $0.85 per share that was instituted during the three months ended December 31, 2019. The amounts of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with dividend equivalent rights were $8.3 million and $7.3 million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested RSUs as described in Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 6, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per share. Refer to Note 21 “Subsequent Events” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to June 30, 2020.On November 19, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of the special cash dividend was part of our leveraged recapitalization transaction under which the special cash dividend was financed through a combination of existing cash and proceeds from the debt financing disclosed in Note 8 “Debt” that was completed during the three months ended December 31, 2014. The total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by us at the declaration date was substantially paid out during the three months ended December 31, 2014, except for the aggregate special cash dividend of $43.0 million that was accrued for the unvested RSUs to be paid when such underlying unvested RSUs vest. Payments of the special cash dividend with respect to vested restricted stock units during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $2.9 million and $6.4 million, respectively, and by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019 all of the special cash dividend accrued with respect to outstanding RSUs had vested and been paid in full. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we historically have not declared any special cash dividends. Stock Repurchases:The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset shares issued in connection with the purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) program and the vesting of employee restricted stock units. Fiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019Cash Flows from Operating Activities:We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 increased by $0.63 billion compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, from $1.15 billion to $1.78 billion, primarily as a result of the following factors:•An increase in collections of approximately $1.67 billion mainly driven by higher shipments and inclusion of Orbotech during the entire 2020 fiscal year;•Lower merger and acquisition costs of approximately $29.0 million; partially offset by the following: •A decrease in interest income of approximately $16.0 million mainly due to lower average cash balances and interest rates; •An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $619.0 million mainly due to the inclusion of Orbotech during the entire 2020 fiscal year;•An increase in employee-related payments of approximately $391.0 million mainly due to the inclusion of Orbotech during the entire 2020 fiscal year;•An increase of debt interest payments of approximately $47.0 million related to Senior Notes issued in March 2019 for the Orbotech acquisition and early redemption of 2021 Senior Notes.Cash Flows from Investing Activities:Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was $0.26 billion compared to net cash used by investing activities of $1.18 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to a 54Table of Contentsdecrease in cash paid for business acquisitions of $1.73 billion, partially offset by higher net purchases of marketable securities of $0.79 billion. Cash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, from $0.36 billion to $1.30 billion. This change was mainly impacted by lower net proceeds from borrowings of $1.16 billion, partially offset by a decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases of $0.27 billion.Senior Notes:In February 2020, March 2019 and November 2014, we issued $750.0 million, $1.20 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively (each a ""2020 Senior Notes"", a “2019 Senior Notes”, a “2014 Senior Notes”, and collectively the “Senior Notes”), aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes. In February 2020 and October 2019, we repaid $500.0 million and $250.0 million of Senior Notes, respectively.In February 2020, S&P upgraded its credit rating of the Company to “BBB+” and revised its outlook to stable, which permanently removed interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 Senior Notes became fixed. The interest rate for each series of the 2020 Senior Notes and 2019 Senior Notes are not subject to adjustments.In January 2020, we entered into a series of forward contracts (“2020 Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the 30-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the 2020 Senior Notes. The 2020 Rate Lock Agreements had a notional amount of $350.0 million in aggregate and matured in the same quarter. The 2020 Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of the pricing of the $750.0 million of 3.300% Senior Notes due in 2050 and we recorded the fair value of $21.5 million as a loss within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“OCI”) as of March 31, 2020, which will be amortized over the life of the debt. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, we entered into a series of forward contracts (the “2018 Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark interest rate with notional amount of $500.0 million in aggregate. In October 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (“benchmark rate”) on a portion of the 2014 Senior Notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate. For additional details, refer to Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and Note 8 “Debt” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The original discounts on the 2020 Senior Notes, the 2019 Senior Notes and the 2014 Senior Notes amounted to $0.3 million, $6.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and are being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable as follows: semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year for the 2020 Senior Notes; semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year for the 2019 Senior Notes; and semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year for the 2014 Senior Notes. The indenture for the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of Senior Notes by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch Inc., unless we have exercised our rights to redeem the Senior Notes of such series, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s Senior Notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”). In the Change of Control Offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase.As of June 30, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.Revolving Credit Facility:In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) providing for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Facility. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. In November 2018, we entered into an Incremental Facility, Extension and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”), which amends the Credit Agreement to (a) extend the Maturity Date (the “Maturity Date”) from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Amendment. After giving effect to the Amendment, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement are $1.00 billion. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we borrowed $450.0 million from the Revolving Credit Facility and made a principal payment of $400.0 million. As of June 30, 2020, we had outstanding $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.55Table of ContentsWe may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility until the Maturity Date, at which time such Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans under such facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid. We may prepay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at either: (i) the Alternative Base Rate (“ABR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 0 bps to 75 bps, or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps. The spreads under ABR and LIBOR are subject to adjustment in conjunction with credit rating downgrades or upgrades. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps, subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating. As of June 30, 2020, we elected to pay interest on the borrowed amount under the Revolving Credit Facility at LIBOR plus a spread of 112.5 bps and we pay an annual commitment fee of 12.5 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility.The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis of 3.00 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions. As of June 30, 2020, our maximum allowed leverage ratio was 3.50 to 1.00.We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2020 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 13.97 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 1.56 to 1.00). Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2021.Contractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2020: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total202120222023202420252026 and thereafterOthersDebt obligations(1)$3,500,000 $— $— $— $50,000 $1,250,000 $2,200,000 $— Interest payments associated with all debt obligations(2)2,087,338 151,118 151,067 150,331 149,800 120,738 1,364,284 — Purchase commitments(3)896,928 887,851 8,397 453 227 — — — Income taxes payable(4)172,674 — — — — — — 172,674 Operating leases105,743 30,628 22,750 15,410 10,221 8,508 18,226 — Cash long-term incentive program(5)197,116 78,404 56,573 41,039 21,100 — — — Pension obligations(6)42,482 3,014 2,955 3,047 4,317 3,758 25,391 — Executive Deferred Savings Plan(7)215,167 — — — — — — 215,167 Transition tax payable(8)274,498 26,143 26,143 26,143 49,018 65,357 81,694 — Liability for employee rights upon retirement(9)52,898 — — — — — — 52,898 Other(10)8,310 3,287 2,600 1,612 811 — — — Total obligations$7,553,154 $1,180,445 $270,485 $238,035 $285,494 $1,448,361 $3,689,595 $440,739 __________________ (1)Represents $3.45 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2050 and $50.0 million principal amount of Revolving Credit Facility due in fiscal year 2024.56Table of Contents(2)The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes payable included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable interest rate for each series of Senior Notes.

For additional details, refer to Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.We have adopted a cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) program for many of our employees as part of our employee compensation program. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in three or four equal installments. For additional details, refer to Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LCs”), without recourse, received from customers in payment for goods and services.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs for the indicated periods:Year ended June 30,(In thousands)202020192018Receivables sold under factoring agreements$293,006 $193,089 $217,462 Proceeds from sales of LCs$59,036 $95,436 $5,511 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $81.7 million, of which $68.7 million had been issued as of June 30, 2020, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe, Israel, and Asia.57Table of ContentsWorking Capital:Working capital was $3.02 billion as of June 30, 2020, which represents an increase of $477.2 million compared to our working capital as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.98 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions, and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $1.00 billion Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2020 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRatingFitchBBB+Moody’sBaa1Standard & Poor’sBBB+Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, material acquisitions and changes in our business strategy.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of June 30, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. Refer to Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to indemnification obligations.58Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2020. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2020, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $717.5 million These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2020, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $4.7 million.In February 2020, March 2019 and November 2014, we issued $750.0 million, $1.20 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively, (each, a “2020 Senior Notes”, “2019 Senior Notes”, a “2014 Senior Notes”, and collectively the “Senior Notes”) aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior, unsecured long-term notes. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2020, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes were $4.01 billion and $3.45 billion, respectively, due in various fiscal years ranging from 2024 to 2050. The interest expense for the 2014 Senior Notes was subject to interest rate adjustments following downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. In February 2020, S&P upgraded its credit rating of the Company to “BBB+” and revised its outlook to stable, which permanently removed interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 Senior Notes became fixed. Unlike the 2014 Senior Notes, the interest rate for each series of the 2019 Senior Notes are not subject to such adjustments.In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. In November 2018, we entered into an Incremental Facility, Extension and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”), which amends the Credit Agreement to (a) extend the Maturity Date (the “Maturity Date”) from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Amendment. After giving effect to the Amendment, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement are $1.00 billion. As of June 30, 2020, we had outstanding $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2020, we elected to pay interest on the borrowed amount under the Revolving Credit Facility at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. The fair value of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with changes in interest rates. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 12.5 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility which is subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, depending upon the then-effective credit rating. As of June 30, 2020, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 bps, the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately $0.5 million as it relates to our borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally as of June 30, 2020, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $0.9 million. See Note 5 “Marketable Securities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2020.As of June 30, 2020, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $89.4 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2020, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $88.7 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $39.0 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:40.825033
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2021,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (see “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”). Discussions and analysis of fiscal year 2020 as compared against fiscal year 2019 have been omitted and can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, filed with the SEC.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYWe are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor and related electronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, support R&D and manufacturing of ICs, wafers and reticles. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects, helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges and to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost. We also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of PCBs, FPDs, Specialty Semiconductor Devices and other electronic components, including advanced packaging, LED, power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor device manufacturing markets: Memory and Foundry/Logic. The pervasive and increasing needs for semiconductors in many consumer and industrial products, the rapid proliferation of new applications for more advanced semiconductor devices, and the increasing complexity associated with leading edge semiconductor manufacturing drives demand for our process control and yield management solutions. Other demand trends include the growth of end-market drivers such as AI, the deployment of 5G telecommunications technology and associated high-end mobile devices, the electrification and digitalization of the automotive industry, the revival of personal computer demand and associated innovations to support remote work, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment, and the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”). The favorable end market dynamics are driving our customers to make increased investments in our process control and yield management solutions as part of their overall capital investment plans. These trends also drive demand for our other products such as those used in the PCB, FPD and Specialty Semiconductor manufacturing, where the increase in technology complexity is expected to continue and further accelerate as more devices become interconnected and dependent on other electronic devices. As a result of these factors, we saw a general strengthening of demand for our products throughout fiscal 2021. Our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, has become increasingly concentrated, so large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more earnings volatility. We are organized into four reportable segments: •Semiconductor Process Control: A comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products as well as related service offerings that help IC manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the semiconductor fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production.•Specialty Semiconductor Process: Advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers.•PCB, Display and Component Inspection: a range of inspection, testing and measurement, and DI for patterning products used by manufacturers of PCBs, FPDs, advanced packaging, MEMS, and other electronic components.•Other: products that do not fall into the three segments above.A majority of our revenues are derived from outside the United States, and include geographic regions such as Taiwan, China, Korea, Japan, Europe and Israel, and Rest of Asia. China is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. Additionally, a significant portion of global FPD and PCB manufacturing has migrated to China. Government initiatives are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting investment from semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the United States. Although China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector, Commerce has added certain China-based entities to the U.S. Entity List, restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without a license. In addition, Commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements 40Table of Contentson China-based customers engaged in military end uses, as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to Huawei or its affiliates. While these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations to date, such actions by the U.S. government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers and adversely affect our business.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years(1): Year Ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands, except diluted net income per share)202120202019Total revenues$6,918,734 $5,806,424 $4,568,904 Costs of revenues$2,772,165 $2,449,561 $1,869,377 Gross margin60 %58 %59 %Net income attributable to KLA(2)$2,078,292 $1,216,785 $1,175,617 Diluted net income per share attributable to KLA$13.37 $7.70 $7.49 __________________ (1)On February 20, 2019, we completed the Orbotech Acquisition for total consideration of approximately $3 billion.

For additional details, refer to Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” and Note 8 “Debt” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Impact of COVID-19Events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe in calendar year 2020. Vaccinations and pandemic containment measures have now created an environment that is driving economic growth, even as pace of economic recovery remains uneven in various geographies. The resumption of growth has caused us to experience new constraints in our supply chain. Supply lead times are extended and shortages have sometimes required us to increase our purchase commitments to secure critical components on a timely basis. While all of our global sites are currently operational, any local pandemic outbreaks could require us to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates. We remain committed to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, and are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.Our efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic have included health screenings, social distancing, employee separation protocols at our facilities, suspension of non-essential business travel and work from home to the extent possible. We are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate, and continuing to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements, relevant regulations, industry standards, and best practices to help safeguard our team members, while safely continuing operations to the extent possible at our sites across the globe.We believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, while allowing us to safely continue operations. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: 41Table of ContentsRevenue Recognition. We primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries, maintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services, and the sale of spare parts. Our portfolio also includes yield enhancement and production solutions used by manufacturers of PCBs, FPDs, advanced packaging, MEMS and other electronic components. Our solutions are generally not sold with a right of return, nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers.We account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes. The revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer. Our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. A product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The transaction consideration, including any sales incentives, is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the stand-alone selling prices (“SSP”) for each distinct product or service. Management considers a variety of factors to determine the SSP, such as historical stand-alone sales of products and services, discounting strategies and other observable data. From time to time, our contracts are modified to account for additional, or to change existing, performance obligations. Our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively.Product RevenueWe recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. We use judgment to evaluate whether control has transferred by considering several indicators, including whether:•we have a present right to payment;•the customer has legal title;•the customer has physical possession;•the customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership; and•the customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the customer has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory).Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer. In circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance, the portion of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install product is deferred and recognized upon acceptance.We enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers. We adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives. These credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreed-upon incentive rate. The estimate is updated at each reporting period.We offer perpetual and term licenses for software products. The primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software, while the functionality and the features of the software are the same. Software is generally bundled with post-contract customer support (“PCS”), which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. Revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time, when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from PCS is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Services and Spare Parts RevenueThe majority of product sales include a standard six to 12-month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers. The customers may also purchase extended warranties for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale. We have concluded that the standard 12-month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations for most of our products. The estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us.42Table of ContentsAdditionally, we offer product maintenance and support services, which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale. Revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed. We also sell spare parts, revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer.Installation services include connecting and validating configuration of the product. In addition, several testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to customer specifications. Revenues from product installation are deferred and recognized at a point in time, once installation is complete.Significant JudgmentsOur contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation. Determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements. We typically estimate the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we use information such as the size of the customer, geographic region, as well as customization of the products in determining the SSP. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors, including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. While changes in the allocation of SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Although the products are generally not sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement. These credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available.As outlined above, we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and consider several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer. Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer.Contract Assets/LiabilitiesThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment. Contract assets primarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional.A contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance. The contract liabilities represent (1) deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which control has not been transferred to the customers, and (2) deferred service revenue, which is recorded when we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services, and maintenance and other service contracts.Contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, including 43Table of Contentsassumptions associated with the technology migration curve, estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets, and discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.The fair value of IPR&D is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the IPR&D assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of IPR&D is recorded to R&D expenses. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Allowance for Credit Losses. A majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor and electronics manufacturers throughout the world. We maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable and assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. However, volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans. Compensation expense for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, or when a grant contains a market condition, the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the award’s expected life, the price volatility of the underlying stock, as well as the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date of each award. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 15 “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets - Impairment Assessments. We review goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Pursuant to the authoritative guidance, we make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and allocate shared assets and liabilities to those reporting units, which determines the carrying values for each reporting unit. When assessing goodwill for impairment, an initial assessment of qualitative factors determines whether the 44Table of Contentsexistence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Judgments related to qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, relevant entity-specific events, a sustained decrease in share price and other events affecting the reporting units. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill. If the former is lower, goodwill is written down by the excess amount, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. See Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the market approach when deemed appropriate and the necessary information is available, or the income approach which uses discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. Discount rates are based on a weighted-average cost of capital (“WACC”), which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. The WACC used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts. The market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies.We review purchased finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are shorter than initially expected. We determine whether finite-lived intangible assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest-level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived assets’ carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. The qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets.Any impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and net asset value in the quarter in which we recognize the impairment charge. See Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the 45Table of Contentsweight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activities. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.We record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for U.S. operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings.Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income. The Tax Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. This income will effectively be taxed at a 10.5% tax rate in general. As a result, our deferred tax assets and liabilities were evaluated to determine if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of GILTI provisions that are effective for us after the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, or if the tax on GILTI provisions should be recognized as period costs in each year incurred. We elected to account for GILTI as a component of current period tax expense starting from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those recently adopted and the expected dates of adoption as well as estimated effects, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements of those not yet adopted, see Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenues and Gross Margin Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202120202019FY21 vs. FY20FY20 vs. FY19Revenues:Product$5,240,316 $4,328,725 $3,392,243 $911,591 21 %$936,482 28 %Service1,678,418 1,477,699 1,176,661 200,719 14 %301,038 26 %Total revenues$6,918,734 $5,806,424 $4,568,904 $1,112,310 19 %$1,237,520 27 %Costs of revenues$2,772,165 $2,449,561 $1,869,377 $322,604 13 %$580,184 31 %Gross margin60%58%59%2%(1)%Product revenuesOur business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period.The increase in product revenues by 21% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to strong demand for many of our products, especially our inspection and metrology portfolios, due to the continued growth in the 5G market and increased demand for high-performance computing and advanced packaging. These increases were partially offset by softer demand and oversupply in the display markets.Service revenuesService revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in service revenues by 14% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites.46Table of ContentsRevenues by segment(1) Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202120202019FY21 vs. FY20FY20 vs. FY19Revenues:Semiconductor Process Control$5,734,825 $4,745,446 $4,080,822 $989,379 21 %$664,624 16 %Specialty Semiconductor Process(2)369,216 329,700 151,164 39,516 12 %178,536 118 %PCB, Display and Component Inspection(2)812,620 727,451 332,810 85,169 12 %394,641 119 %Other(2)739 3,614 4,676 (2,875)(80)%(1,062)(23)%Total revenues$6,917,400 $5,806,211 $4,569,472 $1,111,189 19 %$1,236,739 27 %__________(1)Segment revenues exclude corporate allocations and the effects of foreign currency exchange rates.

Revenue from our Semiconductor Process Control segment increased by 21% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to a strong demand for many of our products, especially from our inspection and metrology portfolios. The increase in revenues from our Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB, Display and Component Inspection segments is primarily driven by continued growth in advanced packaging, high-performance computing technologies and 5G infrastructure, partially offset by softer demand and oversupply in the FPD market.Revenues - Top CustomersThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues primarily in our Semiconductor Process Control segment for the indicated periods:Year Ended June 30,202120202019Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.47Table of ContentsRevenues by regionWe have revised the fiscal 2020 revenue by geographic regions as presented below as well as in Note 19 “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information.” The revisions were to correct the amount of revenue allocated to each geographic region. These revisions had no impact on the previously issued Consolidated Balance Sheet, Statements of Operations, Statements of Cash Flows, Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) or Statements of Stockholders’ Equity as of and for the year-ended June 30, 2020 and we determined that the impact of the revisions was not material to our previously issued Consolidated Financial Statements.Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows: Year Ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)202120202019Taiwan$1,690,558 25 %$1,598,201 27 %$1,105,726 24 %China1,831,446 26 %1,495,977 26 %1,215,807 27 %Korea1,343,473 19 %911,848 16 %584,091 13 %Japan639,381 9 %660,772 11 %581,529 13 %United States765,974 11 %651,328 11 %596,452 13 %Europe and Israel396,422 6 %322,085 6 %305,924 7 %Rest of Asia251,480 4 %166,213 3 %179,375 3 %Total$6,918,734 100 %$5,806,424 100 %$4,568,904 100 %A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue.Gross marginOur gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products, including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions. The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageFiscal Year Ended June 30, 201959.1 %Revenue volume of products and services1.5 %Mix of products and services sold(0.8)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies0.5 %Intangible amortization(1.6)%Other service and manufacturing costs(0.8)%Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 202057.9 %Revenue volume of products and services1.3 %Mix of products and services sold1.2 %Other service and manufacturing costs(0.5)%Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 202159.9 %Changes in gross margin percentage, which are driven by the revenue volume of products and services, reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. Revenue is impacted by average customer pricing, customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in gross margin percentage from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings, and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments from business combinations. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements, and amortization of intangible assets. Changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support 48Table of Contentscosts, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.The increase in our gross margin from 57.9% to 59.9% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 is primarily attributable to a higher revenue volume of products and services sold and a more profitable mix of products and services sold, partially offset by an increase in service and manufacturing costs.Segment gross margin(1) Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202120202019FY21 vs. FY20FY20 vs. FY19Segment gross margin:Semiconductor Process Control$3,705,222 $3,028,167 $2,590,434 $677,055 22 %$437,733 17 %Specialty Semiconductor Process(2)206,706 183,641 78,800 23,065 13 %104,841 133 %PCB, Display and Component Inspection(2)390,571 315,723 155,765 74,848 24 %159,958 103 %Other(2)(68)(63)1,102 (5)(8)%(1,165)(106)%$4,302,431 $3,527,468 $2,826,101 $774,963 22 %$701,367 25 %_________________ (1) Segment gross margin is calculated as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues and excludes corporate allocations and the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments, and acquisition-related costs.

As technological innovation is essential to our success, we may incur significant costs associated with R&D projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs and other expenses.R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $54.5 million as a result of additional engineering headcount, higher employee benefit costs, and higher variable compensation and an increase in engineering project materials expenses of $22.6 million. This is partially offset by a decrease in travel-related expense of $11.3 million.Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our R&D. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies.49Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202120202019FY21 vs. FY20FY20 vs. FY19SG&A expenses$729,602 $734,149 $599,124 $(4,547)(1)%$135,025 23 %SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues11 %13 %13 %(2)%— %SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in travel-related expenses of $25.4 million and a decrease in depreciation and intangible amortization expense of $19.3 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $19.5 million as the result of additional headcount, higher employee benefit costs and variable compensation, an increase in facility and office expense of $9.7 million, and higher consulting costs of $6.6 million.Goodwill ImpairmentWe performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of February 28, 2021 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units, we recorded $144.2 million and $112.5 million in impairment charges in the Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB and Display reporting units, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2020. Restructuring ChargesIn September 2019, management approved a plan to streamline our organization and business processes that included the reduction of workforce, primarily in our PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment. Restructuring charges were $12.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 and included $3.9 million of non-cash charges for accelerated depreciation related to certain right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and fixed assets to be abandoned. Restructuring charges were $7.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2020.

Our effective tax rate during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was impacted by the Tax Act, which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017. The following items are the tax impacts as a result of the Tax Act: •Tax expense decreased by $49.9 million relating to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 28.1% to 21.0% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019; and•Tax expense decreased by $19.3 million relating to the transition tax liability during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, R&D credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world. We are subject to federal income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and are under U.S. income tax examination for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We are subject to U.S. state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. We are also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore and Israel, for all years beginning from the calendar year ended December 31, 2012. We are under audit in Germany related to Orbotech for the calendar years ended December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2015. We have concluded our audit in Israel related to KLA for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 to June 30, 2020. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.In May 2017, Orbotech received an assessment from the ITA with respect to its fiscal years 2012 through 2014 (the “Assessment” and the “Audit Period,” respectively), for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all net operating losses (“NOL”) available through the end of 2014, of approximately NIS 229 million (equivalent to approximately $66 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the Israeli consumer price index as of date of the issuance of the Tax Decrees).51Table of ContentsOn August 31, 2018, Orbotech filed an objection in respect of the tax assessment (the “Objection”). The ITA completed the second stage of the audit, in which the claims Orbotech raised in the Objection were examined by different personnel at the ITA. In addition, the ITA examined additional items during this second stage of the audit. As Orbotech and the ITA did not reach an agreement during the second stage, the ITA issued Tax Decrees to Orbotech on August 28, 2019 (“Tax Decrees”) for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all NOLs available through the end of 2014, of approximately NIS 257 million (equivalent to approximately $73 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the Israeli consumer price index as of the date of the issuance of the Tax Decrees). These Tax Decrees replaced the Assessment. We believe that our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of these Tax Decrees. Orbotech filed a notice of appeal with respect to the above Tax Decrees with the District Court of Tel Aviv on September 26, 2019. On February 27, 2020 the ITA filed its arguments in support of the Tax Decrees. Orbotech filed the grounds of appeal with respect to the above Tax Decrees on July 30, 2020. We are currently in the pre-trial hearing stage of the process. The ITA and Orbotech are continuing discussions in an effort to resolve this matter in a mutually agreeable manner.In connection with the above, there is an ongoing criminal investigation in Israel against Orbotech, certain of its employees and its tax consultant. On April 11, 2018, Orbotech received a “suspect notification letter” (dated March 28, 2018) from the Tel Aviv District Attorney’s Office (Fiscal and Financial). In the letter, it was noted that the investigation file was transferred from the Assessment Investigation Officer to the District Attorney’s Office. The letter further states that the District Attorney’s Office has not yet made a decision regarding submission of an indictment against Orbotech; and that if after studying the case, a decision is made to consider prosecuting Orbotech, Orbotech will receive an additional letter, and within 30 days, Orbotech may present its arguments to the District Attorney’s Office as to why it should not be indicted. On October 27, 2019, we received a request for additional information from the District Attorney's Office. We will continue to monitor the progress of the District Attorney’s Office investigation; however, we cannot anticipate when the review of the case will be completed and what will be the results thereof. We intend to cooperate with the District Attorney’s Office to enable them to conclude their investigation.In December 2020, Orbotech received an assessment from the ITA with respect to its fiscal years 2015 through 2018 (the “Second Assessment”), for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all NOLs available through the end of 2018, of approximately NIS 227 million (equivalent to approximately $68 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the Israeli consumer price index as of date of the issuance of the Second Assessment). We filed an objection to the Second Assessment with the ITA in March 2021. The objection moved the 2015-2018 audit to the second stage, in which the ITA will review the objections. We believe that our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of the Second Assessment.On March 27, 2020, The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES Act”), which includes several tax relief provisions, was signed into law. As a result of the CARES Act, we have deferred payment of certain payroll taxes to the U.S. federal government through December 31, 2022 and accelerated the tax deduction of qualified improvement property. The provisions of the CARES Act do not have a material impact to our liquidity and we are not expecting a material tax refund.

The increase is mainly due to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.19 billion, partially offset by stock repurchases of $938.6 million, cash used for payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $559.4 million, net cash usage of $288.1 million related to the purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale and trading securities and capital expenditures of $231.6 million. As of June 30, 2021, $0.96 billion of our $2.49 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $0.60 billion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 1%-22% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of $0.36 billion of the $0.96 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense.Cash Dividends and Special Cash Dividend:The total amounts of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $559.4 million, $522.4 million and $469.4 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.85 to $0.90 per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2020. The amounts of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested RSUs with dividend equivalent rights were $10.3 million and $8.3 million as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested RSUs as described in Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 5, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share. Refer to Note 21 “Subsequent Events” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to June 30, 2021.On November 19, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share on our outstanding common stock. The total amount of the special cash dividend accrued by us at the declaration date was substantially paid out during the three months ended December 31, 2014, and the final payment was made during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Other than the special cash dividend declared during the three months ended December 31, 2014, we historically have not declared any special cash dividends. Stock Repurchases:The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. The stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset the dilution from our equity incentive plans, shares issued in connection with the purchases under our ESPP and the issuance of shares in the Orbotech Acquisition, as well as to return excess cash to our stockholders. Cash Flows from Operating Activities:We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 increased by $0.41 billion compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, from $1.78 billion to $2.19 billion, primarily as a result of the following factors:•An increase in collections of approximately $1 billion mainly driven by higher shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020; partially offset by the following: •A decrease in interest income of approximately $14 million mainly due to lower interest rates during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020; •An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $445 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020;•An increase in employee-related payments of approximately $119 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020;•An increase of long-term incentive payments of approximately $12 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020;53Table of Contents•An increase in income tax payments of $131.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was $500.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $258.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This increase in cash used was mainly due to an increase in net purchases of available for sale and trading securities of $270.9 million and an increase in cash paid to purchase fixed assets of $79.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for a business acquisition of $90.1 million and an increase in cash received from sale of a business of $16.8 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, from $1.30 billion to $1.50 billion. This increase was mainly due to an increase in cash used for stock repurchases of $109.5 million, an increase in net debt repayments of $50.5 million and cash paid for dividends and dividend equivalents of $36.9 million.Senior Notes:In February 2020, March 2019 and November 2014, we issued $750.0 million, $1.20 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively (the “2020 Senior Notes,” “2019 Senior Notes” and “2014 Senior Notes,” respectively, and collectively the “Senior Notes”), aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes. In February 2020 and October 2019, we repaid $500.0 million and $250.0 million of Senior Notes, respectively.In February 2020, S&P upgraded its credit rating of the Company to “BBB+” and revised its outlook to stable, which permanently removed interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 Senior Notes became fixed. The interest rates for each series of the 2020 Senior Notes and 2019 Senior Notes are not subject to adjustments.In January 2020, we entered into a series of forward contracts (“2020 Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the 30-year treasury rate (the “benchmark interest rate” with respect to the 2020 Rate Lock Agreements) on a portion of the 2020 Senior Notes. The 2020 Rate Lock Agreements had a notional amount of $350.0 million in aggregate and matured in the same quarter. The 2020 Rate Lock Agreements were terminated on the date of the pricing of the $750.0 million of 3.300% Senior Notes due in 2050 and we recorded the fair value of $21.5 million as a loss within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“AOCI”) as of March 31, 2020, which is being amortized over the life of the debt. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, we entered into a series of forward contracts (the “2018 Rate Lock Agreements”) to lock the benchmark interest rate with notional amount of $500.0 million in aggregate. In October 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (the “benchmark interest rate” with respect to the 2014 Rate Lock Agreements) on a portion of the 2014 Senior Notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate. For additional details, refer to Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and Note 8 “Debt” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.The original discounts on the 2020 Senior Notes, the 2019 Senior Notes and the 2014 Senior Notes amounted to $0.3 million, $6.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and are being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable as follows: semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year for the 2020 Senior Notes; semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year for the 2019 Senior Notes; and semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year for the 2014 Senior Notes. The indenture for the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of Senior Notes by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, unless we have exercised our rights to redeem the Senior Notes of such series, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s Senior Notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”). In the Change of Control Offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase.As of June 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.Revolving Credit Facility:In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) providing for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Facility. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the 54Table of Contentsaggregate. In November 2018, we entered into an Incremental Facility, Extension and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”), which amended the Credit Agreement to (a) extend the Maturity Date (the “Maturity Date”) from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Amendment. After giving effect to the Amendment, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement amount to $1.00 billion. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we made a principal payment of $50.0 million. As of June 30, 2021, we had no outstanding aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.We may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility until the Maturity Date, at which time such Revolving Credit Facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans under such facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid. We may prepay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at either: (i) the Alternative Base Rate (“ABR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 0 bps to 75 bps, or (ii) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread, which ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps. The spreads under ABR and LIBOR are subject to adjustment in conjunction with credit rating downgrades or upgrades. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps, subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating. As of June 30, 2021, we elected to pay interest on the borrowed amount under the Revolving Credit Facility at LIBOR plus a spread of 100.0 bps and we pay an annual commitment fee of 10 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility.The Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. In addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis of 3.00 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions. As of June 30, 2021, our maximum allowed leverage ratio was 3.00 to 1.00.We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2021 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 18.70 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 1.18 to 1.00). Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2022.55Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021: Fiscal Year Ending June 30,(In thousands)Total202220232024202520262027 and thereafterOtherDebt obligations(1)$3,470,000 $20,000 $— $— $1,250,000 $— $2,200,000 $— Interest payments associated with alldebt obligations(2)1,933,811 150,814 150,231 149,806 120,738 91,675 1,270,547 — Purchase commitments(3)1,545,701 1,503,960 34,117 988 5,436 752 448 — Income taxespayable(4)154,034 — — — — — — 154,034 Operating leases(5)107,557 33,759 24,326 15,501 12,104 9,168 12,699 — Cash long-term incentive program(6)247,979 88,946 74,115 54,887 30,031 — — — Pension obligations(7)49,386 2,983 3,049 4,141 3,753 3,612 31,848 — Executive DeferredSavings Plan(8)268,028 — — — — — — 268,028 Transition tax payable(9)248,356 26,143 26,143 49,018 65,357 81,695 — — Liability for employee rights upon retirement(10)47,079 — — — — — — 47,079 Other(11)10,334 4,649 3,288 2,101 296 — — — Total obligations$8,082,265 $1,831,254 $315,269 $276,442 $1,487,715 $186,902 $3,515,542 $469,141 __________________ (1)Represents $3.45 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2050 and $20.0 million principal amount of Notes Payable due in fiscal year 2022.(2)The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes payable included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable interest rate for each series of Senior Notes. Our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above. The interest payment under the Revolving Credit Facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 10 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance, and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. Our future interest payments for the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to change due to any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating.(3)Represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with goods, services and other assets in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.(4)Represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.(5)Operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases, but exclude non-lease components.(6)As part of our employee compensation program, we issue cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards to many of our employees. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in three or four equal installments. The amounts in the table above are those committed under the Cash LTI Plan; the expected total payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately $209 million. For additional details, refer to Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.56Table of Contents(7)Represents an estimate of expected benefit payments up to fiscal year 2031 that was actuarially determined and excludes the minimum cash required to contribute to the plan. As of June 30, 2021, our defined benefit pension plans do not have material required minimum cash contribution obligations.(8)Represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant’s separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections.(9)Represents the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act into law on December 22, 2017.(10)Represents severance payments due upon dismissal of an employee or upon termination of employment in certain other circumstances as required under Israeli law.(11)Represents amounts committed for accrued dividends payable for quarterly cash dividends for unvested RSUs granted with dividend equivalent rights. For additional details, refer to Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LC”), without recourse, received from customers as payment for goods and services.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LC for the indicated periods:Year Ended June 30,(In thousands)202120202019Receivables sold under factoring agreements$305,565 $293,006 $193,089 Proceeds from sales of LC$133,679 $59,036 $95,436 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $75.2 million, of which $59.7 million had been issued as of June 30, 2021, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax (“VAT”) and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe, Israel, and Asia.Working Capital:Working capital was $3.59 billion as of June 30, 2021, which represents an increase of $569.3 million compared to our working capital as of June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.49 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions, and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $1.00 billion Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2021 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRatingFitchBBB+Moody’sA2S&PBBB+In June 2021, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Baa1 to A2. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries, our financial position, material acquisitions and changes in our business strategy.57Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of June 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. Refer to Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to indemnification obligations.58Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2021. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2021, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $924.7 million. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2021, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $9.6 million.The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as market interest rates fall and decrease as market interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2021, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes were $3.98 billion and $3.42 billion, respectively, due in various fiscal years ranging from 2024 to 2050. The interest expense for the 2014 Senior Notes was subject to interest rate adjustments following a downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. In February 2020, S&P upgraded its credit rating of the Company to “BBB+” and revised its outlook to stable, which permanently removed interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 Senior Notes became fixed. Unlike the 2014 Senior Notes, the interest rates for each series of the 2020 Senior Notes and 2019 Senior Notes are not subject to such adjustments.In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. In November 2018, we entered into an Incremental Facility, Extension and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”), which amends the Credit Agreement to (a) extend the Maturity Date from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Amendment. After giving effect to the Amendment, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement amount to $1.00 billion. As of June 30, 2021, we had no outstanding aggregate principal borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2020, we elected to pay interest on the borrowed amount under the Revolving Credit Facility at the LIBOR plus a spread. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. The fair value of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with changes in interest rates. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 10 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility which is subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, depending upon the then-effective credit rating. Additionally as of June 30, 2021, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $1 million. Our equity investment in a publicly traded company is subject to market price risk, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities. As of June 30, 2021, the fair value of our investment in the marketable equity security, which begun publicly trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on April 5, 2021, was $29.9 million. Assuming a decline of 50% in market prices, the aggregate value of our investment in the marketable equity security could decrease by approximately $15 million, based on the value as of June 30, 2021.See Note 5 “Marketable Securities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2021.As of June 30, 2021, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $203.5 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2021, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $198.0 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $54.5 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:33.264532
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2022,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, 35Table of Contentsincluding but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (see “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”). Discussions and analysis of fiscal year 2021 as compared against fiscal year 2020 have been omitted and can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, filed with the SEC.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYWe are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor and related electronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, support R&D and manufacturing of ICs, wafers and reticles. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects, helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges and to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost. We also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of PCBs, FPDs, Specialty Semiconductor Devices and other electronic components, including advanced packaging, LED, power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor device manufacturing markets: memory and foundry/logic. The pervasive and increasing needs for semiconductors in many consumer and industrial products, the rapid proliferation of new applications for more advanced semiconductor devices, and the increasing complexity associated with leading edge semiconductor manufacturing drives demand for our process control and yield management solutions. Other demand trends include the growth of end-market drivers such as AI, the deployment of 5G telecommunications technology and associated high-end mobile devices, the electrification and digitalization of the automotive industry, the revival of personal computer (“PC”) demand and associated innovations to support remote work, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment, and the growth of the IoT. The favorable end market dynamics are driving our customers to make increased investments in our process control and yield management solutions as part of their overall capital investment plans. These trends also drive demand for our other products such as those used in the PCB, FPD and Specialty Semiconductor manufacturing, where the increase in technology complexity is expected to continue and further accelerate as more devices become interconnected and dependent on other electronic devices. As a result of these factors, we saw a general strengthening of demand for our products throughout fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. While demand for our products remains strong, the recent macro-economic uncertainty and resulting impact on consumer demand is a development we are monitoring closely. Some of our customers, particularly in the PC and mobile device end markets, are experiencing market softening in the past few months, and we have seen memory pricing in those markets weaken as well. While our concerns are elevated, we continue to see strong demand from our customers. Any push out or cancellation of deliveries by our customers could cause earnings volatility, due to increases in risk of inventory related charges as well as the timing of revenue recognition. We are organized into four reportable segments: •Semiconductor Process Control: A comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products as well as related service offerings that help IC manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the semiconductor fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production.•Specialty Semiconductor Process: Advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers.•PCB, Display and Component Inspection: a range of inspection, testing and measurement, and direct imaging for patterning products used by manufacturers of PCBs, FPDs, advanced packaging, MEMS, and other electronic components.•Other: products that do not fall into the three segments above.A majority of our revenues are derived from outside the U.S., and include geographic regions such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Europe and Israel, and Rest of Asia. China is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. Additionally, a significant portion of global FPD and PCB manufacturing has migrated to China. Government initiatives are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting investment from semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the U.S. Although China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector, Commerce has added certain China-based entities to the U.S. Entity List, restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without a license. In addition, Commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements on China-based customers engaged in military end uses, as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to Huawei or its affiliates. While these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations to date, such actions by the U.S. government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers and adversely affect our business.36Table of ContentsThe following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year Ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands, except diluted net income per share)202220212020Total revenues$9,211,883 $6,918,734 $5,806,424 Costs of revenues$3,592,441 $2,772,165 $2,449,561 Gross margin61 %60 %58 %Net income attributable to KLA(1)$3,321,807 $2,078,292 $1,216,785 Diluted net income per share attributable to KLA$21.92 $13.37 $7.70 __________________ (1)Our net income attributable to KLA for the year ended June 30, 2020 includes a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $256.6 million and a pre-tax charge of $22.5 million as a result of the extinguishment of debt. For additional details, refer to Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” and Note 8 “Debt” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Impact of COVID-19Events surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe in calendar year 2020 and early 2021. Vaccinations and pandemic containment measures have now created an environment that is driving economic growth, even as the pace of economic recovery remains uneven in various geographies. On one hand, the semiconductor and capital equipment industry has experienced multiple growth drivers, including acceleration of the pace of virtual engagement and digitization driven by COVID-19 related travel restrictions and quarantines. On the other hand, the resumption of growth has caused us to experience new constraints in our supply chain. Supply chain lead times are extended and shortages have sometimes required us to plan further ahead and increase our purchase commitments to secure critical components on a timely basis. We continue to monitor our supply chain and work with our suppliers to identify and mitigate potential gaps to ensure continuity of supply.While all of our global manufacturing sites are currently operational, any local pandemic outbreaks or advent of new variants have required and could in the future require us to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates or due to outbreaks affecting our manufacturing employees. We remain committed to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and communities, and are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.We are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate, and continue to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements, relevant regulations, industry standards, and best practices to help safeguard our team members, while safely continuing operations to the extent possible at our sites across the globe.We may take further actions or alter our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Revenue Recognition. We primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and process-enabling solutions for the semiconductor and related electronics industries, maintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services, and the sale of spare parts. Our portfolio includes yield enhancement and production solutions for manufacturing wafers and reticles, ICs, packaging, PCBs and FPDs, as well as comprehensive support and services across our installed base. Our solutions are generally not sold with a right of return, nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers.37Table of ContentsWe account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes. The revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer. Our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. A product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The transaction consideration, including any sales incentives, is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct product or service. Management considers a variety of factors to determine the SSP, such as historical stand-alone sales of products and services, discounting strategies and other observable data. From time to time, our contracts are modified to account for additional, or to change existing, performance obligations. Our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively.Product RevenueWe recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. We use judgment to evaluate whether control has transferred by considering several indicators, including whether:•We have a present right to payment;•The customer has legal title;•The customer has physical possession;•The customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership; and•The customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the customer has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory).Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer. In circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance, the fair value of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install the product is deferred and recognized as revenue at a point in time, once installation is complete.We enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers. We adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives. These credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreed-upon incentive rate. The estimate is updated at each reporting period.We offer perpetual and term licenses for software products. The primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software, while the functionality and the features of the software are the same. Software is generally bundled with post-contract customer support (“PCS”), which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. Revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time, when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from PCS is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Services RevenueThe majority of product sales include a standard six to 12-month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers. The customers may also purchase extended warranties for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale. We have concluded that the standard 12-month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations for most of our products. The estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us.Additionally, we offer product maintenance and support services, which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale. Revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed. We also sell spare parts, revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer.38Table of ContentsSignificant JudgmentsOur contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation. Determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements. We typically estimate the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we use information such as the size of the customer, geographic region, as well as customization of the products in determining the SSP. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors, including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. While changes in the allocation of SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Although the products are generally not sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement. These credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available.As outlined above, we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and consider several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer. Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer.Contract Assets/LiabilitiesThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment. Contract assets primarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional.A contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance. The contract liabilities represent (1) deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which control has not been transferred to the customers, and (2) deferred service revenue, which is recorded when we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services, and maintenance and other service contracts.Contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, including assumptions associated with the technology migration curve, estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets, and discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital (“WACC”) analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.39Table of ContentsWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.The fair value of IPR&D is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the IPR&D assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of IPR&D is recorded to R&D expenses. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Allowance for Credit Losses. A majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor and electronics manufacturers throughout the world. We maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable and assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. However, volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans. Compensation expense for RSUs with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, or when a grant contains a market condition, the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the award’s expected life, the price volatility of the underlying stock, as well as the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date of each award.Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 15 “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets - Impairment Assessments. We review goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Pursuant to the authoritative guidance, we make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and allocate shared assets and liabilities to those reporting units, which determines the carrying values for each reporting unit. When assessing goodwill for impairment, an initial assessment of qualitative factors determines whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Judgments related to qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, relevant entity-specific events, a sustained decrease in share price and other events affecting the reporting units. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a 40Table of Contentsquantitative test is then performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill. If the former is lower, goodwill is written down by the excess amount, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. See Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the market approach when deemed appropriate and the necessary information is available, or the income approach which uses discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. Discount rates are based on a WACC, which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. The WACC used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts. The market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies.We review purchased finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are shorter than initially expected. We determine whether finite-lived intangible assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest-level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived assets’ carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. The qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets.Any impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and net asset value in the quarter in which we recognize the impairment charge. See Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in 41Table of Contentstax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activities. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.We record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for U.S. operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings.Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income. The Tax Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) wherein U.S. taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. This income is effectively taxed at a 10.5% tax rate in general. We elect to account for GILTI as a component of current period tax expense and not recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of GILTI provisions.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those recently adopted and the expected dates of adoption as well as estimated effects, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements of those not yet adopted, see Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenues and Gross Margin Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202220212020FY22 vs. FY21FY21 vs. FY20Revenues:Product$7,301,428 $5,240,316 $4,328,725 $2,061,112 39 %$911,591 21 %Service1,910,455 1,678,418 1,477,699 232,037 14 %200,719 14 %Total revenues$9,211,883 $6,918,734 $5,806,424 $2,293,149 33 %$1,112,310 19 %Costs of revenues$3,592,441 $2,772,165 $2,449,561 $820,276 30 %$322,604 13 %Gross margin61%60%58%1%2%Product revenuesOur business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period. Revenue is also impacted by average customer pricing, customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.The increase in product revenues by 39% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to strong demand for many of our products, especially our inspection, metrology and specialty semiconductor process portfolios as customers prioritize technology development investments and also expand their capacity to meet resilient semiconductor end customer demand.Service revenuesService revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in service revenues by 14% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to an increase in our installed base.42Table of ContentsRevenues by segment(1) Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202220212020FY22 vs. FY21FY21 vs. FY20Revenues:Semiconductor Process Control$7,924,822 $5,734,825 $4,745,446 $2,189,997 38 %$989,379 21 %Specialty Semiconductor Process456,579 369,216 329,700 87,363 24 %39,516 12 %PCB, Display and Component Inspection832,176 812,620 727,451 19,556 2 %85,169 12 %Other— 739 3,614 (739)(100)%(2,875)(80)%Total revenues$9,213,577 $6,917,400 $5,806,211 $2,296,177 33 %$1,111,189 19 %__________(1)Segment revenues exclude corporate allocations and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Revenue from our Semiconductor Process Control segment increased by 38% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to a strong demand for many of our products, especially from our inspection and metrology portfolios. The increase in revenues from our Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which comprises etching and deposition solutions for advanced packaging and specialty semiconductor markets, is primarily driven by advances in the IC packaging technology roadmap and growth in demand for automotive power, RF filters and MEMS devices. The revenue from our PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment was relatively flat in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021.Revenues - Top CustomersThe following customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues primarily in our Semiconductor Process Control segment for the indicated periods:Year Ended June 30,202220212020Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Revenues by regionRevenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows: Year Ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)202220212020China$2,660,438 29 %$1,831,446 26 %$1,495,977 26 %Taiwan2,528,482 27 %1,690,558 25 %1,598,201 27 %Korea1,430,495 16 %1,343,473 19 %911,848 16 %North America928,043 10 %765,974 11 %651,328 11 %Japan724,773 8 %639,381 9 %660,772 11 %Europe and Israel636,664 7 %396,422 6 %322,085 6 %Rest of Asia302,988 3 %251,480 4 %166,213 3 %Total$9,211,883 100 %$6,918,734 100 %$5,806,424 100 %A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue.43Table of ContentsGross marginOur gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products, including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions. The following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin: Gross MarginFiscal Year Ended June 30, 202057.9 %Revenue volume of products and services1.3 %Mix of products and services sold1.2 %Other service and manufacturing costs(0.5)%Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 202159.9 %Revenue volume of products and services2.3 %Mix of products and services sold0.4 %Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies(0.1)%Other service and manufacturing costs(1.5)%Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 202261.0 %Changes in gross margin, which are driven by the revenue volume of products and services, reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. Changes in gross margin from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings, and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments from business combinations. Changes in gross margin from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements, and amortization of intangible assets. Changes in gross margin from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.The increase in our gross margin from 59.9% to 61.0% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 is primarily attributable to a higher revenue volume of products and services sold and a more profitable mix of products and services sold, partially offset by an increase in service and manufacturing costs.Segment gross profit(1) Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202220212020FY22 vs. FY21FY21 vs. FY20Segment gross profit:Semiconductor Process Control$5,167,679 $3,705,222 $3,028,167 $1,462,457 39 %$677,055 22 %Specialty Semiconductor Process242,520 206,706 183,641 35,814 17 %23,065 13 %PCB, Display and Component Inspection378,964 390,571 315,723 (11,607)(3)%74,848 24 %Other— (68)(63)68 100 %(5)(8)%$5,789,163 $4,302,431 $3,527,468 $1,486,732 35 %$774,963 22 %_________________ (1) Segment gross profit is calculated as segment revenues less segment costs of revenues and excludes corporate allocations, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments, and acquisition-related costs.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units, we recorded $144.2 million and $112.5 million in impairment charges in the Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB and Display reporting units, respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2020. Restructuring ChargesOver the last few years, management approved plans to streamline our organization and business processes, which included reductions of workforce.Restructuring charges were $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. Restructuring charges were $12.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 and included $3.9 million of non-cash charges for accelerated depreciation related to certain right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and fixed assets to be abandoned.

The increase in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to a fair value loss of $18.9 million from an equity security in the current fiscal year following initial fair value gains of $26.7 million when it became marketable in the prior fiscal year, as well as a $4.4 million gain recorded in the prior fiscal year due to the sale of our interest in PixCell Medical Technologies Ltd. These were partially offset by a gain from the sale of an investment of $27.7 million in fiscal year 2022.Loss on Extinguishment of DebtFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, loss on extinguishment of debt reflected a pre-tax net loss of $22.5 million associated with the redemption of our $500.0 million of Senior Notes due 2021, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes:Year Ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)202220212020Income before income taxes$3,489,237 $2,360,454 $1,316,711 Provision for income taxes$167,177 $283,101 $101,686 Effective tax rate4.8 %12.0 %7.7 %Tax expense was lower as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to the impact of the following items:•Tax expense decreased by $392.7 million relating to a non-recurring tax benefit resulting from the intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022; •Tax expense decreased by $29.3 million relating to the impact of an increase in the proportion of KLA's earnings generated in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022; partially offset by•Tax expense increased by $93.4 million relating to an increase in our unrecognized tax benefit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022; and•Tax expense increased by $21.2 million relating to a non-deductible decrease in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan (“EDSP”) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, R&D credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, non-taxable or non-deductible increases 46Table of Contentsor decreases in the assets held within our EDSP, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.For discussions on tax examinations, assessments and certain related proceedings, see Note 14 “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)202220212020Cash and cash equivalents$1,584,908 $1,434,610 $1,234,409 Marketable securities1,123,100 1,059,912 746,063 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,708,008 $2,494,522 $1,980,472 Percentage of total assets21 %24 %21 % Year Ended June 30,(In thousands)202220212020Cash flows:Net cash provided by operating activities$3,312,702 $2,185,026 $1,778,850 Net cash used in investing activities(876,458)(500,404)(258,874)Net cash used in financing activities(2,257,005)(1,497,881)(1,299,635)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(28,941)13,460 (1,926)Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$150,298 $200,201 $218,415 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:As of June 30, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.71 billion, which represents an increase of $213.5 million from June 30, 2021. The increase is mainly due to net cash provided by operating activities of $3.31 billion and net proceeds from issuance of debt, including net draws on our Prior Revolving Credit Facility and our Revolving Credit Facility, of $3.22 billion, partially offset by stock repurchases of $3.97 billion, cash paid for purchase of forward contract for accelerated share repurchases of $900.0 million, cash used for payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $638.5 million, cash paid for business acquisitions of $479.1 million, capital expenditures of $307.3 million and net cash usage of $118.5 million related to the purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale and trading securities.As of June 30, 2022, $1.29 billion of our $2.71 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $77.1 million of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 1%-22% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of $1.21 billion of the $1.29 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense.Cash Dividends:The total amounts of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $638.5 million, $559.4 million and $522.4 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.90 to $1.05 per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2021. The amounts of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested RSUs with dividend equivalent rights were $11.2 million and $10.3 million as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The settlement of the accrued dividend equivalents will occur upon vesting of the underlying unvested RSUs as described in Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 4, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.30 per share. Refer to Note 21 “Subsequent Events” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to June 30, 2022.47Table of ContentsStock Repurchases:The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Our stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to mitigate the potential dilutive impact related to our equity incentive plans and shares issued in connection with our ESPP as well as to return excess cash to our stockholders. As of March 31, 2022 an aggregate of $0.70 billion was available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. In June 2022, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $6.00 billion for share repurchases. On June 23, 2022, the Company executed ASR Agreements with two financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock in exchange for an upfront payment of $3.00 billion. The Company received initial deliveries totaling approximately 6.5 million shares on June 24, 2022, which represented 70% of the prepayment amount at the then prevailing market price of the Company's shares of stock. The initial shares delivered were retired immediately upon settlement and treated as repurchases of the Company's common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. The value of the shares yet to be delivered to the Company for the remainder of the upfront payment of approximately $0.90 billion was recorded as an unsettled forward contract, classified within stockholders’ equity. The delivery of any remaining shares would occur at the final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreements, which is scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, subject to earlier termination under certain limited circumstances, as set forth in the ASR Agreements. The total number of shares received under the ASR Agreements will be based on the volume-weighted average prices of the Company's stock during the term of the ASR Agreements, less an agreed-upon discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreements. Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities:We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 increased by $1.13 billion compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, from $2.19 billion to $3.31 billion, primarily as a result of the following factors:•An increase in collections of approximately $2.6 billion mainly driven by higher shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021; and•An increase in gains from currency and interest rate derivatives used for risk management purposes of approximately $99 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021; partially offset by the following items:•An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $1.1 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021;•An increase in employee-related payments of approximately $292 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021; and •An increase in income tax payments of approximately $128 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.Cash Flows Used in Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 was $876.5 million compared to $500.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. This increase in cash used was mainly due to an increase in cash paid for business acquisitions of $479.1 million and an increase in cash paid to purchase fixed assets of $75.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of available for sale and trading securities of $169.6 million. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 was $2.26 billion compared to $1.50 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. This increase was mainly due to an increase in cash used for stock repurchases of $3.03 billion, cash paid for purchase of forward contract for accelerated share repurchases of $900.0 million and an increase cash paid for dividends and dividend equivalents of $79.2 million, partially offset by an increase in net debt proceeds of $3.25 billion.Senior Notes:In June 2022, we issued $3.00 billion (“2022 Senior Notes”) aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes as follows: $1.00 billion of 4.650% senior, unsecured notes due July 15, 2032; $1.20 billion of 4.950% senior, unsecured notes due July 15, 2052; and $800.0 million of 5.250% senior, unsecured notes due July 15, 2062. A portion of the net proceeds of the 2022 Senior Notes are intended to be used to purchase up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million of our 2014 Senior Notes due 2024; refer to Note 21 “Subsequent Events” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more 48Table of Contentsinformation on the purchase of a portion of our Senior Notes due 2024. The remainder of the net proceeds were used for share repurchases and for general corporate purposes.In February 2020, March 2019 and November 2014, we issued $750.0 million, $1.20 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively (the “2020 Senior Notes,” “2019 Senior Notes” and “2014 Senior Notes,” respectively, and collectively with the 2022 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”), aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured notes. In February 2020, October 2019 and November 2017, we repaid $500.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of the Senior Notes, respectively.In February 2020, S&P upgraded its credit rating of the Company to “BBB+” and revised its outlook to stable, which permanently eliminated interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 Senior Notes became fixed. The interest rates for each series of the 2020 Senior Notes and 2019 Senior Notes are not subject to credit-rating-based rate adjustments.Since fiscal 2015, we have entered into four sets of forward contracts to lock the benchmark interest rate on portions of our Senior Notes prior to issuance (“Rate Lock Agreements”). Upon issuance of the associated debt, the Rate Lock Agreements were settled and their fair values were recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The resulting gains and losses from these transactions are amortized to interest expense over the lives of the associated debt. For additional details on the forward contracts, refer to Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.The original discounts on the 2022 Senior Notes, the 2020 Senior Notes, the 2019 Senior Notes and the 2014 Senior Notes amounted to $12.8 million, $0.3 million, $6.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and are being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable as follows: semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year for the 2022 Senior Notes; semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year for the 2020 Senior Notes; semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year for the 2019 Senior Notes; and semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year for the 2014 Senior Notes. The relevant indentures for the Senior Notes (collectively, the “Indenture”) include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions.In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of Senior Notes by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, unless we have exercised our rights to redeem the Senior Notes of such series, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part, of each holder’s Senior Notes of that series pursuant to the Change of Control Offer. In the Change of Control Offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase.As of June 30, 2022, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.Revolving Credit Facility:As of March 31, 2022, we had in place the Prior Credit Agreement providing for a $1.00 billion five-year unsecured Prior Revolving Credit Facility with a maturity date of November 30, 2023. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we replaced the Prior Credit Agreement and Prior Revolving Credit Facility with the Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility having a maturity of June 8, 2027 that allows us to borrow up to $1.50 billion. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. As of June 30, 2021, we had no aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Prior Revolving Credit Facility. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we borrowed $600.0 million from the Prior Revolving Credit Facility and made principal payments of $600.0 million. As of June 30, 2022, we had an aggregate principal amount of $275.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was borrowed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.We may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility until the maturity date, at which time we may exercise two one-year extension options with the consent of the lenders. We may prepay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty.49Table of ContentsBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility can be made as Term Secured Overnight Financing (“SOFR”) Loans or Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”) Loans, at the Company's option. In the event that Term SOFR is unavailable, any Term SOFR elections will be converted to Daily Simple SOFR, as long as it is available. Each Term SOFR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Adjusted Term SOFR rate, which is equal to the applicable Term SOFR rate plus 10 bps that shall not be less than zero, plus a spread ranging from 75 bps to 125 bps, as determined by the Company’s credit ratings at the time. Each ABR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus a spread ranging from 0 bps to 25 bps, as determined by the Company’s credit ratings at the time. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 4.5 bps to 12.5 bps, subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating. The applicable interest rates and commitment fees are also subject to adjustment based on the Company’s performance against certain environmental sustainability KPI related to GHG emissions and renewable electricity usage. As of June 30, 2022, the all-in interest rate of the $275.0 million outstanding Term SOFR loans reflected the applicable adjusted Term SOFR plus a spread of 100 bps and the applicable commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was 9 bps.The Prior Revolving Credit Facility required us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the Prior Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. The Revolving Credit Facility removed that requirement. The maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, is 3.50 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions. As of June 30, 2022, our maximum allowed leverage ratio was 3.50 to 1.00.We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2022 (the leverage ratio was 1.61 to 1.00). Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.Factoring ArrangementsWe have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LC”), without recourse, received from customers as payment for goods and services.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LC for the indicated periods:Year Ended June 30,(In thousands)202220212020Receivables sold under factoring agreements$250,983 $305,565 $293,006 Proceeds from sales of LC$151,924 $133,679 $59,036 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $92.1 million, of which $59.6 million had been issued as of June 30, 2022, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe, Israel, and Asia.50Table of ContentsMaterial Cash RequirementsThe following is a schedule summarizing our future material cash requirements as of June 30, 2022: (In thousands)TotalShort-TermLong-termDebt obligations(1)$6,450,000 $— $6,450,000 Interest payments associated with all debt obligations(2)5,755,757 234,968 5,520,789 Purchase commitments(3)3,751,523 3,284,455 467,068 Income taxes payable(4)223,186 — 223,186 Operating leases(5)120,704 34,305 86,399 Cash long-term incentive program(6)198,806 81,411 117,395 Pension obligations(7)49,675 3,994 45,681 EDSP(8)225,867 — 225,867 Transition tax payable(9)221,856 26,143 195,713 Liability for employee rights upon retirement(10)49,240 — 49,240 Other(11)11,197 5,687 5,510 Total material cash requirements$17,057,811 $3,670,963 $13,386,848 ______________(1)Represents $6.45 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2063.(2)The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes payable included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable interest rate for each series of Senior Notes. As of June 30, 2022, the interest payment under the Revolving Credit Facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 9 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance, and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. Our future interest payments for the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to change due to any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating as well as the Company’s performance against certain environmental sustainability KPIs related to GHG emissions and renewable electricity usage.(3)Represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with goods, services and other assets in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.(4)Represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.(5)Operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases, but exclude non-lease components.(6)As part of our employee compensation program, we issue cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards to many of our employees. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in three or four equal installments. The amounts in the table above are those committed under the Cash LTI Plan; the expected total payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately $166 million. For additional details, refer to Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.(7)Represents an estimate of expected benefit payments up to fiscal year 2032 that was actuarially determined and excludes the minimum cash required to contribute to our defined benefit pension plans. As of June 30, 2022, our defined benefit pension plans do not have material required minimum cash contribution obligations.(8)Represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant’s separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections.(9)Represents the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act into law on December 22, 2017.51Table of Contents(10)Represents severance payments due upon dismissal of an employee or upon termination of employment in certain other circumstances as required under Israeli law.(11)Represents amounts committed for accrued dividends payable for quarterly cash dividends for unvested RSUs granted with dividend equivalent rights.

As of June 30, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.71 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions, and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $1.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2022 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRatingFitchA-Moody’sA2S&PA-In June 2022, S&P upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB+ to A-. In March 2022, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB+ to A-. In June 2021, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from Baa1 to A2. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries, our financial position, material acquisitions and changes in our business strategy.52Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2022. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2022, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.01 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2022, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $9.4 million.The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as market interest rates fall and decrease as market interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2022, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes due in various fiscal years ranging from 2025 to 2063 were $6.39 billion and $6.45 billion, respectively. Since February 2020, the interest rates on our Senior Notes have not been subject to credit-rating based rate adjustments.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we replaced the Prior Credit Agreement and Prior Revolving Credit Facility with a renegotiated Credit Agreement and renegotiated unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. Subject to the terms of Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility allows us to borrow up to $1.50 billion, has a maturity date of June 8, 2027 with two one-year extension options, and may be increased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. As of June 30, 2022, we had an aggregate principal amount of $275.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Each Term SOFR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Adjusted Term SOFR rate, which is equal to the applicable Term SOFR rate plus 10 bps that shall not be less than zero, plus a spread ranging from 75 bps to 125 bps, as determined by the Company's credit ratings at the time. The fair value of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to interest rate and credit risk due to the timing of the rate resets and changes in the market's assessment of risk of default, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate that ranges from 4.5 bps to 12.5 bps, depending upon the Company's then prevailing credit rating. As of June 30, 2022 the annual commitment fee was 9 bps. At June 30, 2022, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $1 million. Our equity investment in a publicly traded company is subject to market price risk, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities. As of June 30, 2022, the fair value of our investment in the marketable equity security, which began publicly trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on April 5, 2021, was $11.0 million. Assuming a decline of 50% in market prices, the aggregate value of our investment in the marketable equity security could decrease by approximately $6 million, based on the value as of June 30, 2022.See Note 5 “Marketable Securities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2022.As of June 30, 2022, we had net forward and option contracts to purchase $58.2 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2022, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $64.2 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $94.2 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.53Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:29.945792
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2023,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, 35Table of Contentsincluding but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (see “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”). Discussions and analysis of fiscal year 2022 as compared against fiscal year 2021 have been omitted and can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, filed with the SEC.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYWe are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor and related electronics industries. Our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, support R&D and manufacturing of ICs, wafers and reticles. Our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects, helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges and to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost. We also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of PCBs, FPDs, specialty semiconductor devices and other electronic components, including advanced packaging, LED, power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor device manufacturing markets: memory and foundry/logic. The pervasive and increasing needs for semiconductors in many consumer and industrial products, the rapid proliferation of new applications for more advanced semiconductor devices, and the increasing complexity associated with leading edge semiconductor manufacturing drives demand for our process control and yield management solutions. Continuing advancement of technology spurred by the economic, power and performance benefits of being at the leading edge, increasing involvement in legacy nodes as semiconductor content increases, and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies are fueling long-term growth for the semiconductor equipment industry. End-market demand drivers that are expected to continue in the long term are related to AI, the deployment of 5G telecommunications technology and associated high-end mobile devices, the electrification and digitization of the automotive industry, the revival of personal computer demand and associated innovations to support remote work, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment, and the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”). As we get further into 2023, the macro-driven slowdown continues to have an impact on semiconductor device demand as the semiconductor industry rebalances its supply chain and inventory levels. As a result, memory device manufacturers and foundry/logic customers are reducing their capacity expansion-focused capital expenditure plans for calendar 2023. While we continue to invest in technological innovation, we are focusing on moderating our spending levels to reflect the changing environment. Push out or cancellation of deliveries to our customers could cause earnings volatility, due to the timing of revenue recognition as well as increased risk of inventory-related charges.We are organized into three reportable segments. Prior to July 1, 2022, we had a fourth segment, Other, but core assets from that segment were sold, making it non-operational and the segment was eliminated. The remaining three segments are as follows:•Semiconductor Process Control: a comprehensive portfolio of inspection, metrology and data analytics products as well as related service offerings that help IC manufacturers achieve target yields throughout the semiconductor fabrication process, from R&D to final volume production.•Specialty Semiconductor Process: advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers.•PCB, Display and Component Inspection: a range of inspection, testing and measurement, and direct imaging for patterning products used by manufacturers of PCBs, FPDs, advanced packaging, MEMS and other electronic components.A majority of our revenues are derived from outside the U.S., and include geographic regions such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Europe and Israel, and Rest of Asia. China is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world’s largest consumer of ICs. Additionally, a significant portion of global FPD and PCB manufacturing has migrated to China. Chinese government initiatives are propelling China to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting investment from semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the U.S. Although China is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector, Commerce has adopted regulations and added certain China-based entities to the U.S. Entity List, restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without a license. In addition, Commerce has imposed export licensing requirements on China-based customers that are military end users or engaged in military end uses, as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on U.S. technology to manufacture products connected to certain entities on the U.S. Entity List. In addition, in October 2022, the BIS Rules imposed export licensing requirements for certain U.S. semiconductor and high-performance computing technology (including wafer fab equipment), for the use of such technology for certain end uses in 36Table of ContentsChina, and for the provision of support by U.S. Persons to certain advanced IC fabs located in China. In particular, the BIS Rules impose export license requirements effectively on all KLA products and services to customers located in China that fabricate:a. Non-planar ICs (e.g., FinFet or GaaFeT) or 14/16nm and below logic ICs;b. NAND ICs at 128 layers and above; andc. DRAM ICs using a “production” technology node of 18 nanometer half-pitch or less.KLA is also restricted from providing certain U.S. origin tools, software and technology to certain wafer fab equipment manufacturers and maskshops located in China, absent an export license. We are taking appropriate measures to comply with such regulations and are applying for export licenses, when required, to avoid disruption to our customers’ operations. While some export licenses have been obtained by us or our customers, there can be no assurance that export licenses applied for by either us or our customers will be granted.The BIS Rules are complex, and while they have not significantly impacted our operations to date, the possible negative effects on our future business of export licenses not being granted could be material and could result in a substantial reduction to our RPO or require us to return substantial deposits received from customers in China for purchase orders. We are continuously assessing the aggregate potential impact of the existing regulations and BIS Rules on our financial results and operations. There is a likelihood of system reallocation of products to other customers where supply is meaningfully below demand for those products. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this report for more information regarding how such actions by the U.S. government or another country could significantly impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers, especially in China, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year Ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands, except diluted net income per share)202320222021Total revenues$10,496,056 $9,211,883 $6,918,734 Costs of revenues$4,218,307 $3,592,441 $2,772,165 Gross margin60 %61 %60 %Net income attributable to KLA$3,387,277 $3,321,807 $2,078,292 Diluted net income per share attributable to KLA$24.15 $21.92 $13.37 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:Revenue Recognition. We primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and process-enabling solutions for the semiconductor and related electronics industries, maintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services, and the sale of spare parts. Our portfolio includes yield enhancement and production solutions for manufacturing wafers and reticles, ICs, packaging, PCBs and FPDs, as well as comprehensive support and services across our installed base. Our solutions are generally not sold with a right of return, nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers.We account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes. The revenues are recognized as separate 37Table of Contentsperformance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer. Our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. A product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The transaction consideration, including any sales incentives, is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct product or service. Management considers a variety of factors to determine the SSP, such as historical stand-alone sales of products and services, discounting strategies and other observable data. From time to time, our contracts are modified to account for additional, or to change existing, performance obligations. Our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively.Product RevenueWe recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customer. We use judgment to evaluate whether control has transferred by considering several indicators, including whether:•We have a present right to payment;•The customer has legal title;•The customer has physical possession;•The customer has significant risk and rewards of ownership; and•The customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the customer has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory).Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer. In circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance, the fair value of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install the product is deferred and recognized as revenue at a point in time, once installation is complete.We enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers. We adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives. These credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreed-upon incentive rate. The estimate is reviewed for material changes and updated at each reporting period.We offer perpetual and term licenses for software products. The primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software, while the functionality and the features of the software are the same. Software is generally bundled with post-contract customer support (“PCS”), which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. Revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time, when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from PCS is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Services RevenueThe majority of product sales includes a standard six to 12-month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers. The customers may also purchase extended warranties for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale. We have concluded that the standard 12-month warranty, as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales, are separate performance obligations for most of our products. The estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us.Additionally, we offer product maintenance and support services, which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale. Revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period. Revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed. We also sell spare parts, revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer.38Table of ContentsSignificant JudgmentsOur contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. Each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation. Determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements. We typically estimate the SSP of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we use information such as the size of the customer, geographic region, as well as customization of the products in determining the SSP. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors, including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. While changes in the allocation of SSP between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Although our products are generally not sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement. These credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available.As outlined above, we use judgments to evaluate whether or not the customer has obtained control of the product and consider several indicators in evaluating whether or not control has transferred to the customer. Not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer.Contract Assets/LiabilitiesThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment. Contract assets primarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional.A contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance. The contract liabilities represent (1) deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which control has not been transferred to the customers, and (2) deferred service revenue, which is recorded when we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services, and maintenance and other service contracts.Contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Business Combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, including assumptions associated with the technology migration curve, estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology-related intangible assets, and discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital (“WACC”) analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.39Table of ContentsWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. After the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.The fair value of IPR&D is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the IPR&D assets may not be recoverable. Impairment of IPR&D is recorded to R&D expenses. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.Inventory Valuation. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The carrying value of product inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand for meeting our product manufacturing plans. The carrying value of service inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand to meet our customers’ support requirements. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. The Company’s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. The estimate of net realizable value of inventory is impacted by assumptions regarding general semiconductor market conditions, manufacturing schedules, technology changes, new product introductions and possible alternative uses, and require us to use significant judgment that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. Allowance for Credit Losses. A majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor and electronics manufacturers throughout the world. We maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable and assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. However, volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Plans. Compensation expense for RSUs with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, or when a grant contains a market condition, the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the award’s expected life, the price volatility of the underlying stock, as well as the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date of each award.Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Note 15 “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” and Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets - Impairment Assessments. We review goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Pursuant to the authoritative guidance, we make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and allocate shared assets and liabilities to those reporting units, which determines the carrying values for each reporting unit. When assessing goodwill for impairment, an initial assessment of qualitative factors determines whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 40Table of ContentsJudgments related to qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, relevant entity-specific events, a sustained decrease in share price and other events affecting the reporting units. If we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill. If the former is lower, goodwill is written down by the excess amount, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. See Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the market approach when deemed appropriate and the necessary information is available, or the income approach which uses discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis, or a combination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. Discount rates are based on a WACC, which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. The WACC used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts. The market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies.We review purchased finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are shorter than initially expected. We determine whether finite-lived intangible assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest-level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived assets’ carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.We review purchased indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing purchased indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the purchased indefinite-lived intangible asset. The qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the purchased indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any purchased indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. Our purchased indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets.Any impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and net asset value in the quarter in which we recognize the impairment charge. See Note 7 “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the 41Table of Contentsweight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activities. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.We record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for U.S. operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings.Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income. The Tax Act includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) wherein U.S. taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. This income is effectively taxed at a 10.5% tax rate in general. We elect to account for GILTI as a component of current period tax expense and not recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of GILTI provisions.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those recently adopted and the expected dates of adoption as well as estimated effects, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements of those not yet adopted, see Note 1 “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenues and Gross Margin Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202320222021FY23 vs. FY22FY22 vs. FY21Revenues:Product$8,379,025 $7,301,428 $5,240,316 $1,077,597 15 %$2,061,112 39 %Service2,117,031 1,910,455 1,678,418 206,576 11 %232,037 14 %Total revenues$10,496,056 $9,211,883 $6,918,734 $1,284,173 14 %$2,293,149 33 %Costs of revenues$4,218,307 $3,592,441 $2,772,165 $625,866 17 %$820,276 30 %Gross margin60%61%60%(1)%1%Product revenuesOur business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers’ capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. Our product revenues in any particular period are impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding periods. Revenue is also impacted by average customer pricing, customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and increased trade restrictions as discussed in the “Executive Summary” section above.The increase in product revenues by 15% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to strong demand for many of our products, especially our inspection and metrology portfolios, as well as increases from continued growth in the specialty semiconductor markets and is partially offset by market softening in the display markets.Service revenuesService revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers. The amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in service revenues by 11% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily attributable to an increase in our installed base.42Table of ContentsRevenues by segment(1)(2) Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202320222021FY23 vs. FY22FY22 vs. FY21Revenues:Semiconductor Process Control$9,324,190 $7,924,822 $5,734,825 $1,399,368 18 %$2,189,997 38 %Specialty Semiconductor Process543,398 456,579 369,216 86,819 19 %87,363 24 %PCB, Display and Component Inspection631,604 832,176 812,620 (200,572)(24)%19,556 2 %Total segment revenues$10,499,192 $9,213,577 $6,916,661 $1,285,615 14 %$2,296,916 33 %__________(1)Segment revenues exclude corporate allocations and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Changes in gross margin from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements and amortization of intangible assets. Changes in gross margin from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.The decrease in our gross margin from 61.0% to 59.8% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to an increase in service and manufacturing costs, partially offset by a higher revenue volume of products and services sold.44Table of ContentsSegment gross profit(1)(2) Year Ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)202320222021FY23 vs. FY22FY22 vs. FY21Segment gross profit:Semiconductor Process Control$5,957,573 $5,167,679 $3,705,222 $789,894 15 %$1,462,457 39 %Specialty Semiconductor Process281,942 242,520 206,706 39,422 16 %35,814 17 %PCB, Display and Component Inspection221,251 378,964 390,571 (157,713)(42)%(11,607)(3)%Total segment gross profit$6,460,766 $5,789,163 $4,302,499 $671,603 12 %$1,486,664 35 %_________________ (1) Segment gross profit is calculated as segment revenues less segment costs of revenues and excludes corporate allocations, amortization of intangible assets and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The change in Other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to the following: higher interest income of $64.8 million due to higher rates, a pre-tax gain of $29.7 million from the sale of our interest in Orbograph to a portfolio company of a private equity firm in fiscal year 2023, a higher net fair value gain of $26.0 million from an equity security compared to the prior fiscal year, decreases in accruals related to uncertain tax positions of $13.3 million and is partially offset by a gain from the sale of an investment of $27.7 million in fiscal year 2022.Loss on Extinguishment of DebtFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, loss on extinguishment of debt reflected a pre-tax net loss of $13.3 million associated with the redemption of $500.0 million of our Senior Notes due 2024, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses.Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes:46Table of ContentsYear Ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)202320222021Income before income taxes$3,789,190 $3,489,237 $2,360,454 Provision for income taxes$401,839 $167,177 $283,101 Effective tax rate10.6 %4.8 %12.0 %Tax expense was higher as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to the impact of the following items that occurred during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022:•Tax expense decreased by $392.7 million relating to a non-recurring tax benefit resulting from the intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights; partially offset by•Tax expense increased by $163.7 million relating to a non-recurring tax expense resulting from a new Israel tax law enacted on November 15, 2021. The new Israel tax limits our ability to maintain our previous representation that the historical earnings were permanently reinvested in Israel.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, R&D credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our EDSP, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.For discussions on tax examinations, assessments and certain related proceedings, see Note 14 “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)202320222021Cash and cash equivalents$1,927,865 $1,584,908 $1,434,610 Marketable securities1,315,294 1,123,100 1,059,912 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$3,243,159 $2,708,008 $2,494,522 Percentage of total assets23 %21 %24 % Year Ended June 30,(In thousands)202320222021Cash flows:Net cash provided by operating activities$3,669,805 $3,312,702 $2,185,026 Net cash used in investing activities(482,571)(876,458)(500,404)Net cash used in financing activities(2,830,289)(2,257,005)(1,497,881)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(13,988)(28,941)13,460 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$342,957 $150,298 $200,201 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:As of June 30, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.24 billion, which represents an increase of $535.2 million from June 30, 2022. The increase is mainly due to net cash provided by operating activities of $3.67 billion and net proceeds from the sale of a business of $75.4 million, partially offset by stock repurchases of $1.31 billion, net repayments of debt of $787.3 million, cash used for payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $732.6 million and capital expenditures of $341.6 million.As of June 30, 2023, $1.04 billion of our $3.24 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $92.5 million of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 1%-22% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and 47Table of Contentsmanner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. We have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of $951.3 million of the $1.04 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense.Cash Dividends:The total amounts of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $732.6 million, $638.5 million and $559.4 million, respectively. The increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $1.05 to $1.30 per share that was instituted during the three months ended September 30, 2022. The amounts of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested RSUs with dividend equivalent rights were $12.2 million and $11.2 million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested RSUs as described in Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 3, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.30 per share. Refer to Note 21 “Subsequent Events” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to June 30, 2023.Stock Repurchases:The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Our stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to mitigate the potential dilutive impact related to our equity incentive plans and shares issued in connection with our ESPP as well as to return excess cash to our stockholders. As of June 30, 2023, an aggregate of $1.91 billion was available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program, which reflects an increase in the authorized repurchase amount of $6.00 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. On June 23, 2022, the Company executed accelerated share repurchase agreements (the “ASR Agreements”) with two financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock in exchange for an upfront payment of $3.00 billion. The Company received initial deliveries totaling approximately 6.5 million shares on June 24, 2022, which represented 70% of the prepayment amount at the then-prevailing market price of the Company’s shares of stock. The initial shares delivered were retired immediately upon settlement and treated as repurchases of the Company’s common stock for purposes of earnings per share calculations. Final settlement of the ASR Agreements occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2022, resulting in the delivery of 2.4 million additional shares, which yielded an average share price of $333.88 for the entire transaction.The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) introduced a 1% excise tax imposed on certain stock repurchases by publicly traded companies made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is recorded as part of the cost basis of treasury stock repurchased after December 31, 2022 and, as such, is included in stockholders’ equity.Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities:We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 increased by $357.1 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, from $3.31 billion to $3.67 billion, primarily as a result of the following factors:•An increase in collections of approximately $1.6 billion mainly driven by higher shipments; and•An increase in interest income of approximately $65 million; partially offset by•A decrease due to prior year gains from currency and interest rate derivatives used for risk management purposes of approximately $111 million; •An increase in accounts payable payments of approximately $848 million;•An increase in employee-related payments of approximately $266 million; •An increase in income tax payments of approximately $31 million; •An increase in other tax payments of approximately $27 million; and•An increase in debt interest payment of approximately $67 million 48Table of ContentsCash Flows Used in Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 was $482.6 million compared to $876.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. This decrease in cash used was mainly due to a decrease in cash paid for business acquisitions of $452.0 million and an increase in proceeds from the sale of a business of $75.4 million, partially offset by an increase in net purchases of available for sale and trading securities of $71.7 million and an increase in cash paid to purchase fixed assets of $34.3 million. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities:Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 was $2.83 billion compared to $2.26 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. This increase was mainly due to an increase in net debt repayments of $4.02 billion, an increase in cash paid for dividends and dividend equivalents of $93.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash used for stock repurchases of $2.66 billion and cash paid for purchase of forward contract for accelerated share repurchases of $900.0 million.Senior Notes:In June 2022, we issued $3.00 billion (“2022 Senior Notes”) aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes as follows: $1.00 billion of 4.650% senior, unsecured notes due July 15, 2032; $1.20 billion of 4.950% senior, unsecured notes due July 15, 2052; and $800.0 million of 5.250% senior, unsecured notes due July 15, 2062. A portion of the net proceeds of the 2022 Senior Notes was used to complete a tender offer in July 2022 for an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million of our 2014 Senior Notes due 2024, as defined below. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax net loss on extinguishment of debt of $13.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The remainder of the net proceeds were used for share repurchases and for general corporate purposes.In February 2020, March 2019 and November 2014, we issued $750.0 million, $1.20 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively (the “2020 Senior Notes,” “2019 Senior Notes” and “2014 Senior Notes,” respectively, and collectively with the 2022 Senior Notes, the “Senior Notes”), aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured notes. In July 2022, February 2020, October 2019 and November 2017, we repaid $500.0 million, $500.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of the Senior Notes, respectively.The original discounts on the Senior Notes are being amortized over the life of the debt. Interest is payable as follows: semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year for the 2022 Senior Notes; semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year for the 2020 Senior Notes; semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year for the 2019 Senior Notes; and semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year for the 2014 Senior Notes. The relevant indentures for the Senior Notes (collectively, the “Indenture”) include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions.In certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of Senior Notes by at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, unless we have exercised our rights to redeem the Senior Notes of such series, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder’s option, any part of each holder’s Senior Notes of that series pursuant to the Change of Control Offer. In the Change of Control Offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase.As of June 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the Indenture associated with the Senior Notes.Revolving Credit Facility:As of March 31, 2022, we had in place the Prior Credit Agreement providing for a $1.00 billion five-year unsecured Prior Revolving Credit Facility with a maturity date of November 30, 2023. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we replaced the Prior Credit Agreement and Prior Revolving Credit Facility with the Credit Agreement and the Revolving Credit Facility having a maturity of June 8, 2027 that allows us to borrow up to $1.50 billion. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. As of June 30, 2022, we had $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was borrowed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we borrowed $300.0 million from the Revolving Credit Facility and made principal payments of $575.0 million so that, as of June 30, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.49Table of ContentsWe may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the Revolving Credit Facility until the maturity date, at which time we may exercise two one-year extension options with the consent of the lenders. We may prepay outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time without a prepayment penalty.Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility can be made as Term Secured Overnight Financing (“SOFR”) Loans or Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”) Loans, at the Company’s option. In the event that Term SOFR is unavailable, any Term SOFR elections will be converted to Daily Simple SOFR, as long as it is available. Each Term SOFR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Adjusted Term SOFR rate, which is equal to the applicable Term SOFR rate plus 10 bps that shall not be less than zero, plus a spread ranging from 75 bps to 125 bps, as determined by the Company’s credit ratings at the time. Each ABR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus a spread ranging from 0 bps to 25 bps, as determined by the Company’s credit ratings at the time. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 4.5 bps to 12.5 bps, subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating. The applicable interest rates and commitment fees are also subject to adjustment based on the Company’s performance against certain environmental sustainability key performance indicators (“KPI”) related to GHG emissions and renewable electricity usage. Our performance against these KPIs in calendar year 2022 resulted in reductions to the fees associated with our Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2023, the all-in interest rate of the Term SOFR loans reflected the applicable adjusted Term SOFR plus a spread of 97.5 bps and the applicable commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility was 8.5 bps.The Prior Revolving Credit Facility required us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio, as described in the Prior Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. The Revolving Credit Facility removed that requirement. The maximum leverage ratio as described in the Credit Agreement, on a quarterly basis, is 3.50 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions. As of June 30, 2023, our maximum allowed leverage ratio was 3.50 to 1.00.We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2023 (the leverage ratio was 1.26 to 1.00). Considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the Revolving Credit Facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.Factoring ArrangementsWe have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit (“LC”), without recourse, received from customers as payment for goods and services.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LC for the indicated periods:Year Ended June 30,(In thousands)202320222021Receivables sold under factoring agreements$328,933 $250,983 $305,565 Proceeds from sales of LC$69,247 $151,924 $133,679 Factoring and LC fees for the sale of certain trade receivables were recorded in Other expense (income), net and were not material for the periods presented.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $78.2 million, of which $44.7 million had been issued as of June 30, 2023, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe, Israel, and Asia.50Table of ContentsMaterial Cash RequirementsThe following is a schedule summarizing our future material cash requirements as of June 30, 2023: (In thousands)TotalShort-TermLong-termDebt obligations(1)$5,950,000 $— $5,950,000 Interest payments associated with all debt obligations(2)5,457,961 275,725 5,182,236 Purchase commitments(3)2,505,755 2,284,237 221,518 Income taxes payable(4)208,067 — 208,067 Operating leases(5)198,352 38,042 160,310 Cash long-term incentive program(6)175,443 76,762 98,681 Pension obligations(7)51,816 4,344 47,472 EDSP(8)258,223 — 258,223 Transition tax payable(9)195,713 49,017 146,696 Liability for employee rights upon retirement(10)46,014 — 46,014 Other(11)12,185 6,962 5,223 Total material cash requirements$15,059,529 $2,735,089 $12,324,440 ______________(1)Represents $5.95 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2063.(2)The interest payments associated with the Senior Notes payable included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable interest rate for each series of Senior Notes. As of June 30, 2023, the commitment fee payment under the Revolving Credit Facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 8.5 bps based on the daily undrawn balance, and we assumed no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility for the future and utilized the existing commitment fee rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. Our future interest payments for the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to change due to our actual borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, any upgrades or downgrades to our then-effective credit rating as well as the Company’s performance against certain environmental sustainability KPIs related to GHG emissions and renewable electricity usage.(3)Represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with goods, services and other assets in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.(4)Represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.(5)Operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases, but exclude non-lease components.(6)As part of our employee compensation program, we issue cash-based long-term incentive (“Cash LTI”) awards to many of our employees. Cash LTI awards issued to employees under the Cash Long-Term Incentive Plan (“Cash LTI Plan”) generally vest in three or four equal installments. The amounts in the table above are those committed under the Cash LTI Plan; the expected total payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately $146 million. For additional details, refer to Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.(7)Represents an estimate of expected benefit payments up to fiscal year 2033 that was actuarially determined and excludes the minimum cash required to contribute to our defined benefit pension plans. As of June 30, 2023, our defined benefit pension plans do not have material required minimum cash contribution obligations.(8)Represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant’s separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections.(9)Represents the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act into law on December 22, 2017.51Table of Contents(10)Represents severance payments due upon dismissal of an employee or upon termination of employment in certain other circumstances as required under Israeli law.(11)Represents amounts committed for accrued dividends payable for quarterly cash dividends for unvested RSUs granted with dividend equivalent rights. For additional details, refer to Note 10 “Equity, Long-term Incentive Compensation Plans and Non-Controlling Interest” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Working Capital:Working capital was $4.63 billion as of June 30, 2023, which represents an increase of $331.4 million compared to our working capital as of June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $3.24 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions, and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $1.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. Our credit ratings as of June 30, 2023 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRatingFitchA-Moody’sA2S&PA-In June 2022, S&P upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB+ to A-. In March 2022, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from BBB+ to A-. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries, our financial position, material acquisitions and changes in our business strategy.52Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2023. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2023, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.23 billion. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2023, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $12.4 million.The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate Senior Notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as market interest rates fall and decrease as market interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2023, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes due in various fiscal years ranging from 2025 to 2063 were $5.69 billion and $5.89 billion, respectively. We have in place a Revolving Credit Facility that allows us to borrow up to $1.50 billion, has a maturity date of June 8, 2027 with two one-year extension options, and may be increased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. As of June 30, 2023, we had no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Each Term SOFR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Adjusted Term SOFR rate, which is equal to the applicable Term SOFR rate plus 10 bps that shall not be less than zero, plus a spread ranging from 75 bps to 125 bps, as determined by our credit ratings at the time. The fair value of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to interest rate and credit risk due to the timing of the rate resets and changes in the market’s assessment of risk of default, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility at a rate that ranges from 4.5 bps to 12.5 bps, depending upon our then prevailing credit rating. As of June 30, 2023 the annual commitment fee was 8.5 bps. Additionally, as of June 30, 2023, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $1 million. Our equity investment in a publicly traded company is subject to market price risk, which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activities. As of June 30, 2023, the fair value of our investment in the marketable equity security, which began publicly trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on April 5, 2021, was $18.2 million. Assuming a decline of 50% in market prices, the aggregate value of our investment in the marketable equity security could decrease by approximately $9 million, based on the value as of June 30, 2023.See Note 5 “Marketable Securities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7; and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2023.As of June 30, 2023, we had net forward and option contracts to purchase $329.7 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2023, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $353.3 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $74.5 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.53Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:25.682369

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”) Restatements of Prior Period Consolidated Financial Statements in Previous Filings In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 (filed on January 29, 2007) and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2006, December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2007 (filed on January 29, 2007, February 9, 2007 and May 7, 2007, respectively), we restated (1) our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2005 and 2004; (2) our selected consolidated financial data as of and for our fiscal years ended June 30, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002; and (3) our unaudited quarterly financial data for the first three quarters in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and for all quarters in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. In those filings, to correct our past accounting for stock options, we recorded total additional pre-tax, non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of $375.7 million for periods from July 1, 1994 to June 30, 2007. All financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects that restatement and does not contain any further restatement. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company’s related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller’s price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—system sales, spare part sales and service contracts. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. We also recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer, as follows: • When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment; • When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation; • When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation; 31 Table of Contents • When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications; • When the system is damaged during transit, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer. Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 13.5%, 4.4% and 6.6% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance is primarily driven by increased shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs, and an increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues. Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer, and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed. The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-05, Applicability of SOP 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software. We periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with SOP No. 97-2 and EITF Issue No. 03-05. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value. We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. We write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. 32 Table of Contents Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. See Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Stock-Based Compensation. Beginning July 1, 2005, we have accounted for stock-based compensation using the fair value of stock options based on a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), as clarified by Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107. We elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2007, we recorded stock-based compensation expense totaling the amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method been applied under SFAS No. 123 since the effective date of SFAS No. 123 for the grants made prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, and under SFAS No. 123(R) for the grants made during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006 and 2007. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility of the Company’s common stock. We determined that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than a blended volatility. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we used a combination of historical and implied volatility in deriving the expected volatility assumption. In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position No. 123(R)-3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards (“FSP 123R-3”). We have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FSP 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). We followed paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123(R) to calculate the initial pool of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the Additional Paid-in-Capital (“APIC”) pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of 33 Table of Contents employee stock-based compensation awards that were outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share-based compensation deductions when calculating the windfall benefits and are recognizing the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs. See Note 6, “Stock-Based Compensation” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. Purchased technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We completed the annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2006, and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our best estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be. 34 Table of Contents Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which is effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2008. This statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning July 1, 2008. We are evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2006, the FASB published FASB Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for our Company in fiscal years beginning July 1, 2007. Any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. In addition, the adoption of FIN 48 will result in the reclassification of certain unrecognized tax benefits from current to non-current liabilities in our statement of financial position. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of FIN 48 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. These Statements permit fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. These Statements are effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after July 1, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KLA-Tencor Corporation is the world’s leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Our comprehensive portfolio of products, services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication process—from research and development to final volume production. Revenues, income from operations, net income, cash flow from operations, and diluted earnings per share are some of the key indicators we use to monitor our financial condition and operating performance. The following table sets forth some of the key quarterly unaudited financial information which we use to manage our business. (in thousands, except per share data) First quarter endedSeptember 30,2006 Second quarter endedDecember 31,2006 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2007 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2007 Revenues $ 629,363 $ 649,270 $ 716,208 $ 736,388 Total costs and operating expenses 475,373 570,911 533,553 561,524 Income from operations 153,990 78,359 182,655 174,864 Net income 135,922 90,049 154,785 147,342 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.68 $ 0.45 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 Diluted $ 0.67 $ 0.44 $ 0.76 $ 0.75 (in thousands, except per share data) First quarter endedSeptember 30,2005 SecondquarterendedDecember 31,2005 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2006 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2006 Revenues $ 484,261 $ 487,682 $ 519,648 $ 579,036 Total costs and operating expenses 409,271 412,688 434,721 504,156 Income from operations 74,990 74,994 84,927 74,880 Net income 75,487 76,605 96,684 131,676 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.38 $ 0.39 $ 0.48 $ 0.66 Diluted $ 0.37 $ 0.38 $ 0.47 $ 0.65 Industry Trends As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. The industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity. We expect that our customers’ capital spending on process control to increase over the long term. We believe that this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. We anticipate that these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services over the coming years. The key drivers for growth in the semiconductor equipment industry in calendar year 2007 are the transition to 65nm design nodes, the increased demand for consumer electronics, and the strength of the flash memory market. 36 Table of Contents Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 FY07 vs. FY06 FY06 vs. FY05 Revenues: Product $ 2,308,942 $ 1,713,237 $ 1,767,676 $ 595,705 35 % $ (54,439 ) -3 % Service 422,287 357,390 314,202 64,897 18 % 43,188 14 % Total revenues $ 2,731,229 $ 2,070,627 $ 2,081,878 $ 660,602 $ (11,251 ) Costs of revenues $ 1,190,323 $ 942,091 $ 871,000 $ 248,232 26 % $ 71,091 8 % Stock-based compensation expense included in costs of revenues $ 29,183 $ 29,620 $ 9,167 $ (437 ) -1 % $ 20,453 223 % Gross margin percentage 56 % 55 % 58 % 1 % -3 % Stock-based compensation expense included in costs of revenues as a percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % 0 % 0 % 1 % Product revenues Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily as a result of a higher level of orders received due to our customers’ increased capital spending in the area of process control and yield management. The higher level of customer spending in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was driven by our customers’ demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. Product revenue was relatively flat in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. Service revenues Service revenues are generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. Service revenues continued to increase through the three year period disclosed in the table above as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems. Revenues by region Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands): Year ended June 30, 2007 2006 2005 United States $ 647,813 24 % $ 416,468 20 % $ 494,250 24 % Europe & Israel 271,814 10 % 287,562 14 % 266,048 13 % Japan 600,861 22 % 541,411 26 % 450,240 21 % Taiwan 559,083 20 % 363,014 18 % 429,672 21 % Korea 288,756 11 % 277,316 13 % 148,287 7 % Asia Pacific 362,902 13 % 184,856 9 % 293,381 14 % Total $ 2,731,229 100 % $ 2,070,627 100 % $ 2,081,878 100 % A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that will continue to be the case. 37 Table of Contents Gross margin Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. The increase in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was primarily due to increased revenues and savings realized from our cost reduction initiative during the fiscal year. In addition, the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: • $33.9 million for additional amortization of intangibles and fair value adjustment for inventory related to the acquisitions completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $13.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $4.9 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and • An aggregate of $4.7 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payment to employees to compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which $4.7 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 was primarily due to our cessation of development work related to CDSEM and stock-based compensation expense recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, which contributed 1% and 1%, respectively, to the decrease in gross margin. During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we ceased development work on the next generation equipment for CDSEM and incurred charges of $26.5 million resulting from write-offs of related inventory and other liabilities related to the cessation of future development of CDSEM. Although we have ceased future development of CDSEM, we will continue to service previously sold equipment. Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”) (dollar amounts in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2007 2006 2005 FY07 vs. FY06 FY06 vs. FY05 R&D expenses $ 437,513 $ 393,823 $ 351,984 $ 43,690 11 % $ 41,839 12 % Stock-based compensation expense included in R&D expenses $ 42,431 $ 49,509 $ 12,255 $ (7,078 ) -14 % $ 37,254 304 % R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues 16 % 19 % 17 % -3 % 2 % Stock-based compensation expense included in R&D expense as a percentage of total revenues 2 % 2 % 1 % 0 % 1 % The increase in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily reflects additional expenses related to the following charges recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: • $17.9 million for in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) charges and amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisitions that we completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $12.3 million was recorded in fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $10.0 million for impairment of certain patents recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • An aggregate of $5.8 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Company’s ESPP, which $5.8 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and • $4.3 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. 38 Table of Contents The increase in R&D expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 was primarily attributable to increased stock-based compensation expenses due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we recorded $16.6 million for in-process research and development charges. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting, and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed during fiscal year 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since we did not have any alternative use of these patents and we believe the fair value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. The write off was recorded as $10.0 million to R&D expense and $0.7 million to cost of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. R&D expenses include the benefit of $12.7 million, $11.4 million and $7.9 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase in absolute dollars over the next several years as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) (dollar amounts in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2007 2006 2005 FY07 vs. FY06 FY06 vs. FY05 SG&A expenses $ 513,525 $ 424,922 $ 313,774 $ 88,603 21 % $ 111,148 35 % Stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses $ 37,164 $ 85,613 $ 15,580 $ (48,449 ) -57 % $ 70,033 450 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 19 % 21 % 15 % -2 % 6 % Stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 1 % 4 % 1 % -3 % 3 % 39 Table of Contents The increase in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily reflects additional charges recorded in SG&A as follows: • $56.8 million for impairment charges related to the write-down of buildings which was recorded in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $11.3 million for severance and related benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $6.1 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $12.3 million for additional amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions that we completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $1.7 million is recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $15.8 million for legal and other expenses related to the stock options investigation, shareholder litigation and related matters which was primarily recorded in the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and • $8.0 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to compensate them for lost benefits from the suspension of the Company’s ESPP, which $8.0 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The cumulative increase in SG&A expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was offset in part by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to a reversal of $20.3 million in stock-based compensation expense related to our former Chief Executive Officer. In addition, certain options granted in prior years were fully vested in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 resulting in lower levels of stock-based compensation expense In November 2006, as part of our long-term business plan, we decided to sell certain real estate properties owned by the Company in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. Based on the valuation of these assets, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $56.8 million, which has been included in SG&A during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 15, “Asset Impairment and Severance Charges” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The increase in SG&A expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of stock-based compensation expense due to implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and increased legal costs of $21.1 million attributable to accrued expenses related to the stock option investigation. During November 2005, we announced that effective January 1, 2006, Kenneth L. Schroeder would cease to be our Chief Executive Officer and would thereafter be employed as a Senior Advisor. The Company and Mr. Schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the Company and defined the salary, bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a Senior Advisor. Effective January 1, 2006, we determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with Mr. Schroeder had been satisfied; accordingly, we recorded at that time an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation charge of approximately $9.8 million relating to these equity awards. The above-mentioned charge is included as a component of SG&A expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. On October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices, we terminated all aspects of Mr. Schroeder’s employment relationship and agreement with the Company. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeder’s then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and 0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were canceled. Accordingly, in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 we reversed approximately $20.3 million of the non-cash, stock-based compensation charge recorded in prior periods. In December 2006, we canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. 40 Table of Contents Interest Income and Other, Net Year ended June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Interest income and other, net $ 87,367 $ 68,067 $ 37,956 Percentage of total revenues 3 % 3 % 2 % Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The increases in interest income and other, net, in each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006, as compared to the prior fiscal year were primarily due to higher short-term interest rates. In addition, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we had an equity interest in a development stage company which we consolidated as of March 31, 2004. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we acquired the remaining minority interest in this entity and subsequently sold certain assets of this entity and recorded a gain of $3.9 million. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 22.2%, 0.4% and 24.3% in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In general, our effective income tax rate is a function of benefits realized from our Extraterritorial Income (“ETI”) exclusion, foreign earnings taxed at different rates, research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest. In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2006, the Company reduced its total income tax reserves by $15.3 million and $79.7 million respectively. This was primarily due to expiring statutes of limitations, several tax settlements reached with various tax authorities and reassessments of tax exposures based on the status of current audits in various jurisdictions. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, we entered into a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to an examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we entered into a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board related to an examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, 1998 and 1999. Our benefits for income tax related to equity awards were $34.5 million, $58.2 million and $12.1 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non tax-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, amounts of tax-exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. The statute of limitations has expired for franchise taxes in California, the state in which the Company’s headquarters are located, through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, and the Internal Revenue Service completed an audit of the Company’s corporate tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. Liabilities for anticipated worldwide tax audit issues have been established based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are probable. The Company believes that adequate reserves have been provided to cover any potential additional tax assessments. Equity Incentive Program Our equity incentive program is a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain key employees, and align stockholder and employee interests. The equity incentive program consists of two plans: one under which non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock, and another in which non-employee directors, officers, key employees, consultants and all other employees may be 41 Table of Contents granted options to purchase shares of our stock, restricted stock units and other types of equity awards. For the past several years until June 30, 2006, stock options (except for the retroactively priced options which were granted primarily prior to fiscal year 2002) were generally granted at the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, with a vesting period of five years and an exercise period not to exceed seven years (ten years for options granted prior to July 1, 2005) from the date of issuance. Restricted stock units may be granted with varying criteria such as time-based or performance-based vesting. Substantially all of our employees that meet established performance goals and qualify as key employees participate in our main equity incentive plan. Since July 1, 2006, we have granted only restricted stock units under our equity incentive program, except for options granted to non-employee directors as part of their regular compensation package for service through June 30, 2007. On October 18, 2004, our stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”) which provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of our common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units to our employees, consultants and members of our Board of Directors. Since the adoption of the 2004 Plan, no further grants are permitted under the 1982 Stock Option Plan or 2000 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan. The 2004 Plan permits the issuance of up to 12.5 million shares of common stock, of which 3.3 million shares were available for grant as of June 30, 2007. Any 2004 Plan awards of restricted stock, performance shares, performance units or deferred stock units with a per share or unit purchase price lower than 100% of fair market value on the grant date shall be counted against the total number of shares issuable under the 2004 Plan as 1.8 shares for every one share subject thereto. Total options and restricted stock units outstanding under all plans as of June 30, 2007 were 19.6 million and 3.4 million, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Expense Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award which is computed using a Black-Scholes option valuation model, and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The following table shows stock-based compensation expense by type of award for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Year ended June 30, (in thousands ) 2007 2006 2005 Stock-based compensation expense by type of award: Employee stock options $ 82,440 $ 140,447 $ 34,902 Employee stock purchase plan 11,964 16,188 — Restricted stock units 14,374 8,107 2,139 Total stock-based compensation $ 108,778 $ 164,742 $ 37,041 The decrease in stock-based compensation expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to a reversal of $20.3 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the cancellation of options and restricted stock units previously held by our former Chief Executive Officer. In addition, certain options granted in prior years were fully vested in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 resulting in lower levels of stock-based compensation expense. These decreases were offset by $9.3 million of cash compensation related to bonuses payable to the holders of amended options to compensate them for the increase in their option exercise price. The increase in stock-based compensation expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 is primarily due to the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). As of June 30, 2007, the unrecognized stock-based compensation balance related to stock options was $106.0 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.6 years. As of June 30, 2007, the unrecognized stock-based compensation balance related to restricted stock units was $71.2 million and will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 3.2 years. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 722,511 $ 1,129,191 $ 663,163 Short-term marketable securities 988,118 1,196,605 1,532,023 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,710,629 $ 2,325,796 $ 2,195,186 Percentage of total assets 37 % 51 % 54 % Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Cash provided by operating activities $ 610,686 $ 315,169 $ 506,735 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (399,268 ) 225,070 (124,598 ) Cash used in financing activities (633,227 ) (84,959 ) (81,069 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 15,129 10,748 8,213 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (406,680 ) $ 466,028 $ 309,281 We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 consisted primarily of net income of $528.1 million increased by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $109.3 million, stock-based compensation of $99.6 million and non-cash impairment charges of $67.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $107.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $45.6 million, a decrease in deferred system profit of $24.4 million and increase in other assets of $19.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 consisted primarily of net income of $380.5 million increased by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $69.4 million, stock-based compensation of $164.7 million, tax benefit from equity awards of $31.9 million and an increase in accounts payable of $27.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $114.9 million, an increase in inventories of $87.7 million, and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $134.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 consisted primarily of net income of $445.0 million increased by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $70.2 million, stock-based compensation of $37.0 million, decrease in accounts receivable of $36.6 million and decrease in other assets and liabilities of $42.8 million partially offset by a decrease in deferred system profit of $70.8 million and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $53.5 million. Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long-term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we paid $521.7 million for acquisitions completed during the fiscal year including the acquisition of certain assets of a development stage company. Also, purchases of capital assets in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 includes purchases of $29.9 million related to our Singapore facility. Financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock. Issuance of common stock provided $263.2 million, $212.7 million and $133.6 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We used $808.5 million, $221.4 million and $203.7 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. The stock repurchase program was suspended in May 2006 and resumed in February 2007. The increase from fiscal year 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the Accelerated Share Repurchase (“ASR”) program described below. This increase in our share repurchases is the primary reason for the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2007 versus June 30, 2006. 43 Table of Contents During the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, our Board of Directors also approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and declared a dividend of $0.12 per share of our outstanding common stock. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $95.1 million, $95.4 million and $23.6 million, respectively. Further, a dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008 was declared in August, 2007 and will be paid on September 1, 2007 to our stockholders on record as of August 20, 2007. In February 2007, we entered into an ASR program with a third-party investment bank and prepaid $750.0 million to repurchase its common stock. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the ASR was determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR agreement, subject to a maximum price per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock under the ASR, of which 2.0 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The shares repurchased under the ASR decreased our basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Following the conclusion of the fiscal year covered by this report, in August 2007, the Board of Directors authorized KLA-Tencor to repurchase up to an additional 10.0 million shares of its common stock under the repurchase program. The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2007: (in thousands) Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Purchase commitments $ 145,548 $ 143,574 $ 1,974 $ — $ — $ — $ — Operating leases 38,218 10,364 7,956 5,400 3,913 2,308 8,277 Pension obligations 10,387 864 924 976 1,001 902 5,720 Other obligations 20,640 20,640 — — — — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 214,793 $ 175,442 $ 10,854 $ 6,376 $ 4,914 $ 3,210 $ 13,997 We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, Letters of Credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods. The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended June 30, 2007 and 2006: Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2007 2006 2005 Receivables sold under factoring agreements $ 278,560 $ 277,960 $ 306,175 Proceeds from sales of LCs $ 61,850 $ 69,286 $ 29,602 Discounting fees paid on sales of LCs(1) $ 804 $ 788 $ 195 (1) Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest and other income net. We maintain guarantee arrangements of $27.9 million in various locations to fund customs guarantee for VAT and LC needs of its subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. Approximately $18.4 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2007. We maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted 44 Table of Contents time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitment as of June 30, 2007 to be approximately $145.5 million which are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited or no historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 11 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Because virtually all holders of retroactively priced options issued by the Company were not involved in or aware of the retroactive pricing, the Company has taken certain actions to deal with the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of retroactively priced options. The adverse tax consequences are that retroactively priced stock options vesting after December 31, 2004 (“409A Affected Options”) subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws). One such action by the Company involved offering to amend the 409A Affected Options to increase the exercise price to the market price on the actual grant date or, if lower, the market price at the time of the amendment. The amended options are not subject to taxation under IRC Section 409A. Under IRS regulations, these option amendments had to be completed by December 31, 2006 for anyone who was an executive officer when he or she received 409A Affected Options; the amendments for non-officers do not need to be completed until December 31, 2007. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we accrued approximately $20.2 million payable to non-executive holders of the amended options to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise prices. The $20.2 million is payable in January 2008. Of the $20.2 million, $9.3 million was recorded as stock-based compensation expense, and the remaining $10.9 million was recorded in common stock and capital in excess of par value in the balance sheet. The amount of these bonuses will effectively repaid to the Company if and when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price is paid. However, there is no assurance that the options will be exercised and the employees will retain the bonuses under all circumstances. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we also recorded approximately $13.9 million to compensate certain option holders whose employment had terminated, or who had already exercised 409A Affected Options, for the additional taxes they incurred under IRC Section 409A (and, as applicable, similar state tax laws). Three of the Company’s option holders were subject to the December 31, 2006 deadline described above. Accordingly, in December 2006, the Company offered to amend the 409A Affected Options held by Mr. Wallace, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and two former executive officers to increase the exercise price so that these options will not subject the option holder to a penalty tax under IRC Section 409A. All three individuals accepted the Company’s offer. In addition, the Company agreed to pay each of the three individuals a cash bonus in January 2008 equal to the aggregate increase in the exercise prices for his amended options. For Mr. Wallace, the amount of this bonus is $0.4 million. To account for these actions, the Company has recorded a charge of $0.3 million, net of amount reclassified from capital in excess of par, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. We are involved in several litigation cases as described in Note 12, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these cases, and we cannot estimate the likelihood or potential dollar amount of any adverse results. 45 Table of Contents Working capital decreased to $2,179.6 million as of June 30, 2007, compared to $2,594.5 million as of June 30, 2006. This decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the ASR program and acquisitions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1,710.6 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Under our foreign-currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months. The outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows: As of June 30, (in thousands) 2007 2006 Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase $ 4,651 $ 15,173 Sell (242,942 ) (167,525 ) Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase 126,992 128,406 Sell (265,378 ) (260,165 ) Net $ (376,677 ) $ (284,111 ) 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2007. Actual results may differ materially. As of June 30, 2007, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $988.1 million, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents (detail of these securities is included in Note 3, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2007, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $5.1 million. As of June 30, 2007, we had net forward contracts to sell $376.7 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 13, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2007, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $365.0 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $50.3 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on income or cash flows. 47 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:47.144338
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company’s related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller’s price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—system sales, spare part sales and service contracts. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. We also recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer, as follows: • When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment; • When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation; • When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation; • When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications; • When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer. Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 16%, 14% and 4% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance is primarily driven by increased shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs as well as an increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation, primarily with respect to sales of products of companies that we have acquired during the past two fiscal years. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues. 29 Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer, and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed. The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-05, Applicability of SOP 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software. We periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with SOP No. 97-2 and EITF Issue No. 03-05. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value. We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. We write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. See Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we 30 perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Stock-Based Compensation. Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, the fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. We believe that the implied volatility is reflective of market conditions. Prior to July 1, 2005, we applied Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated settlement costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. Purchased technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. See Note 5, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We completed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, which evaluation indicated that there was no such impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. 31 On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We adopted FIN 48 on July 1, 2007. See Note 11, “Income Taxes” to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment. 32 Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. We do not expect that this Statement will result in a change in any of our current accounting practices. In April 2008, the FASB adopted FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This FASB Staff Position is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 142-3 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of SFAS No. 133. This statement changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 161 will require us to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why we use derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for our interim period beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2008, the FASB adopted FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the purchase method be used for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) requires expensing of acquisition-related and restructure-related costs, remeasurement of earn-out provisions at fair value, measurement of equity securities issued for purchase at the date of close of the transaction and non-expensing of in-process research and development related intangibles. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009, except that resolution of certain tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business combinations, which previously were adjusted to goodwill, will be adjusted to income tax expense for all such adjustments after July 1, 2009, regardless of the date of the original business combination. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. This Statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 160 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 33 In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities. This issue provides that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. EITF Issue No. 07-3 is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 07-3 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, which is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008. This statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 34 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KLA-Tencor Corporation is the world’s leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. Within our primary area of focus, our comprehensive portfolio of products, services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire fabrication process – from research and development to final volume production. Our products are also used in a number of other industries, including light emitting diode, data storage, and solar cell and wafer production. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of wafer, IC, disk and reticle manufacturers in the world. Our revenues are driven largely by capital spending by our customers that operate in one or more of several key markets, including the memory, foundry and logic markets. Over the past few years, customers in the memory market have made significant increases in capital spending and, as a consequence, contributed an increased share of our revenues. These customers, however, have been adversely impacted by a challenging pricing environment in fiscal 2008 for their products, and consequently have scaled back their investments in new production capacity. Our customers purchase our products to either ramp up production in response to the need to drive advances in process technologies or to satisfy demand from industries such as communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive, and aerospace. Our customers today are investing in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as reduced cost, which in turn are driving increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity. While demand from various industries continues to steadily rise, the demand for our products is affected by profitability of our customers which is driven by capacity and market supply for their products as well as the global macroeconomic environment. Our revenues have declined sequentially over the past four quarters and reflect slowing worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment. Industry analysts expect demand for capital equipment to decline in calendar year 2008 compared to calendar year 2007. Such a decline would affect our revenue levels in future quarters. While capacity driven purchases by our customers are adversely impacted in environments such as the one we are currently in, the demand for technology driven purchases are less susceptible to business cycles. As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. The industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity. We expect our customers’ capital spending on process control to constitute a higher portion of their capital spending over time. We believe that this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. We anticipate that these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services such as ours over the coming years. The key drivers in the semiconductor equipment industry today are the competitive pressures for our customers to improve yields, lower their costs and get products to market more quickly in order to benefit from the increased demand for products from the consumer electronics, computing and communication industries. We continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, KLA-Tencor completed a number of acquisitions including ADE Corporation, OnWafer Technologies, Inc., SensArray Corporation, Japan ADE, Ltd, and Therma-Wave, Inc. Most recently, in June 2008, we completed the acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV primarily to expand our product portfolio in semiconductor packaging inspection and to gain entry into the solar cell inspection and light-emitting diode (“LED”) wafer inspection markets. ICOS is a leading supplier of packaging and interconnect inspection solutions for the back-end markets in semiconductor industry, and also has a market leadership position in the inspection of photovoltaic solar technologies and LED wafers. The results of operations of ICOS are included in the following table from the date of the acquisition of majority control on May 30, 2008. 35 The following table sets forth some of our key quarterly unaudited financial information: (in thousands, except per share data) FirstquarterendedSeptember 30,2007 SecondquarterendedDecember 31,2007 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2008 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2008 Total revenues $ 693,020 $ 635,783 $ 602,219 $ 590,694 Total costs and operating expenses 515,742 542,296 477,019 487,283 Income from operations 177,278 93,487 125,200 103,411 Net income 88,158 83,935 110,980 76,010 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.47 $ 0.46 $ 0.62 $ 0.43 Diluted $ 0.46 $ 0.45 $ 0.61 $ 0.43 (in thousands, except per share data) FirstquarterendedSeptember 30,2006 SecondquarterendedDecember 31,2006 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2007 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2007 Total revenues $ 629,363 $ 649,270 $ 716,208 $ 736,388 Total costs and operating expenses 475,373 570,911 533,553 561,524 Income from operations 153,990 78,359 182,655 174,864 Net income 135,922 90,049 154,785 147,342 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.68 $ 0.45 $ 0.78 $ 0.77 Diluted $ 0.67 $ 0.44 $ 0.76 $ 0.75 Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 FY08 vs. FY07 FY07 vs. FY06 Revenues: Product $ 2,030,224 $ 2,308,942 $ 1,713,237 $ (278,718 ) -12 % $ 595,705 35 % Service 491,492 422,287 357,390 69,205 16 % 64,897 18 % Total revenues $ 2,521,716 $ 2,731,229 $ 2,070,627 $ (209,513 ) $ 660,602 Costs of revenues $ 1,145,416 $ 1,190,323 $ 942,091 $ (44,907 ) -4 % $ 248,232 26 % Stock-based compensation expense included in costs of revenues $ 22,041 $ 29,183 $ 29,620 $ (7,142 ) -24 % $ (437 ) -1 % Gross margin percentage 55 % 56 % 55 % -1 % 1 % Stock-based compensation expense included in costs of revenues as a percentage of total revenues 1 % 1 % 1 % 0 % 0 % Product revenues Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 primarily as a result of reduced capital spending by our customers due to ongoing weakness in the semiconductor industry and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment. The decline in revenues reflects slowing worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment, as semiconductor companies reduce capital spending and conserve cash in response to their business environment, even as their need for more precise diagnostics capabilities increases with technological advances. 36 Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 primarily as a result of a higher level of orders received due to our customers’ increased capital spending in the area of process control and yield management. The higher level of customer spending in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was driven by our customers’ demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, one customer accounted for 13% of net accounts receivable. Service revenues Service revenues are generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. Service revenues continued to increase through the three year period disclosed in the table above as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems. Revenues by region Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands): Year ended June 30, 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 518,851 21 % $ 647,813 24 % $ 416,468 20 % Europe & Israel 305,350 12 % 271,814 10 % 287,562 14 % Japan 617,214 24 % 600,861 22 % 541,411 26 % Taiwan 570,904 23 % 559,083 20 % 363,014 18 % Korea 225,119 9 % 288,756 11 % 277,316 13 % Asia Pacific 284,278 11 % 362,902 13 % 184,856 9 % Total $ 2,521,716 100 % $ 2,731,229 100 % $ 2,070,627 100 % A significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that will continue to be the case. Gross margin Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. The decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was primarily due to $21.4 million of inventory write downs related to disposal of service inventory as well as discontinued products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. In addition, the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: • $41.0 million for amortization of intangibles, impairment of intangibles and fair value adjustment for inventory related to the acquisitions, of which $12.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; and • $3.2 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction. 37 The increase in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to increased revenues and savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives during the fiscal year. In addition, the following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: • $33.9 million for amortization of intangibles and fair value adjustment for inventory related to the acquisitions completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $13.8 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $4.9 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and • An aggregate of $4.7 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payment to employees to compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which $4.7 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”) (dollar amounts in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2008 2007 2006 FY08 vs. FY07 FY07 vs. FY06 R&D expenses $ 409,973 $ 437,513 $ 393,823 $ (27,540 ) -6 % $ 43,690 11 % Stock-based compensation expense included in R&D expenses $ 32,623 $ 42,431 $ 49,509 $ (9,808 ) -23 % $ (7,078 ) -14 % R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues 16 % 16 % 19 % 0 % -3 % Stock-based compensation expense included in R&D expense as a percentage of total revenues 1 % 2 % 2 % -1 % 0 % The decrease in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to the absence of any impairment charges and lower stock-based compensation expense due to our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units, which carry with them lower stock-based compensation expense. The following charges were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: • $22.7 million for in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) charges associated with the acquisitions that we had completed as of June 30, 2008, of which $18.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; • $2.1 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions, of which $0.7 million was recorded in fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; • $1.3 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction; and • $32.6 million for stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to $42.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Of the $32.6 million recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $8.9 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The increase in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 primarily reflects additional expenses related to the following charges recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: • $16.6 million for IPR&D charges associated with the acquisitions that we had completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $12.0 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; 38 • $1.3 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions, of which $0.3 million was recorded in fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $10.0 million for impairment of certain patents, all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • An aggregate of $5.8 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to compensate them for lost benefits resulting from the suspension of the Company’s ESPP, which $5.8 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and • $4.3 million for severance and benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $2.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, we expensed IPR&D of $22.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively, upon the completion of the acquisitions during the fiscal years in connection with acquired intellectual property for which technological feasibility has not been established and no future alternative uses exist. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting, and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements. As of June 30, 2008, there have been no material changes from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired IPR&D. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed to us during fiscal year 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since we did not have any alternative use for these patents and we believe the fair value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. The write off was recorded as $10.0 million to R&D expense and $0.7 million to cost of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. R&D expenses include the benefit of $20.4 million, $12.7 million and $11.4 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase in absolute dollars over the next several years as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. 39 Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) (dollar amounts in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2008 2007 2006 FY08 vs. FY07 FY07 vs. FY06 SG&A expenses $ 466,951 $ 513,525 $ 424,922 $ (46,574 ) -9 % $ 88,603 21 % Stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses $ 51,806 $ 37,164 $ 85,613 $ 14,642 39 % $ (48,449 ) -57 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 19 % 19 % 21 % 0 % -2 % Stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 2 % 1 % 4 % 1 % -3 % The decrease in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to gains recognized on sale of our certain real estate assets, lower severance and benefits related to employee workforce reduction, lower stock-based compensation expense and improvements in our operational efficiency. The following charges and gains were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: • $20.1 million gain on sale of our real estate assets, of which $2.5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; • $4.0 million for severance and related benefits related to an employee workforce reduction; • $10.4 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions that we had completed as of June 30, 2008, of which $3.7 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008; • $75.9 million charge to cover the $65.0 million settlement plus related litigation expenses for the pending shareholder class action litigation relating to the Company’s historical stock option practices, as described in Note 13, “Litigation and Other Legal Matters” to our Consolidated Financial Statements; and • $51.8 million for stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to $37.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. Of the $51.8 million recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, $15.0 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The increase in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 primarily reflects additional charges recorded in SG&A as follows: • $56.8 million for impairment charges related to the write-down of buildings, which was recorded in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $11.3 million for severance and related benefits related to an employee workforce reduction, of which $6.1 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $12.3 million for amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions that we had completed as of June 30, 2007, of which $1.7 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; • $15.8 million for legal and other expenses related to the stock options investigation, shareholder litigation and related matters, which charges were primarily recorded in the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007; and • $8.0 million for reimbursement of taxes to employees, including management, related to IRC Section 409A and cash payments to employees to compensate them for lost benefits from the suspension of the Company’s ESPP, which $8.0 million amount was recorded primarily in the second and third quarters of fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The cumulative increase in SG&A expenses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The decrease 40 in stock-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to a reversal of $20.3 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the termination of employment of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer. The year-over-year decrease in stock-based compensation expense was also partially caused by the completion of vesting during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 of certain options granted in prior years, as well as our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units, which carry with them lower stock-based compensation expense. In November 2006, as part of our long-term business plan, we decided to sell certain real estate properties owned by the Company in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. Based on the valuation of these assets, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $56.8 million, which has been included in SG&A during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 16, “Sale and Impairment of Real Estate Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. During November 2005, we announced that effective January 1, 2006, Kenneth L. Schroeder would cease to be our Chief Executive Officer and would thereafter be employed as a Senior Advisor. The Company and Mr. Schroeder also revised his prior agreement with the Company and defined the salary, bonus payout and equity award vesting during the period of his employment as a Senior Advisor. Effective January 1, 2006, we determined that all service conditions associated with certain prior equity awards under the terms of the revised agreement with Mr. Schroeder had been satisfied; accordingly, we recorded at that time an additional non-cash, stock-based compensation charge of approximately $9.8 million relating to these equity awards. The above-mentioned charge is included as a component of SG&A expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. On October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices, we terminated all aspects of Mr. Schroeder’s employment relationship and agreement with the Company. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeder’s then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and 0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were canceled. Accordingly, in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the Company reversed $20.3 million of the non-cash, stock-based compensation charges in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 43 of SFAS No. 123(R), because Mr. Schroeder would no longer be able to fulfill his service obligations. The $20.3 million reversal related to the charges that had been recorded in prior periods related to unvested option shares and restricted stock award shares. In December 2006, the Company canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. In accordance with paragraph 57 of SFAS No. 123(R), previously recognized stock-based compensation expense related to these awards was not reversed upon cancellation. Interest Income and Other, Net Year ended June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Interest income and other, net $ 71,625 $ 90,148 $ 70,242 Interest expense $ 10,767 $ 2,781 $ 2,175 Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues 3 % 3 % 3 % Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues 0 % 0 % 0 % Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The decrease in interest income and other, net in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily due to the lower interest income earned on lower average cash balance during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increase in interest expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily due to additional interest expense as a result of the issuance of 41 $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The increase in interest income and other, net in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 was primarily due to higher short-term interest rates. In addition, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we had an equity interest in a development stage company which we have been consolidating since March 31, 2004. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we acquired the remaining minority interest in this entity and subsequently sold certain assets of this entity and recorded a gain of $3.9 million. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 35.9%, 22.2% and 0.4% in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In general, our effective income tax rate is a function of benefits realized from our Extraterritorial Income (“ETI”) exclusion, domestic manufacturing deduction (“DMD”), foreign earnings taxed at different rates, research and development tax credits and tax exempt interest. In addition, our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 included $52.9 million of incremental U.S. tax expense associated with the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy. The incremental U.S. tax expense was a result of an inter-company licensing agreement related to the migration of manufacturing to Singapore. That increase in our U.S. tax expense was partially offset by a benefit of $14.4 million that we recognized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 resulting from revising the amount of prior year cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 included a reduction in tax expense of $15.3 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of an examination by the State of California for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 to June 30, 1999, receipt by the Company of a federal tax refund for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation’s confirmation of the Internal Revenue Service’s audit findings related to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 included a reduction in tax expense of $79.7 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of a federal income tax examination of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2004, and the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to federal taxes for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2001 and June 30, 2002. We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”), on July 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we increased the liability for net unrecognized tax benefits by $8.4 million, and accounted for the increase as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of $8.4 million at July 1, 2007. We have historically classified accruals for tax uncertainties in current taxes payable. Upon adoption of FIN 48, we have reclassified taxes payable of $62.1 million from current to non-current liability. As of the adoption date of FIN 48, we had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $77.2 million, of which $72.5 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, while the remaining $4.7 million would reduce acquisition-related goodwill. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $12.5 million, related to various tax positions including the filing of an amended Federal income tax return for the year ended June 30, 2005. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within interest income and other, net. As of the adoption date of FIN 48, we had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $12.9 million. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $4.0 million as a result of the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for the year. We conduct business globally and, as a result, we and one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in various jurisdictions throughout the world, including with the United States federal government, various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. The Company is not under federal income tax examination at this time. We 42 remain subject to federal income tax examination for all years from the year ended June 30, 2005. We are subject to state income tax examinations for all years from the year ended June 30, 2003. We are also subject to examinations in major foreign jurisdictions, including Japan, Israel and Singapore, for all years from the year ended June 30, 2003 and are currently under tax examinations in various foreign tax jurisdictions. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non tax-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, amounts of tax-exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,128,106 $ 722,511 $ 1,129,191 Marketable securities 451,277 988,118 1,196,605 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,579,383 $ 1,710,629 $ 2,325,796 Percentage of total assets 33 % 37 % 51 % Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 668,175 $ 610,686 $ 315,169 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 52,499 (399,268 ) 225,070 Net cash used in financing activities (318,938 ) (633,227 ) (84,959 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 3,859 15,129 10,748 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 405,595 $ (406,680 ) $ 466,028 At June 30, 2008, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.6 billion, a decrease of $131.2 million from June 30, 2007. We generated $668.2 million in cash from operations and an additional $52.5 million from our investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. We used $318.9 million in cash for financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. We used $1.1 billion for the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase program, and we raised $744.6 million from the issuance of long-term debt. We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $668.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 consisted primarily of net income of $359.1 million, increased by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $126.4 million, stock-based compensation of $106.5 million, a decrease in inventories of $100.2 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $149.3 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. These increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $178.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 consisted primarily of net income of $528.1 million increased by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $109.3 million, stock-based compensation of $99.6 million and non-cash impairment charges of $67.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $107.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $45.6 million, a decrease in deferred system profit of $24.4 million and increase in other assets of $19.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 consisted primarily of net income of $380.5 million increased by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $69.4 million, stock-based compensation of $164.7 million, tax benefit from equity awards of $31.9 million and an increase in accounts 43 payable of $27.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $114.9 million, an increase in inventories of $87.7 million, and an increase in net deferred income tax assets of $134.4 million. Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long-term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we paid $494.0 million for acquisitions completed during the fiscal year which was primarily for the acquisition of ICOS. Also, sales of certain real estate assets during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 generated $68.8 million. Financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we generated $744.6 million in cash from the issuance of long-term debt, offset by $7.4 million in debt issuance costs. Issuances of common stock provided $155.6 million, $263.2 million and $212.7 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We used $1.1 billion, $808.5 million and $221.4 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. The stock repurchase program was suspended in May 2006 and resumed in February 2007. The increase from fiscal year 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the Accelerated Share Repurchase (“ASR”) program described below. This increase in our share repurchases is the primary reason for the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of June 30, 2007 as compared to June 30, 2006. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $108.5 million, $95.1 million and $95.4 million, respectively. Further, a dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 was declared in August 2008 and will be paid on September 2, 2008 to our stockholders on record as of August 18, 2008. In February 2007, we entered into an ASR program with a third-party investment bank and prepaid $750.0 million to repurchase our common stock. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the ASR was determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR agreement, subject to a maximum price per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock under the ASR, of which 2.0 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The shares repurchased under the ASR decreased our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2008: Fiscal year ending June 30, (in thousands) Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Other(1) Long-term debt obligations(2) $ 750,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 750,000 — Interest expense associated with long-term debt obligations 508,875 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 250,125 — Purchase commitments 124,348 123,127 1,221 — — — — — Litigation settlement 64,750 64,750 — — — — — — Non-current income tax payable 63,634 — — — — — — 63,634 Operating leases 37,632 11,337 8,185 5,630 2,573 1,853 8,054 — Pension obligations 12,322 1,087 1,190 1,239 1,064 1,110 6,632 — Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,561,561 $ 252,051 $ 62,346 $ 58,619 $ 55,387 $ 54,713 $ 1,014,811 $ 63,634 (1) Represents the non-current tax payable obligation under FIN 48. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. (2) In April 2008, the Company issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018. 44 We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods. The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Year ended June 30, (in thousands) 2008 2007 2006 Receivables sold under factoring agreements $ 290,250 $ 278,560 $ 277,960 Proceeds from sales of LCs $ 39,379 $ 61,850 $ 69,286 Discounting fees paid on sales of LCs(1) $ 232 $ 804 $ 788 (1) Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest and other income net. We maintain guarantee arrangements of $28.6 million in various locations to fund customs guarantee for VAT and LC needs of its subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. Approximately $20.8 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2008. We maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitment as of June 30, 2008 to be approximately $124.3 million, which are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 12, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Working capital decreased to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2008, compared to $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2007. This decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the share repurchase program and acquisitions in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 offset by cash generated from operations and the debt offering. As of June 30, 2008, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities, which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years. They are usually found in the form of municipal bonds, preferred stock, and a pool of student loans or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset, typically every seven to 45 forty-nine days, through an auction process. At the end of each reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par. The auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are collateralized, insured and guaranteed by the United States Federal Department of Education. In addition, all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either AAA or Aaa. In February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $48.2 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. These failures are not believed to be a credit issue, but rather caused by a lack of liquidity. The funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. As a result, we have classified these securities with failed auctions as long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheet. During the quarter ended June 30, 2008, $4.8 million of the auction rate securities with a net book value of $4.6 million was called at par by the issuer; therefore no losses were recognized on this security. The balance of our long-term marketable securities at June 30, 2008 was $42.1 million. Although we believe these securities continue to represent sound investments, we may be forced to sell some of our auction rate securities portfolio under illiquid market conditions, which could result in our recognizing a loss on such sales. As of June 30, 2008, we recorded a temporary impairment charge of $0.8 million (net of tax of $0.5 million) in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity. We estimated the fair value using a discounted cash flow model incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Some of these assumptions include estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Under our foreign-currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months. The outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows: As of June 30, (in thousands) 2008 2007 Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase $ 7,413 $ 4,651 Sell (200,676 ) (242,942 ) Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase 1,278,395 126,992 Sell (1,402,119 ) (265,378 ) Net $ (316,987 ) $ (376,677 ) 46 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2008. Actual results may differ materially. As of June 30, 2008, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $451.3 million, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents (detail of these securities is included in Note 3, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2008, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $1.4 million. As of June 30, 2008, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $317.0 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 14, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2008, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $359.7 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $44.8 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on income or cash flows. See Note 3, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,”; and Item 1A, “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at June 30, 2008. In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. At June 30, 2008, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $744.7 million and $728.9 million, respectively. 47",2023-12-30 20:54:46.450314

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company’s related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the seller’s price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer, as follows: • When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. • When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation. • When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation. • When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications. • When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer. Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 14%, 16% and 14% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 is primarily driven by lower shipments of tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily driven by 34 Table of Contents increase in sales of systems with perfunctory installation, primarily with respect to sales of products of companies that we have acquired during the past two fiscal years. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues. Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Services performed in absence of a contract, such as consulting and training revenue, are recognized when the related services are performed, and collectability is reasonably assured. The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Software is incidental to our products as determined in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 03-05, Applicability of SOP 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software. We periodically review the software element of our systems in accordance with SOP No. 97-2 and EITF Issue No. 03-05. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and reserves are recorded to state the demonstration units at their net realizable value. We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. We write down inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature 35 Table of Contents products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Stock-Based Compensation. Effective July 1, 2005, we adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, the fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. We believe that the implied volatility is reflective of market conditions. Prior to July 1, 2005, we applied Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and its related Interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. As required by SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. Purchased technology, patents, trademarks and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis which approximates their estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment under SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, and concluded that the carrying value of our Metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. Our impairment evaluation of goodwill was based on comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates and operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. Unanticipated changes in revenue, gross margin, long-term growth factor or discount rate could result in a material impact on the estimated fair values of our reporting units. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. 36 Table of Contents Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. We adopted FIN 48 on July 1, 2007. See Note 12, “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment. Fair Value Measurements. We adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, as of the beginning of fiscal year 2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) SFAS No. 157-2, which allows companies to elect a one-year delay in applying SFAS No. 157 to certain fair value measurements, primarily related to nonfinancial instruments. We elected the delayed adoption date for the portions of SFAS No. 157 impacted by FSP SFAS No. 157-2. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for 37 Table of Contents measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under SFAS No. 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under SFAS No. 157 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Concurrently with our adoption of SFAS No. 157, we adopted SFAS No. 159, Establishing the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities, which permits entities to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles—a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162. SFAS No. 168 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. This SFAS is effective for our interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2009. This SFAS is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). SFAS No. 167 changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. This SFAS is effective for our interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 167 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events. SFAS No. 165 is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This SFAS requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. The disclosure requirement under this SFAS is effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies. FSP SFAS No. 141(R)-1 will amend the provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination under SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. The FSP will carry forward the requirements in SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, for acquired contingencies, thereby requiring that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period. Otherwise, entities would typically account for the acquired contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The FSP will have the same effective date as SFAS No. 141(R), and will therefore be effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of FSP SFAS No. 141(R)-1 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 38 Table of Contents In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly. FSP SFAS No. 157-4 provides guidelines for making fair value measurements more consistent with the principles presented in SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The FSP relates to determining fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales. It reaffirms what SFAS No. 157 states is the objective of fair value measurement—to reflect how much an asset would be sold for in an orderly transaction (as opposed to a distressed or forced transaction) at the date of the financial statements under current market conditions. Specifically, it reaffirms the need to use judgment to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. The FSP is effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009. The implementation of FSP SFAS No. 157-4 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. FSP SFAS No. 107-1 and APB 28-1 enhances consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures. The FSP relates to fair value disclosures for any financial instruments that are not currently reflected on a company’s balance sheet at fair value. Prior to the effective date of this FSP, fair values for these assets and liabilities have only been disclosed once a year. The FSP will now require these disclosures on a quarterly basis, providing qualitative and quantitative information about fair value estimates for all those financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value. The disclosure requirement under this FSP is effective for our interim reporting period ending on September 30, 2009. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS No. 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS No. 124-2 provides additional guidance designed to create greater clarity and consistency in accounting and presenting impairment losses on securities. The FSP is intended to bring greater consistency to the timing of impairment recognition, and provide greater clarity to investors about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold. The measure of impairment in comprehensive income remains fair value. The FSP also requires increased and more timely disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses, and an aging of securities with unrealized losses. The FSP is effective for our annual reporting for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2009. The implementation of FSP SFAS No. 115-2 and SFAS No. 124-2 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 132(R)-1, Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. FSP SFAS No. 132(R)-1 amends SFAS No. 132(R) to provide guidance on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The FSP requires disclosures surrounding how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies. The disclosure requirement under this FSP is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active. FSP SFAS No. 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, which we adopted as of July 1, 2008, in situations where the market for a particular financial asset is not active. We have considered the guidance provided by FSP SFAS No. 157-3 in its determination of estimated fair values, and the impact was not material. On August 27, 2008, the SEC announced that they will issue for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by U.S. issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board. Under the proposed roadmap, we could be required in fiscal year 2014 to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The SEC is expected to make a determination in 39 Table of Contents 2011 regarding the mandatory adoption of IFRS. We are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial statements, and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of IFRS. In April 2008, the FASB adopted FSP SFAS No. 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This FSP is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after July 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of FSP SFAS No. 142-3 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2008, the FASB adopted FSP SFAS No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of the deferred portion of SFAS No. 157 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements of the original pronouncement requiring that the purchase method be used for all business combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination, establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control and requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their fair values as of the acquisition date. In addition, SFAS No. 141(R) requires expensing of acquisition-related and restructure-related costs, remeasurement of earn-out provisions at fair value, measurement of equity securities issued for purchase at the date of close of the transaction and non-expensing of in-process research and development related intangibles. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009, except that resolution of certain tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business combinations, which previously were adjusted to goodwill, will be adjusted to income tax expense for all such adjustments after July 1, 2009, regardless of the date of the original business combination. We are currently evaluating the impact of the implementation of SFAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51. This SFAS amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. This SFAS establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009. This SFAS is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 40 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Within our primary area of focus, our comprehensive portfolio of products, services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process – from research and development to final volume production. In addition to the semiconductor industry, our technologies serve a number of other industries, including light emitting diode (“LED”), data storage, solar process development and control, and general materials research. Our products and services are used by virtually every major wafer, IC and photomask manufacturer in the world. Our revenues are driven largely by capital spending by our customers who operate in one or more of several key semiconductor markets, including the memory, foundry and logic markets. Our customers purchase our products either in response to the need to drive advances in process technologies or to ramp up production to satisfy demand from industries such as communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive and aerospace. We believe that, over the long-term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as reduced cost, which in turn will drive increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity. As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. The industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity. We expect our customers’ technology-related capital spending on process control (as differentiated from capacity-related capital spending) to increase over the long term, as technology spending is driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new devices and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. However, our ability to predict future capacity-related capital spending by our customers is more limited, as such spending is more closely connected to the unpredictable business cycles within their industries. The demand for our products is generally affected by the profitability of our customers, which is driven by capacity and market supply for their products. While semiconductor content in communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive and aerospace products continues to increase, the global economic weakness has adversely impacted our customers that operate in those industries. During the recent economic downturn, the demand for our products has been adversely affected by lower profitability of our customers, especially in the memory market, as well as the weak macroeconomic and credit environment and its overall impact on capital spending. Our results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 reflect the impact of the global economic downturn and the resulting contraction in near-term demand for semiconductor and nanoelectronic manufacturing equipment. Several of our customers have reduced their expenditures for production equipment in response to declining sales of their end products and resulting reductions in the utilization of existing manufacturing capacity. Although some customers continue to invest in equipment that is critical to technology development, capacity-related purchases have dropped to historically low levels. This decline was also a result of difficulty experienced by some customers in obtaining financing for their capital expenditure plans. We expect demand for semiconductor capital equipment to continue to remain weak until macroeconomic conditions improve. We cannot predict the severity or duration of the global economic downturn, or the resulting impact on our customer base or on our customers’ manufacturing strategies. However, as long as such conditions persist, we expect that our product order levels and revenues will remain depressed. We have taken significant steps to reduce our production levels and operating cost structure in alignment with expected near-term order and revenue levels. We have lowered our production volumes in response to anticipated near-term business levels in an effort to size our operations to expected demand levels. However, our reduced scale of operations has led to increased inventory-related charges (as our manufacturing inventory 41 Table of Contents requirements decline) and reduced manufacturing capacity utilization, which has adversely impacted our results of operations. Declines in factory utilization by our customers have also resulted in lower service revenue levels and additional inventory-related charges (due to the related decline in customer usage of our systems). During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we announced global workforce reductions and other cost-reduction efforts aimed at lowering our operating expenses in response to the demand environment, and we continue to evaluate further cost-reduction activities as well as the need to further adjust production levels in the event that business conditions deteriorate further. These activities, if implemented, will result in additional near-term charges. However, we believe that our cost-reduction efforts, combined with our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute, will enable us to strengthen our relative competitive position in the current difficult business environment, and will put us in position to take advantage of long-term growth opportunities when favorable business conditions emerge. We continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we completed the acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems Corporation NV. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Microelectronic Inspection Equipment business unit (“MIE business unit”) of Vistec Semiconductor Systems. The acquired MIE business unit is a provider of mask registration measurement tools, SEM-based tools for mask critical dimension measurement and macro defect inspection systems. The results of operations of the MIE business unit are included in the following table from the date of the acquisition on September 30, 2008. The following table sets forth some of our key quarterly unaudited financial information: (In thousands, except per share data) FirstquarterendedSeptember 30,2008 SecondquarterendedDecember 31,2008 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2009 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2009 Total revenues $ 532,513 $ 396,589 $ 309,612 $ 281,502 Total costs and operating expenses $ 497,575 $ 902,220 $ 381,893 $ 316,469 Income (loss) from operations $ 34,938 $ (505,631 ) $ (72,281 ) $ (34,967 ) Net income (loss) $ 19,289 $ (434,254 ) $ (82,827 ) $ (25,576 ) Net income (loss) per share: Basic(1) $ 0.11 $ (2.57 ) $ (0.49 ) $ (0.15 ) Diluted(1) $ 0.11 $ (2.57 ) $ (0.49 ) $ (0.15 ) (In thousands, except per share data) FirstquarterendedSeptember 30,2007 SecondquarterendedDecember 31,2007 ThirdquarterendedMarch 31,2008 FourthquarterendedJune 30,2008 Total revenues $ 693,020 $ 635,783 $ 602,219 $ 590,694 Total costs and operating expenses $ 515,742 $ 542,296 $ 477,019 $ 487,283 Income from operations $ 177,278 $ 93,487 $ 125,200 $ 103,411 Net income $ 88,158 $ 83,935 $ 110,980 $ 76,010 Net income per share: Basic(1) $ 0.47 $ 0.46 $ 0.62 $ 0.43 Diluted(1) $ 0.46 $ 0.45 $ 0.61 $ 0.43 (1) Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented based on the weighted average basic and fully diluted shares outstanding for each quarter. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share. 42 Table of Contents Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 FY09 vs. FY08 FY08 vs. FY07 Revenues: Product $ 1,062,126 $ 2,030,224 $ 2,308,942 $ (968,098 ) -47 % $ (278,718 ) -12 % Service 458,090 491,492 422,287 (33,402 ) -7 % 69,205 16 % Total revenues $ 1,520,216 $ 2,521,716 $ 2,731,229 $ (1,001,500 ) $ (209,513 ) Costs of revenues $ 864,824 $ 1,134,856 $ 1,189,601 $ (270,032 ) -24 % $ (54,745 ) -5 % Stock-based compensation expense included in costs of revenues $ 19,932 $ 22,041 $ 29,183 $ (2,109 ) -10 % $ (7,142 ) -24 % Gross margin percentage 43 % 55 % 56 % -12 % -1 % Product revenues Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as a result of a reduction in capital spending by our customers due to the recent weakness in the semiconductor industry and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, which have resulted in customers delaying their purchases and installations of our products. The decline in revenues reflects the slowdown in worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment, as semiconductor manufacturers reduce capital spending and conserve cash in response to their business environment, even as their need for more precise diagnostics capabilities increases with technological advances. The weak macroeconomic and credit environments have adversely impacted the profitability of our customers, their access to capital and their capital spending and are likely to result in product revenues in the near term that are lower than our revenue levels in comparable periods during prior fiscal years. Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as many of our customers, primarily in the memory markets, scaled back on their capacity investments as the market for their products weakened. In addition, as the macroeconomic environment deteriorated towards the end of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, semiconductor companies reduced their capital spending, which resulted in lower revenues for our products compared to those for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two customers, Intel Corporation and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two customers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Intel Corporation, accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. Service revenues Service revenues are generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems. Service revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as customers idled their under-utilized production equipment in response to the recent weakness in the semiconductor industry and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. Service revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow. 43 Table of Contents Revenues by region Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands): Year ended June 30, 2009 2008 2007 United States $ 372,887 24 % $ 518,851 21 % $ 647,813 24 % Europe & Israel 162,665 11 % 305,350 12 % 271,814 10 % Japan 437,081 29 % 617,214 24 % 600,861 22 % Taiwan 181,411 12 % 570,904 23 % 559,083 20 % Korea 187,624 12 % 225,119 9 % 288,756 11 % Asia Pacific 178,548 12 % 284,278 11 % 362,902 13 % Total $ 1,520,216 100 % $ 2,521,716 100 % $ 2,731,229 100 % A significant portion of our revenues continue to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that will continue to be the case. Gross margin Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product and revenue mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. Our gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 due to lower product and service revenues, higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit, decreased manufacturing capacity utilization, and excess inventory write-downs, which were partially offset by lower employee-related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken. The following are costs that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: • $290.9 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $375.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $85.6 million charge for excess inventory write-downs, compared to $42.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and • $48.2 million for amortization of intangibles, compared to $30.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in gross margin during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was primarily due to $21.4 million of inventory write-downs related to disposal of service inventory as well as discontinued products in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The following are costs that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: • $375.2 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $396.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and • $30.3 million for amortization of intangibles, compared to $33.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. 44 Table of Contents Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 FY09 vs. FY08 FY08 vs. FY07 R&D expenses $ 371,463 $ 409,973 $ 427,515 $ (38,510 ) -9 % $ (17,542 ) -4 % Stock-based compensation expense included in R&D expenses $ 33,127 $ 32,623 $ 42,431 $ 504 2 % $ (9,808 ) -23 % R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues 24 % 16 % 16 % 8 % 0 % R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to reduced employee-related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken, as well as reduced engineering material costs due to a reduced number of projects during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. These decreases were partially offset by additional R&D spending as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: • $220.8 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $226.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $97.9 million for engineering material costs, compared to $112.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $31.6 million for outside services such as consulting and legal, compared to $36.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $31.1 million for depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangibles and expensed in-process R&D (“IPR&D”), compared to $47.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and • $21.7 million of benefit to R&D expense from external funding, compared to $20.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to lower stock-based compensation expense due to our transition from granting stock options to our employees to granting restricted stock units, which carry with them lower stock-based compensation expense. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: • $226.5 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $254.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, • $112.7 million for engineering material costs, compared to $104.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, • $36.8 million for outside services such as consulting and legal, compared to $33.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and • $20.4 million of benefit to R&D expense from external funding, compared to $12.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we expensed IPR&D of $8.6 million, $22.7 million and $16.6 million, respectively, upon the completion of the acquisitions during the applicable fiscal year in connection with acquired intellectual property for which, as of the acquisition date, technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each 45 Table of Contents project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting, and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we determined that we would not pursue future development of certain patents initially licensed to us during fiscal year 2006 for approximately $14.0 million. Since we did not have any alternative use for these patents and we believe the fair value to be $0, the carrying value of $10.7 million was written off. The write-off was recorded as $10.0 million to R&D expense and $0.7 million to costs of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. R&D expenses include the benefit of $21.7 million, $20.4 million and $12.7 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase with increases in our business activity levels as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 FY09 vs. FY08 FY08 vs. FY07 SG&A expenses $ 415,126 $ 464,890 $ 513,525 $ (49,764 ) -11 % $ (48,635 ) -9 % Stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses $ 52,476 $ 51,806 $ 37,164 $ 670 1 % $ 14,642 39 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 27 % 18 % 19 % 9 % -1 % SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to lower expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices and reduced employee-related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken, which are partially offset by additional SG&A spending and higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit, additional bad debt expense and lower gain on sale of real estate assets. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: • $328.0 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $378.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $23.2 million for bad debt expense, compared to $0.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $59.2 million for depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles, compared to $34.3 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, 46 Table of Contents • $13.9 million for expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices, compared to $76.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and • $4.1 million in net gains recorded on the sale of real estate assets, compared to $20.1 million recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease in SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily attributable to gains recognized on sale of our certain real estate assets, lower severance and benefits related to employee workforce reductions, lower stock-based compensation expense and improvements in our operational efficiency. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007: • $378.2 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $408.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, • $76.9 million for expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices, compared to $14.7 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, • $1.9 million for fixed asset impairment charges, compared to $56.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, and • $20.1 million in net gains recorded on the sale of real estate assets, compared to no such gain recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. In November 2006, as part of our long-term business plan, we decided to sell certain real estate properties that we owned in San Jose, California and Livermore, California. Based on the valuation of these assets, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $56.8 million, which has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. See Note 18, “Sale and Impairment of Real Estate Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. On October 16, 2006, following the Special Committee investigation of our historical stock option practices, we terminated all aspects of our employment relationship and agreement with Kenneth L. Schroeder, who ceased to be our Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2006 and had thereafter been employed as a Senior Advisor. As a result, vesting of Mr. Schroeder’s then outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards immediately ceased, and the 0.9 million unvested option shares and 0.1 million unvested restricted stock award shares held by Mr. Schroeder at the time of termination were canceled. Accordingly, in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we reversed $20.3 million of the non-cash, stock-based compensation charges in accordance with paragraphs 19 and 43 of SFAS No. 123(R), because Mr. Schroeder would no longer be able to fulfill his service obligations. The $20.3 million reversal related to the charges that had been recorded in prior periods related to unvested option shares and restricted stock award shares. In December 2006, we canceled 0.6 million vested option shares held by Mr. Schroeder as of the time of termination, representing those shares that had been retroactively priced or otherwise improperly granted. In accordance with paragraph 57 of SFAS No. 123(R), previously recognized stock-based compensation expense related to these awards was not reversed upon cancellation. Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets For the three months ended December 31, 2008, we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit and concluded that the carrying value of our Metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result of the global economic downturn, reductions to our revenue and operating forecasts, and a significant reduction in our market capitalization, we determined that the goodwill related to our Metrology reporting unit was fully impaired. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $272.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2008. 47 Table of Contents As a result of the aforementioned impairment indicators and in accordance with SFAS No. 144, we also performed an analysis utilizing discounted future cash flows related to the long-lived and intangible assets to determine the fair value of each of our asset groups. Based on the assessment, we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $162.8 million related to existing technology, patents, customer relationships and trademarks, as well as an additional $2.0 million related to long-lived assets, during the three months ended December 31, 2008. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill or purchased intangible assets subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Restructuring Charges In March 2009, we announced a plan to further reduce our global workforce by approximately 10%, which followed our announcement in November 2008 of a global workforce reduction of approximately 15%. We are undertaking a number of cost reduction activities, including these workforce reductions, in an effort to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate in response to the current demand environment. The program in the United States is accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits—an amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statements No. 5 and 43, whereas the programs in our international locations are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We expect to recognize significant cost savings from a number of activities we have recently undertaken, including estimated annual cost savings of approximately $130 million as a result of the November 2008 and March 2009 workforce reductions. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we recorded a $38.7 million net restructuring charge, of which $15.9 million was recorded to costs of revenues, $8.6 million to engineering, research and development expense and $14.2 million to selling, general and administrative expense. These charges represent the estimated minimum liability associated with expected termination benefits to be provided to employees. In addition, we are currently in the process of evaluating additional restructuring activities which, if implemented, may result in additional restructuring charges. The following table shows the activity primarily related to severance and benefits expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009: (In thousands) Year endedJune 30, 2009 Beginning Balance $ 1,333 Restructuring costs 40,596 Adjustments (1,912 ) Cash payments (31,931 ) Ending Balance $ 8,086 Substantially all of the restructuring charges related to our workforce reductions announced in November 2008 and March 2009 are expected to be paid out during the calendar year ending December 31, 2009. Interest Income and Other, Net Year ended June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income and other, net $ 30,749 $ 71,625 $ 90,148 Interest expense $ 55,339 $ 10,767 $ 2,781 Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues 2 % 3 % 3 % Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues 4 % 0 % 0 % 48 Table of Contents Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as gains or losses recorded upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The decrease in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was primarily due to lower interest income from our investment and cash portfolio as well as lower foreign currency transaction gain. The decrease in interest income and other, net in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 is primarily due to the lower interest income earned on lower average cash balances during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The increases in interest expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as well as for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 were primarily due to additional interest expense as a result of the issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax provision was 13.1%, 35.9% and 22.2% in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 included the effect of $276.6 million of goodwill impairment charges, which are non-deductible for tax purposes. In addition, we recognized an expense of $38.1 million related to the effect of the New California Budget Legislation signed on February 20, 2009, which will allow for a taxpayer to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to make the election to use the alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. The expense included a reduction in non-current deferred tax assets of $9.7 million and a $28.4 million valuation allowance on excess California research and development credits that we believe will not be utilized due to the effect of the lower apportionment rate. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 included $52.9 million of incremental U.S. tax expense associated with the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy. The incremental U.S. tax expense was a result of an inter-company licensing agreement related to the migration of manufacturing to Singapore. That increase in our U.S. tax expense was partially offset by a benefit of $14.4 million that we recognized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 resulting from revising the amount of prior year cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 included a reduction in tax expense of $15.3 million resulting from the reduction in tax reserves primarily due to the resolution of an examination by the State of California for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 to June 30, 1999, receipt by the Company of a federal tax refund for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, and the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation’s confirmation of the Internal Revenue Service’s audit findings related to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, R&D tax credits, state taxes and tax audit settlements. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non tax-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. Windfall tax benefits arise when a company’s tax deductions for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to 49 Table of Contents capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes. At June 30, 2009, we had cumulative windfalls in excess of shortfalls of approximately $6.0 million recorded as part of capital in excess of par value. In our fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, we expect cumulative shortfalls will begin to exceed cumulative windfalls since the adoption date of SFAS No. 123, and we will therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result. Because we can not determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, (dollar amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 524,967 $ 1,128,106 $ 722,511 Marketable securities 804,917 451,277 988,118 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,329,884 $ 1,579,383 $ 1,710,629 Percentage of total assets 37 % 33 % 37 % Year ended June 30, (In thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 195,684 $ 662,611 $ 598,050 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (484,900 ) 58,063 (386,632 ) Net cash used in financing activities (299,117 ) (318,938 ) (633,227 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (14,806 ) 3,859 15,129 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (603,139 ) $ 405,595 $ (406,680 ) At June 30, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.3 billion, a decrease of $249.5 million from June 30, 2008. We generated $195.7 million in cash from operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. We used $484.9 million in cash for investing activities and an additional $299.1 million for financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $195.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 consisted primarily of net loss of $523.4 million, offset by goodwill, purchased intangible asset and long-lived asset impairment charges of $452.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $135.8 million, non-cash stock-based compensation of $105.5 million, a decrease in inventories of $120.2 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $277.3 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. These increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $432.5 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Cash provided by operating activities was $662.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 consisted primarily of net income of $359.1 million, increased by depreciation and amortization of $126.4 million, non-cash stock-based compensation of $106.5 million, a decrease in inventories of $100.2 million due to lower build plan as a result of lower bookings, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $149.3 million as collections exceeded shipments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. These increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $183.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. 50 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 consisted primarily of net income of $528.1 million increased by depreciation and amortization of $109.3 million, non-cash stock-based compensation of $99.6 million and non-cash impairment charges of $67.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $107.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $45.6 million, and changes in other assets and liabilities of $32.8 million. Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long-term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new markets or emerging technologies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we paid $141.4 million for acquisition of the MIE business unit completed during the fiscal year. Also, sales of certain real estate assets during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 generated $21.8 million, which was offset by capital expenditures of $22.2 million. Financing activities include dividend payments to our common stockholders and sales and repurchases of our common stock. Issuances of common stock (net of applicable tax withholding payment) provided $27.9 million, $155.6 million and $263.2 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We used $226.5 million, $1,111.2 million and $808.5 million in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we announced plans to reduce our global workforce by approximately 15% and 10% in November 2008 and March 2009, respectively. We expect to recognize estimated annual cost savings of $130 million as a result of these reductions in workforce. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we recorded a $38.7 million net restructuring charge, of which $31.9 million was paid out as of June 30, 2009, and the remaining balance is expected to be paid out by the end of calendar year 2009. We anticipate incurring additional severance costs and other related expense in connection with the workforce reductions at least through the remainder of calendar year 2009. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $102.1 million, $108.5 million and $95.1 million, respectively. In February 2007, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program with a third-party investment bank and prepaid $750.0 million to repurchase our common stock. The purchase price per share of the common stock repurchased through the ASR was determined and adjusted based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during a period following the execution of the ASR agreement, subject to a maximum price per share. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our common stock under the ASR, of which 2.0 million shares were delivered to us in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007. The shares repurchased under the ASR decreased our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. This decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In October 2008, we suspended our stock repurchase program. 51 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2009: Fiscal year ending June 30, (In thousands) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Other Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 750,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 750,000 — Interest expense associated with long-term debt obligations 457,125 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 198,375 — Purchase commitments 74,416 69,742 2,595 984 553 542 — — Non-current income tax payable(2) 49,738 — — — — — — 49,738 Operating leases 34,230 11,024 6,398 4,473 3,503 2,469 6,363 — Pension obligations 17,565 1,258 1,549 1,489 1,455 1,765 10,049 — Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,383,074 $ 133,774 $ 62,292 $ 58,696 $ 57,261 $ 56,526 $ 964,787 $ 49,738 (1) In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018. (2) Represents the non-current income tax payable obligation under FIN 48. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods. The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Year ended June 30, (In thousands) 2009 2008 2007 Receivables sold under factoring agreements $ 262,998 $ 290,250 $ 278,560 Proceeds from sales of LCs $ 27,799 $ 39,379 $ 61,850 Discounting fees paid on sales of LCs(1) $ 145 $ 232 $ 804 (1) Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest income and other, net. We maintain guarantee arrangements of $29.1 million in various locations to fund customs guarantees for VAT and LC needs of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. Approximately $18.9 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2009. We maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitments as of June 30, 2009 to be approximately $74.4 million, most of which is due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties. 52 Table of Contents We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Working capital decreased to $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2009, compared to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2008. This decrease is primarily due to cash payments for the share repurchase program, cash payments of dividends to stockholders and an acquisition in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 offset by cash generated from operations. As of June 30, 2009, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities, which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years. They are typically issued in the form of municipal bonds, preferred stock, a pool of student loans, or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset. The reset typically occurs every seven to forty-nine days, through an auction process. At the end of each reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par. The auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are collateralized, insured and guaranteed by the United States Federal Department of Education. In addition, all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either AAA or Aaa. In February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $48.2 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities that we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. These failures are not believed to be a credit issue, but rather caused by a lack of liquidity. The funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. Prior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, a total of $4.8 million of the auction rate securities with a net book value of $4.6 million were called at par by the issuer; therefore, no losses were recognized on these securities. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, an additional $2.8 million of the auction rate securities were called at par by the issuer; therefore, no losses were recognized on these securities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The fair value of our auction rate securities at June 30, 2009 was $38.2 million, which is included in marketable securities under current assets, as our intention is to exercise our right with UBS AG (“UBS”) to sell these auction rate securities at par value at the earliest date possible, which is June 30, 2010. By letter dated August 8, 2008, we received notification from UBS, in connection with a settlement entered into between UBS and certain regulatory agencies, offering to repurchase all of our auction rate security holdings at par value. We formally accepted the settlement offer and entered into a repurchase agreement (“Agreement”) with UBS on November 11, 2008 (“Acceptance Date”). By accepting the Agreement, we (1) received the right (“Put Option”) to sell our auction rate securities at par value to UBS between June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2012 and (2) gave UBS the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after the Acceptance Date as long as we receive the par value. We expect to sell the auction rate securities under the Put Option. However, if the Put Option is not exercised before June 30, 2012, it will expire, and UBS will have no further rights or obligation to buy the auction rate securities. 53 Table of Contents UBS’s obligations under the Put Option are not secured by its assets and do not require UBS to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the Put Option. UBS has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the Put Option. The Agreement covers $40.7 million par value (fair value of $38.2 million) of the auction rate securities held by us as of June 30, 2009. We are accounting for the Put Option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option of SFAS No. 159 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. As a result, $2.4 million was recorded as an increase to interest income and other, net for the fair value of the Put Option during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The fair value of the Put Option at June 30, 2009 was $2.4 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, we made an election pursuant to SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, to transfer these auction rate securities from available-for-sale to trading securities. The transfer to trading securities reflects our intent to exercise the Put Option during the period June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012. Prior to entering into the Agreement, our intent was to hold the auction rate securities until the market recovered. At the time of transfer, the unrealized loss on the auction rate securities was $1.3 million. Prior to the transfer, this unrealized loss had been included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Upon transfer of the auction rate securities to trading securities during the three months ended December 31, 2008, we immediately recognized an unrealized loss of $1.3 million, included in interest income and other, net, for the amount of the unrealized loss not previously recognized in earnings. Subsequently, we recognized an additional decline in fair value of $5.4 million for a total unrealized loss of $6.7 million, included in interest income and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 31, 2008. During the three months ended March 31, 2009, we recognized an increase in the fair value of the auction rate securities of $4.9 million, which is included in interest income and other, net. During the three months ended June 30, 2009, we recognized a decrease in the fair value of the auction rate securities of $0.7 million, which is included in interest income and other, net. We expect that the future changes in the fair value of the Put Option will continue to be largely offset by the fair value movements in the auction rate securities. We estimated the fair value of the auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value. Some of these assumptions include estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the auction rate securities. We estimated the fair value of the Put Option using the expected value that we will receive from UBS, which was calculated as the difference between the anticipated recognized losses and par value of the auction rate securities as of the option exercise date. This value was discounted by using UBS’s credit default swap rate to account for the credit considerations of the counterparty risk. We will reassess the fair value in future reporting periods based on several factors, including continued failure of auctions, failure of investments to be redeemed, deterioration of credit ratings of investments, market risk and other factors. Based on our expected operating cash flows and other sources of cash, we do not believe that any reduction in liquidity of our auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior, unsecured long-term debt due in 2018 with an effective interest rate of 7.00%. The discount on the debt amounted to $5.4 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-line method as opposed to the interest method due to immateriality. Interest is payable semi-annually on November 1 and May 1. The debt indenture includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. We are in compliance with all of our covenants as at June 30, 2009. 54 Table of Contents Our credit ratings and outlooks as of July 23, 2009 are summarized below. Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch BBB Negative Moody’s Baa1 Stable Standard & Poor’s BBB Negative Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 13 months, were as follows: As of June 30, (In thousands) 2009 2008 Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase $ — $ 7,413 Sell (36,938 ) (200,676 ) Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase 73,914 1,278,395 Sell (106,080 ) (1,402,119 ) Net $ (69,104 ) $ (316,987 ) 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2009. Actual results may differ materially. As of June 30, 2009, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $804.9 million, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2009, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $2.0 million. See Note 4, “Marketable Securities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements; Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”; and Item 1A, “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at June 30, 2009. As of June 30, 2009, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $69.1 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2009, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $69.7 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $17.5 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows. In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. At June 30, 2009, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $745.2 million and $702.0 million, respectively. At June 30, 2008, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $744.7 million and $728.9 million, respectively. 56 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:47.525701
319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company’s related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to written acceptance from the customer, as follows: • When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. • When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation. • When the customer fab has already accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation. • When the customer withholds signature on our acceptance document due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications. • When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer. Total revenue recognized without a written acceptance from the customer was approximately 24%, 14% and 16% of total revenues for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was primarily driven by higher shipments of the same tools with same specifications that have previously been accepted at the applicable customer fabs. The decrease in revenue recognized without a written acceptance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was 34 Table of Contents primarily driven by lower shipments of tools that had already met the required acceptance criteria at those customer fabs. Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in costs of revenues. Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. Services performed in the absence of a contract, such as consulting and training revenue, are recognized when the related services are performed, and collectibility is reasonably assured. The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which has not met the revenue recognition criteria of the Company. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Revenue Recognition for Certain Arrangements with Software Elements and/or Multiple Deliverables. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the product’s essential functionality from the scope of industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance. In October 2009, the FASB also amended the accounting standards for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to: • provide updated guidance on how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and how the consideration should be allocated; • eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method; and • require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices (“ESP”) of deliverables if it does not have vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) or third-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price. Valuation terms are defined as follows: • VSOE—the price at which we sell the element in a separate stand-alone transaction. • TPE—evidence from us or other companies of the value of a largely interchangeable element in a transaction. • ESP—our best estimate of the selling price of an element in a transaction. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our second quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010 and have applied the adoption retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year to apply the guidance to transactions originating or materially modified after June 30, 2009. The implementation resulted in additional qualitative disclosures that are included in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements but did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 35 Table of Contents For transactions entered into through June 30, 2009, we primarily recognized revenue based on the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104. During the period, for the majority of our arrangements involving multiple deliverables, the entire amount of the sales contract was allocated to each respective element based on its relative selling price, using fair value. In the limited circumstances when we were not able to determine fair value for the deliverables in the arrangement, but were able to obtain fair value for the undelivered elements, revenue was allocated using the residual method. Under the residual method, the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate selling price of any undelivered elements, and no revenue was recognized until all elements without fair value had been delivered. If fair value of any undelivered elements did not exist, the entire amount of the sales contract was deferred until all elements were accepted by the customer. Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost, and written down to their net realizable value. We review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on past usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values. Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for stock options and for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black-Scholes 36 Table of Contents option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock. Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance that requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance was necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. 37 Table of Contents Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment. Fair Value Measurements. We adopted authoritative guidance for fair value measurements as of the beginning of fiscal year 2009. In February 2008, the FASB issued a provision that allowed companies to elect a one-year delay in applying the fair value measurements guidance to certain fair value measurements, primarily related to non-financial assets and liabilities. We elected the delayed adoption date for our non-financial assets and liabilities impacted by the guidance. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The adoption of the guidance relating to the fair value measurement of non-financial assets and liabilities on July 1, 2009 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Concurrently with the adoption of the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions, we adopted authoritative guidance that permits entities to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. See Note 2, “Fair Value Measurements,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In April 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on share-based payment awards denominated in certain currencies. The amendment clarifies that an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. This amendment becomes effective for our interim period ending September 30, 2011. We do not expect the implementation to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2010, the FASB amended the authoritative guidance addressing accounting for arrangements in which a vendor satisfies its performance obligations over time, with all or a portion of the consideration contingent on future events, referred to as “milestones.” The scope of the new guidance is limited to milestones in arrangements that involve research or development activities, such as the successful completion of a drug study phase. The amendment provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate. A vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive. A vendor that is affected by the amendments is required to provide a description of the overall arrangement, a description of each milestone and related contingent consideration, a determination of whether each milestone is considered substantive, the factors that 38 Table of Contents the entity considered in determining whether the milestone or milestones are substantive, and the amount of consideration recognized during the period for the milestone or milestones. This amendment becomes effective for our interim period ending September 30, 2010, and we do not expect the amendment to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2010, the FASB amended the authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging. The amendment addresses the scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives to clarify when analysis of an embedded credit derivative for bifurcation from the host contract is not required. It specifies that embedded credit derivatives not qualifying for the scope exception, such as an embedded derivative related to a credit default swap on a referenced credit, would be subject to a bifurcation analysis even if their effects are allocated to interests in subordinated tranches of securitized financial instruments. The amended guidance requires that an entity separately disclose, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, the gross gains and gross losses that comprise the cumulative-effect adjustment that results from adopting the amended guidance. The amended guidance becomes effective for our interim period ending September 30, 2010. We currently do not hold such derivatives, and do not expect the amendment to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2010, the SEC issued a policy statement and staff work plan regarding the potential use by U.S. issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board. Under the proposed timeline set forth by the SEC, we could be required in fiscal year 2015 to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and the SEC is expected to make a determination in 2011 regarding the mandatory adoption of IFRS. We are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial statements, and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of IFRS. In February 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on subsequent events. The amendment states that entities that are required to file or furnish their financial statements with the SEC are no longer required to disclose the date through which the entity has evaluated subsequent events. This amendment was effective for our interim reporting period ended March 31, 2010, and the implementation did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature. In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. This guidance now requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance for Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements was effective for our interim reporting period ended March 31, 2010. The implementation did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature. The guidance for Level 3 fair value measurements disclosures becomes effective for our interim reporting period ending September 30, 2011, and we do not expect that this guidance will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature. In October 2009, the FASB amended its Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) authoritative guidance addressing revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance requires revenue to be allocated to multiple elements using relative fair value based on vendor-specific objective evidence, third-party evidence or estimated selling price. The residual method also becomes obsolete under this guidance. This guidance is effective for our interim reporting period ending September 30, 2010, and allows for early adoption. We elected to early adopt the accounting guidance at the beginning of the second quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2010 and have applied the adoption retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year to apply the guidance to transactions originating or materially modified after June 30, 2009. The implementation resulted in additional qualitative disclosures but did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 39 Table of Contents In October 2009, the FASB amended the authoritative guidance addressing certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This guidance states that tangible products with hardware and software components that work together to deliver the product functionality are considered non-software products, and the accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables is to be followed with respect to such products. This guidance is effective for our interim reporting period ending September 30, 2010, and allows for early adoption. We elected to early adopt the accounting guidance at the beginning of the second quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2010 and have applied the adoption retrospectively to the beginning of the fiscal year to apply the guidance to transactions originating or materially modified after June 30, 2009. The implementation resulted in additional qualitative disclosures but did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In August 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for measuring liabilities at fair value that reaffirms the previously existing definition of fair value and reintroduces the concept of entry value into the determination of fair value of liabilities. Entry value is the amount an entity would receive to enter into an identical liability. The guidance was effective for our interim reporting period ended December 31, 2009. The implementation did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for consolidations that changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting (or similar rights) should be consolidated. The determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on, among other things, an entity’s purpose and design and a company’s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. This guidance was effective for our interim reporting period ending September 30, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to establish the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the source of authoritative accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. This guidance was effective for our interim reporting period ended September 30, 2009 and only impacted references for accounting guidance. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for business combinations that amends the provisions related to the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. This guidance will require such contingencies to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period. Otherwise, entities would typically account for the acquired contingencies in accordance with authoritative guidance for contingencies. The guidance became effective for our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after July 1, 2009. The implementation did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, and the effect of this guidance, if any, on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in future periods will depend on the nature and significance of business combinations subject to this guidance. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to increase the frequency of fair value disclosures of financial instruments, thereby enhancing consistency in financial reporting. The guidance relates to fair value disclosures for any financial instruments that are not currently reflected on a company’s balance sheet at fair value. Prior to the effective date of this guidance, fair values for these types of financial assets and liabilities had only been disclosed once a year. The guidance requires these disclosures on a quarterly basis, providing qualitative and quantitative information about fair value estimates for all those financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value. The disclosure requirement under this guidance was effective for our interim reporting period ended September 30, 2009. The implementation did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature. 40 Table of Contents In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other post-retirement plan. The guidance requires annual disclosures surrounding how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies. The annual disclosure requirement under this guidance was effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2010. The implementation resulted in additional qualitative disclosures, but did not change the accounting treatment for postretirement benefit plans. In April 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for general intangibles other than goodwill, amending the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. This guidance is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after July 1, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 41 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY KLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Within our primary area of focus, our comprehensive portfolio of products, services, software and expertise helps integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process – from research and development to final volume production. In addition to the semiconductor industry, our technologies serve a number of other industries, including the high brightness light emitting diode (“HBLED”), data storage, and photovoltaic industries, as well as general materials research. Our products and services are used by the vast majority of wafer, IC, reticle and disk manufacturers in the world. Our revenues are driven largely by capital spending by our customers who operate in one or more of several key semiconductor markets, including the memory, foundry and logic markets. Our customers purchase our products either in response to the need to drive advances in process technologies or to ramp up production to satisfy demand from industries such as communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive and aerospace. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as reduced cost, which in turn will drive increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity. As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. The industries we serve have historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing capacity. Our ability to predict future capacity-related capital spending by our customers is extremely limited, as such spending is very closely connected to the unpredictable business cycles within their industries. While our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, historically has been, and is becoming increasingly, highly concentrated, we expect capital spending of our customers on process control to increase over the long term, driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address new defects as a result of shrinking device feature sizes, the transition to new materials, new device and circuit architecture, new lithography challenges and fab process innovation. The demand for our products is generally affected by the profitability of our customers, which is driven by capacity and market supply for their products, as well as the willingness and ability of our customers to invest in new technologies. The increase in the semiconductor content in communication, data processing, consumer electronics, automotive and aerospace products, combined with the improving global economic environment during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, favorably impacted our customers and consequently accelerated the demand for our products. As our customers accelerate capital investments, we have started to increase production volumes to support anticipated customer demand. However, we cannot predict the duration and sustainability of the improving business conditions. As we increase production volumes and make commitments to increase our capacity in anticipation of improved business conditions, we remain at risk of incurring inventory-related and other restructuring charges if the recent improved business conditions do not continue. The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Total revenues $ 1,820,760 $ 1,520,216 $ 2,521,716 Costs of revenues $ 815,662 $ 864,824 $ 1,134,856 Gross margin percentage 55 % 43 % 55 % Net income (loss) $ 212,300 $ (523,368 ) $ 359,083 Diluted income (loss) per share $ 1.23 $ (3.07 ) $ 1.95 42 Table of Contents The results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 reflected improved fundamentals in the semiconductor industry driven by improvement in the economic environment, and strong demand from our foundry customers. Sales of our products and demand for our services improved as our customers ramped up their operations in response to improved market conditions. Even as we increased our business activity levels and shipped more products to our customers during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, we maintained tight controls over costs, which resulted in strong gross margins as well as net income. The results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 indicated the weak demand for semiconductor capital equipment and service due to the unfavorable global economic and industry conditions. The macroeconomic uncertainty led our customers to significantly reduce their factory operations and spending. While we took actions to restructure our operations and reduce our cost structure in response to the deteriorating market conditions, the rapid decline in revenues resulted in a significant deterioration in gross margins and a net loss. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Microelectronic Inspection Equipment business unit (“MIE business unit”) of Vistec Semiconductor Systems for net cash consideration of approximately $141.4 million. The acquired MIE business unit is a provider of mask registration measurement tools, Scanning Electron Microscope (“SEM”) based tools for mask critical dimension measurement and macro defect inspection systems. Our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 also included significant charges associated with impairment of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring programs. The results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 reflected the culmination of a period of improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industry recovery in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. While the semiconductor market, and overall economic conditions, had started to weaken throughout the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, our backlog position driven by demand from dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory chip manufacturers enabled us to generate strong revenue, gross margin and net income. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, we completed the acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems Corporation for net cash consideration of approximately $488.8 million primarily to expand our product portfolio in semiconductor packaging inspection and to gain entry into the solar cell inspection and HBLED inspection markets. Revenues and Gross Margin Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 FY10 vs. FY09 FY09 vs. FY08 Revenues: Product $ 1,324,270 $ 1,062,126 $ 2,030,224 $ 262,144 25 % $ (968,098 ) -47 % Service 496,490 458,090 491,492 38,400 8 % (33,402 ) -7 % Total revenues $ 1,820,760 $ 1,520,216 $ 2,521,716 $ 300,544 $ (1,001,500 ) Costs of revenues $ 815,662 $ 864,824 $ 1,134,856 $ (49,162 ) -6 % $ (270,032 ) -24 % Stock-based compensation expense included in costs of revenues $ 14,275 $ 19,932 $ 22,041 $ (5,657 ) -28 % $ (2,109 ) -10 % Gross margin percentage 55 % 43 % 55 % 12 % -12 % Product revenues Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as a result of increased capital spending by customers for both technology and capacity related investments of process control equipment, in response to strong semiconductor electronics end market demand. 43 Table of Contents New semiconductor manufacturing products targeted towards the most advanced production nodes were significant contributors to this increase in revenue, as customers added advanced production capacity, particularly those serving the foundry market. These factors contributed to an increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase in tool sales over our prior fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in our sales of defect inspection equipment. Product revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as a result of a reduction in capital spending by our customers due to the weakness in the semiconductor industry and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, which resulted in customers delaying their purchases and installations of our products. The decline in revenues reflected the slowdown in worldwide demand for semiconductor equipment, as semiconductor manufacturers reduced capital spending and conserved cash in response to their business environment, even as their need for more precise diagnostics capabilities increased with technological advances. The weak macroeconomic and credit environments during the year adversely impacted the profitability of our customers, their access to capital and their capital spending. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, two customers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Intel Corporation, each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, two customers, Intel Corporation and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. As of June 30, 2010, two customers, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, each accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. As of June 30, 2009, two customers, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Intel Corporation, each accounted for more than 10% of net accounts receivable. Service revenues Service revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems. Service revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as the increase in wafer processing activity by semiconductor manufacturing customers drove higher system utilization of our previously installed equipment. This higher utilization level led to an increase in demand for service. Service revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 as customers idled their under-utilized production equipment in response to the weakness in the semiconductor industry and the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. Revenues by region Revenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows (in thousands): Year ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 United States $ 341,079 19 % $ 372,887 24 % $ 518,851 21 % Europe & Israel 111,497 6 % 162,665 11 % 305,350 12 % Japan 239,393 13 % 437,081 29 % 617,214 24 % Taiwan 688,089 38 % 181,411 12 % 570,904 23 % Korea 151,198 8 % 187,624 12 % 225,119 9 % Rest of Asia 289,504 16 % 178,548 12 % 284,278 11 % Total $ 1,820,760 100 % $ 1,520,216 100 % $ 2,521,716 100 % 44 Table of Contents A significant portion of our revenues continue to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that will continue to be the case. Gross margin Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix, and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products. Our gross margin percentage increased to 55% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from 43% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to demand for new high value products, significant volume efficiencies in manufacturing operations worldwide, lower inventory obsolescence, as well as a lower overall manufacturing cost structure as a result of our outsourcing and globalization initiatives. In addition, productivity improvements resulting from better utilization of field service resources contributed to the gross margin improvement. Our gross margin percentage decreased to 43% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from 55% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to lower product and service revenues, higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit, decreased manufacturing capacity utilization, and excess inventory write-downs. Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 FY10 vs. FY09 FY09 vs. FY08 R&D expenses $ 329,560 $ 371,463 $ 409,973 $ (41,903 ) -11 % $ (38,510 ) -9 % Stock-based compensation expense included in R&D expenses $ 27,289 $ 33,127 $ 32,623 $ (5,838 ) -18 % $ 504 2 % R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues 18 % 24 % 16 % -6 % 8 % R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, even as we continued significant investments in product research and development. The decrease during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was primarily attributable to cost reduction activities initiated during fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. In addition, no in-process R&D expense associated with acquisitions that we completed during that year was recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to $8.6 million of in-process R&D expense recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Furthermore, development material costs and consulting services related to R&D product development decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as certain significant new products completed the product development cycle during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and came to market in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009: • $209.6 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $220.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, • $83.8 million for engineering material costs, compared to $97.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, • $26.5 million for outside services such as consulting, compared to $31.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, • $15.6 million for depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangibles and expensed in-process R&D (“IPR&D”), compared to $31.1 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and • $13.7 million of benefit to R&D expense from external funding, compared to $21.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. 45 Table of Contents R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to reduced employee-related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken, as well as reduced engineering material costs during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. These decreases were partially offset by additional R&D spending as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: • $220.8 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $226.5 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $97.9 million for engineering material costs, compared to $112.7 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $31.6 million for outside services such as consulting, compared to $36.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $31.1 million for depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangibles and expensed IPR&D, compared to $47.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and • $21.7 million of benefit to R&D expense from external funding, compared to $20.4 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, we expensed IPR&D of $8.6 million and $22.7 million, respectively, upon the completion of the acquisitions during the applicable fiscal year in connection with acquired intellectual property for which, as of the acquisition date, technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting, and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements. R&D expenses include the benefit of $13.7 million, $21.7 million and $20.4 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase with increases in our business activity levels as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. 46 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 FY10 vs. FY09 FY09 vs. FY08 SG&A expenses $ 361,372 $ 415,126 $ 464,890 $ (53,754 ) -13 % $ (49,764 ) -11 % Stock-based compensation expense included in SG&A expenses $ 44,418 $ 52,476 $ 51,806 $ (8,058 ) -15 % $ 670 1 % SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues 20 % 27 % 18 % -7 % 9 % SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to cost reduction activities initiated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. In addition, $2.9 million of bad debt recovery was recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to $23.2 million of bad debt expense recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009: • $306.7 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $328.0 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, • $2.9 million of bad debt recovery, compared to $23.2 million of bad debt expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, • $48.7 million for depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles, compared to $59.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and • $16.9 million for expenses and settlements, net, related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices, compared to $13.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 primarily due to lower expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices and reduced employee-related expenses as a result of a number of cost reduction activities that we have undertaken, which are partially offset by additional SG&A spending and higher intangible assets amortization expense as a result of our acquisitions of ICOS and the MIE business unit, additional bad debt expense and lower gain on sale of real estate assets. The following are expenses that were recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008: • $328.0 million for employee-related expenses, compared to $378.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $23.2 million for bad debt expense, compared to $0.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $59.2 million for depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles, compared to $34.3 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • $13.9 million for expenses related to the shareholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices, compared to $76.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, and • $4.1 million in net gains recorded on the sale of real estate assets, compared to $20.1 million recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets For the three months ended December 31, 2009, we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, our assessment indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their estimated 47 Table of Contents carrying values, and therefore goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. For the three months ended December 31, 2008, we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit and concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the carrying value of our Metrology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result of the global economic downturn, reductions to our revenue and operating forecasts and a significant reduction in our market capitalization, we determined that the goodwill related to our Metrology reporting unit was fully impaired. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $272.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2008. As a result of the aforementioned impairment indicators for the three months ended December 31, 2008 and in accordance with the authoritative guidance on impairment of long-lived assets, we performed an analysis utilizing discounted future cash flows related to the long-lived and intangible assets to determine the fair value of each of our asset groups. Based on the assessment, we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $162.8 million related to existing technology, patents, customer relationships and trademarks, as well as an additional $2.0 million impairment charge related to long-lived assets during the three months ended December 31, 2008. Restructuring Charges In March 2009, we announced a plan to further reduce our global workforce by approximately 10%, which followed our announcement in November 2008 of a global workforce reduction of approximately 15%. We have undertaken a number of cost reduction activities, including these workforce reductions, in an effort to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate. The program in the United States is accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance related to compensation for nonretirement post-employment benefits, whereas the programs in the international locations are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for contingencies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, we recorded a $4.5 million net restructuring charge, of which $2.2 million was recorded to costs of revenues, $0.4 million to engineering, research and development expense and $1.9 million to selling, general and administrative expense. These charges represent the estimated minimum liability associated with expected termination benefits to be provided to employees. The following table shows the activity primarily related to severance and benefits expense for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009: (In thousands) Year endedJune 30, 2010 Year endedJune 30, 2009 Beginning Balance $ 8,086 $ 1,333 Restructuring costs 5,580 40,596 Adjustments (1,045 ) (1,912 ) Cash payments (12,174 ) (31,931 ) Ending Balance $ 447 $ 8,086 Substantially all of the remaining accrued restructuring balance as of June 30, 2010 related to our workforce reductions is expected to be paid out by the end of calendar year 2010. Interest Income and Other, Net Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Interest income and other, net $ 31,532 $ 30,749 $ 71,625 Interest expense $ 54,517 $ 55,339 $ 10,767 Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues 2 % 2 % 3 % Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues 3 % 4 % 0 % 48 Table of Contents Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, as well as gains or losses recorded upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. Interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 remained flat. The decrease in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was primarily the result of lower interest income from our investment and cash portfolio due to lower market interest rates, as well as lower foreign currency transaction gain. Interest expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 remained flat. The increase in interest expense in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was primarily due to additional interest expense as a result of the issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. Provision for Income Taxes The following table provides details of income taxes: (In thousands) Year ended June 30, 2010 2009 2008 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 291,181 $ (602,531 ) $ 560,234 Provision for (benefit from) taxes 78,881 (79,163 ) 201,151 Effective tax rate 27.1 % 13.1 % 35.9 % Tax expense has decreased during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 due to a year-over-year increase in the proportion of our income earned outside the United States in countries with lower income tax rates. We incurred $12.0 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 due to shortfalls from employee stock activity. Windfall tax benefits arise when a company’s tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes. We incurred $38.1 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 due to a reduction in non-current deferred tax assets as a result of the adoption of California budget legislation, signed on February 20, 2009, which will allow a taxpayer to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to make the election to use the alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. The expense included a reduction in non-current deferred tax assets of $9.7 million and a $28.4 million valuation allowance on excess California research and development credits that we believe will not be utilized due to the effect of the lower apportionment rate. Tax expense was also increased during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 due to a goodwill impairment charge of $277.0 million related to certain business units, which was non-deductible for tax purposes. We incurred $52.9 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 due to the implementation of our global manufacturing strategy. The incremental U.S. tax expense was a result of an inter-company licensing agreement related to the migration of manufacturing to Singapore. The additional tax expense was partially offset by a tax benefit of $14.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2008 that we realized due to the revision of prior year cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. 49 Table of Contents Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2011, cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may continue to exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity, and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result. Because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year. In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. We are under United States federal income tax examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2007 through June 30, 2009, which represents all years for which tax returns have been filed and the statute of limitations has not expired. We are subject to state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006. We are also subject to examinations in major foreign jurisdictions, including Japan, Israel and Singapore, for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and are currently under tax examinations in various other foreign tax jurisdictions. It is possible that certain examinations may be concluded in the next twelve months. We believe it is possible that we may recognize up to $3.6 million of our existing unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months as a result of the lapse of statutes of limitations, and the resolution of agreements with various foreign tax authorities. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 529,918 $ 524,967 $ 1,128,106 Marketable securities 1,004,126 804,917 451,277 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 1,534,044 $ 1,329,884 $ 1,579,383 Percentage of total assets 39 % 37 % 33 % Year ended June 30, (In thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 447,800 $ 195,684 $ 662,611 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (227,964 ) (484,900 ) 58,063 Net cash used in financing activities (216,331 ) (299,117 ) (318,938 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1,446 (14,806 ) 3,859 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,951 $ (603,139 ) $ 405,595 At June 30, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion, an increase of $204 million from June 30, 2009. We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $448 million and $196 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 50 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from $196 million to $448 million primarily as a result of the following key factors: • Lower operating expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, reduced by approximately $165 million as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, resulting primarily from our cost cutting measures initiated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, • No material cash payments in the settlement of litigation during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, as compared to a cash payment of $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 in connection with the settlement of the shareholder class action litigation related to our historical stock option practices, • Increase in customer collections by approximately $58 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and • Increase in taxes paid of approximately $26 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from $485 million to $228 million primarily as a result of the following key factors: • Decrease of $140 million in acquisitions, primarily driven by the acquisition of the MIE business unit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, • Decrease in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $141 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, partially offset by • Decrease in cash collections by approximately $16 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from sale of assets, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from $299 million to $216 million as a result of lower common stock repurchases. We repurchased $136 million of our common stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, as compared to $227 million in stock repurchases during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 from $663 million to $196 million primarily as a result of the following key factors: • Lower customer collections as a result of a decline in revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, reduced by approximately $862 million as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • Decrease of $78 million in interest income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, primarily due to lower market interest rates, • Cash payments of $65 million in the settlement of litigation in connection with the settlement of the shareholder class action litigation related to our historical stock option practices during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as compared to no such payments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • Interest payments of $52 million on the $750 million of our outstanding senior notes during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as compared to no such payments during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, partially offset by • Reduced operating expenses by approximately $346 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, primarily from our cost reduction measures, and • Lower tax payments of $238 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. 51 Table of Contents Cash flow from investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 declined compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 from $58 million of cash provided by investing activities to $485 million of cash used in investing activities, primarily as a result of the following key factors: • Increase in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $884 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, • Decrease in cash collections by approximately $47 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from sale of real estate assets, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, partially offset by • Decrease of $353 million in acquisition expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, primarily driven by our acquisition of ICOS for net cash consideration of approximately $489 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 and our acquisition of the MIE business unit of Vistec Semiconductor Systems for net cash consideration of approximately $141 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and • Lower capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 by approximately $35 million, as compared to the fiscal year ended June 20, 2008. Cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 declined compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 from $319 million to $299 million as a result of lower common stock repurchases, largely offset by cash proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. We repurchased $227 million of our common stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, as compared to $1.1 billion in stock repurchases during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we announced plans to reduce our global workforce by approximately 15% and 10% in November 2008 and March 2009, respectively. We recorded $4.5 million and $38.7 million in net restructuring charges during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of June 30, 2010, we have paid out approximately $44.1 million in restructuring payments. The remaining balance will be paid out by the end of calendar year 2010. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $102.4 million, $102.1 million and $108.5 million, respectively. The shares repurchased under our share repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. The decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In October 2008, we suspended our stock repurchase program, and we subsequently restarted the program in February 2010. Contractual Obligations The following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2010: Fiscal year ending June 30, (In thousands) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Other Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 750,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 750,000 — Interest expense associated with long-term debt obligations 405,375 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 146,625 — Purchase commitments 338,097 334,050 2,700 603 491 253 — — Non-current income tax payable(2) 58,982 — — — — — — 58,982 Operating leases 28,505 8,779 5,848 3,970 2,876 1,849 5,183 — Pension obligations 24,240 1,735 1,572 1,960 1,927 2,541 14,505 — Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,605,199 $ 396,314 $ 61,870 $ 58,283 $ 57,044 $ 56,393 $ 916,313 $ 58,982 52 Table of Contents (1) In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018. (2) Represents the non-current tax payable obligation. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods. The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid during the years ended June 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Year ended June 30, (In thousands) 2010 2009 2008 Receivables sold under factoring agreements $ 107,666 $ 262,998 $ 290,250 Proceeds from sales of LCs $ 37,226 $ 27,799 $ 39,379 Discounting fees paid on sales of LCs(1) $ 189 $ 145 $ 232 (1) Discounting fees were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest income and other, net. We maintain guarantee arrangements of $16.7 million in various locations to fund customs guarantees for VAT and LC needs of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. Approximately $14.4 million was outstanding under these arrangements as of June 30, 2010. We maintain certain purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. We estimate our purchase commitments as of June 30, 2010 to be approximately $338.1 million, most of which is due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may change in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Working capital increased to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2010, compared to $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2009. This increase is primarily due to cash generated from operations, offset by cash payments for the share repurchase program, cash payments of dividends to stockholders, and purchases of fixed assets. As of June 30, 2010, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. 53 Table of Contents Our investment portfolio included auction rate securities, which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years. They are typically issued in the form of municipal bonds, preferred stock, a pool of student loans, or collateralized debt obligations whose interest rates are reset. The reset typically occurs every seven to forty-nine days, through an auction process. At the end of each reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par. The auction rate securities held by us are backed by student loans and are collateralized, insured and guaranteed by the United States Federal Department of Education. In addition, all auction rate securities held by us are rated by the major independent rating agencies as either AAA or Aaa. In February 2008, auctions failed for approximately $48.2 million in par value of municipal auction rate securities that we held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. These failures are not believed to be a credit issue, but rather caused by a lack of liquidity. The funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. By letter dated August 8, 2008, we received notification from UBS AG (“UBS”), in connection with a settlement entered into between UBS and certain regulatory agencies, offering to repurchase all of our auction rate security holdings at par value. We formally accepted the settlement offer and entered into a repurchase agreement (“Agreement”) with UBS on November 11, 2008 (“Acceptance Date”). By accepting the Agreement, we (1) received the right (“Put Option”) to sell our auction rate securities at par value to UBS between June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2012 and (2) gave UBS the right to purchase the auction rate securities from us any time after the Acceptance Date as long as we receive the par value. As of June 30, 2009, we had $40.7 million par value of auction rate securities. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, $23.9 million of the auction rate securities were called at par by the issuers. The Put Option was exercised on June 30, 2010 to sell the remaining auction rate securities of $16.8 million at par value and was subsequently settled. As of June 30, 2010, those remaining auction rate securities that had been sold but had not yet been settled as of such date are included in marketable securities and valued at par. We accounted for the Put Option as a freestanding financial instrument, and during the three months ended December 31, 2008, we made an election to transfer these auction rate securities from available for sale to trading securities. In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior, unsecured long-term debt due in 2018 with an effective interest rate of 7.00%. The discount on the debt amounted to $5.4 million and is being amortized over the life of the debt using the straight-line method as opposed to the interest method due to immateriality. Interest is payable semi-annually on November 1 and May 1. The debt indenture includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted. We are in compliance with all of our covenants as at June 30, 2010. Our credit ratings and outlooks as of July 22, 2010 are summarized below. Rating Agency Rating Outlook Fitch BBB Stable Moody’s Baa1 Stable Standard & Poor’s BBB Negative Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Under our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management 54 Table of Contents program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 18 months, were as follows: As of June 30, (In thousands) 2010 2009 Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase $ 15,835 $ — Sell (32,853 ) (36,938 ) Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase 82,535 73,914 Sell (104,414 ) (106,080 ) Net $ (38,897 ) $ (69,104 ) 55 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2010. Actual results may differ materially. As of June 30, 2010, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.0 billion, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2010, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $1.3 million. As of June 30, 2010, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $38.9 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2010, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $44.4 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $21.5 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows. In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. At June 30, 2010, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $745.7 million and $834.4 million, respectively. At June 30, 2009, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $745.2 million and $702.0 million, respectively. 56 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:54:49.228071

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We based these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis, and the audit committee has reviewed the Company’s disclosure relating to them in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sale price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred or services rendered, and collectibility is reasonably assured. System revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the product. We generally recognize system revenue upon positive affirmation by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to pre-determined specifications. This positive affirmation is generally evidenced by an acceptance document signed by the customer. This change has the impact of prolonging the cycle time between order placement and revenue recognition. In limited cases, we allow for exceptions where we recognize system revenue upon shipment; these exceptions have accounted for approximately 4.9%, 3.1% and 2.5% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in revenue exceptions results from multiple shipments of same tools that have already met the required acceptance criteria, to customers who are looking to expand capacity. (See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under “Revenue Recognition” for detailed description of exceptions.) Shipping charges billed to customers are included in system revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of revenues. Revenue from software license fees is typically recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement. 26 Such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services and/or upgrades. If vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, all revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist, or until all elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. In instances where an arrangement to deliver software requires significant modification or customization, license fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting. Allowances are established for potential product returns and credit losses. Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Service and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement, which includes a software license agreement, amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence. Consulting and training revenue is recognized when the related services are performed. The deferred system profit balance as of June 30, 2004 was $285 million. This amount equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment less applicable product and warranty costs. The deferred profit balance increased from $177 million at June 30, 2003 primarily because shipments were higher than customer acceptance for which revenue was recognized during fiscal year 2004. We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. The unearned revenue balance increased to $57 million at June 30, 2004 from $48 million at June 30, 2003 primarily due to an increase in service contracts as our installed base of equipment at customers’ sites continues to increase. Inventory Reserves We review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis. For production inventory, our methodology involves matching our on-hand and on-order inventory with our build forecast over the next twelve months. We then evaluate the parts found to be in excess of the twelve-month demand and take appropriate reserves to reflect the risk of obsolescence. For spare parts inventory, we match our on-hand inventory against twenty-four months of usage. We then evaluate the parts in excess of the twenty-four month usage and take appropriate reserves to reflect risk of obsolescence. Both methodologies are significantly affected by the usage assumption. The longer the time period of estimated usage, the lower the reserves are required. Based on our past experience, we believe the twelve-month/twenty-four month time periods best reflect the reasonable and relative obsolescence risks. If actual demand or usage were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inventory reserves, once established, are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. 27 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of all accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, and the financial condition of our customers were adversely affected resulting in their inability to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income. Warranty We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges every quarter. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty reserves accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions for which there is limited or no historical product performance on which to base the estimated warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is deferred as unearned revenue and is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences. Contingencies and Litigation We are currently named as a party to various legal proceedings, including those disclosed in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we currently believe the ultimate outcome of this proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. We would accrue the cost of an adverse judgment if, in our estimation, the adverse settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the ultimate cost to us. We have made no such accruals as of June 30, 2004. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” (SFAS 109) which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover all of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable. 28 On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY New system and service orders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 were 74% higher than the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. The growth in orders is being driven by the need of our customers to expand both 200-mm and 300-mm capacity, advance existing capacity to next-generation processes, increase the efficiency of already operating production lines and overcome yield and reliability problems in next-generation pilot lines. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 new system and service orders were 7% lower than the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002 due to the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 our total revenues increased approximately 13% over fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, driven by increased customer demands. While our service revenue continues to grow in absolute dollar terms, most of the growth is being driven by increases in product revenues. Total revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 were approximately 19% lower than the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. This was primarily due to a decline in customer demand for our products as a result of the downturn in the semiconductor industry. Gross margins for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 improved 6% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. The main reason for the increase was the lower cost of building, installing and maintaining our products. Gross margin for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 declined by 1.0% compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, research and development expenses were 5% higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, as we funded new product development programs. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, research and development expenses declined 7% compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, due to completion of several projects that resulted in reductions in labor and material expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 and decreased 13% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 on account of various cost controls initiatives and reduced overhead support costs. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, we generated $350 million in cash flow from operations. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2004 compared to $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2003. We intend this executive summary as well as the discussion of our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. 29 Over the longer term, we expect process control to continue to represent a higher percentage of our customers’ capital spending. We believe this increase in process control spending will be driven by the demand for more precise diagnostics capabilities to address multiple new defects as a result of further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to copper and other new materials, and the transition to new 300-millimeter fabs. We anticipate these factors will drive increased demand for our products and services. New system and service orders by region were as follows (in millions): Fiscal Year 2004 Fiscal Quarter 2004 Fourth Third Second First United States $ 550 $ 158 $ 192 $ 129 $ 71 Europe 247 81 70 75 21 Japan 438 138 92 128 80 Taiwan 449 167 97 89 96 Asia Pacific 370 63 148 87 72 Total orders $ 2,054 $ 607 $ 599 $ 508 $ 340 Fiscal Quarter 2003 Fiscal Year 2003 Fourth Third Second First United States $ 374 $ 104 $ 98 $ 92 $ 80 Europe 167 39 40 58 30 Japan 289 101 64 67 57 Taiwan 135 28 44 17 46 Asia Pacific 216 65 70 52 29 Total orders $ 1,181 $ 337 $ 316 $ 286 $ 242 Our backlog for unshipped system orders as of June 30, 2004 was approximately $867 million, a majority of which we expect to ship over the next six to nine months. In addition, we have $543 million of deferred revenue that is related to products that have been delivered but are awaiting written acceptance from the customer. 30 Results of Operations Revenues and Gross Margin Product revenue in fiscal year 2004 increased $140 million, or 13% to $1.2 billion, from $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2003. Product revenue increases in fiscal year 2004 were primarily the result of increased capital spending, which we believe was a result of the beginning of a semiconductor industry upturn. Product revenue in fiscal year 2003 decreased $368 million, or 26% to $1.1 billion, from $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2002. Product revenue declines in fiscal year 2003 were primarily attributable to reduced capital spending by our customers as a result of a significant reduction in the demand for semiconductors over the last two years. In fiscal year 2004, international product revenue increased to 81% of product revenue, from 71% in fiscal year 2003, due to relatively higher product revenue in Japan, Korea and Asia Pacific partially offset by lower product revenue in Europe. In fiscal year 2003, international product revenue increased slightly to 71% of product revenue, from 69% in the prior year, due to higher demand in Taiwan. Service revenue is generated from maintenance service contracts, as well as time and material billable service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. Service revenues were $297 million, $263 million, and $209 million in fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Service revenue continued to increase in absolute terms throughout the three year period as our installed base of equipment at our customers’ sites continued to grow. The amount of service revenue generated is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the degree of utilization of those systems. As a result of the strong order growth we experienced in fiscal year 2004, which significantly increased our shipment backlog, we expect product shipments to continue to increase, which will result in an increase in product revenue. We expect service revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline with the increase in product revenue. Gross margins as a percentage of revenues were 55%, 49% and 50% in fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Approximately 4% of the increase in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 is attributable to streamlining of product manufacturing operations and cost management programs while approximately 2% of the improvement is attributable to improvements in installation, customer service and support programs. The decrease in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to reduced capacity utilization, resulting from lower business volume and an increased percentage of revenue in the lower margin service business. As the conditions in the semiconductor industry continue to strengthen, we expect gross margins to continue to improve with the further increase in sales volume, introduction of new models, streamlining manufacturing costs through the use of common platforms, leveraging manufacturing procurement through consolidation of vendors and further expanding on outsourcing initiatives. 31 Engineering, Research and Development Net engineering, research and development expenses were $281 million, $268 million, and $287 million, or 19%, 20% and 18% of revenues in fiscal year 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The gross dollars for research and development investment increased by $6 million for the fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003. The external funding received for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003, decreased by $7 million. The increase in gross research and development expenses was driven by an increase in project material and labor costs as we focus on the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, in response to the recovery in the semiconductor industry. We expect our net engineering, research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products and consolidation of the results of operations of a development stage semiconductor company as required by generally accepted accounting principles. The absolute dollars decreased in fiscal year 2003, compared to fiscal year 2002, due to engineering programs reaching certain milestones that resulted in reductions in labor and material expense, additional external funding and cost saving measures such as company mandated time-off and reduction in discretionary spending implemented during fiscal year 2003 in response to the industry slow down. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development efforts. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the further shrinking of device feature sizes, the transition to copper and other new materials, and the transition to new 300-millimeter fabs. Our investments in new technology and existing product enhancements are intended to enable our customers to achieve a higher return on their capital investments and higher productivity through cost-effective, leading edge technology solutions. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses were $249 million, $254 million and $291 million, or 17%, 19% and 18% of revenues, in fiscal year 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The absolute dollars for selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to company mandated time-off, reductions in labor and discretionary spending as well as other cost saving measures implemented over fiscal years 2003 and 2002, in response to the industry slowdown and the ongoing global economic weakness. We expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase as we build up our organization to meet increased customer demands. Non-Recurring Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and Other Charges In fiscal year 2004, there were no restructuring actions. In fiscal year 2003, we restructured certain of our operations to realign costs with planned business levels in light of the industry downturn. Restructuring costs were classified into two main categories: facilities and other charges of $4.6 million and severance and benefits of $1.1 million. As part of the facilities consolidation, we exited several of our leased buildings and included the remaining net book value of the related leasehold improvements as well as the future lease payments, net of anticipated sublease revenue, in the charge. Severance and benefit charges were related to the involuntary termination of approximately 70 employees from manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing, and administration in the United States, Japan and Europe. The restructuring actions taken in fiscal year 2003 are proceeding as planned, with the termination of employees having been completed and the facilities related lease payments we expect to complete by early fiscal year 2006. The annual estimated cost savings from these restructuring actions was $9 million, of which $7 million related to workforce reductions and $2 million related to consolidation of facilities and was not expected to have a material effect on our cost of goods sold or operating expenses. There were no material variances between the actual and anticipated costs of restructuring. The following table shows a summary of restructuring activity related to the fiscal year 2003 restructuring plan for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004: 32 (in thousands) Balance at June 30, 2003 Utilized Balance at June 30, 2004 Facilities and other $ 3,193 $ (2,372 ) $ 821 Severance and benefits $ 47 $ (47 ) $ — Total $ 3,240 $ (2,419 ) $ 821 In addition to the restructuring action, we also recorded severance charges totaling $10.9 million in operating expenses, throughout fiscal year 2003, relating to a series of involuntary employee terminations. We believe that both these actions will result in annual reductions in costs of goods sold and operating expenses of approximately $60 million. In fiscal year 2002, there were no restructuring charges. We recorded severance charges of $8.5 million in operating expenses relating to a series of involuntary employee terminations throughout fiscal year 2002. This resulted in annual cost reductions in costs of goods sold and operating expenses of approximately $44 million. The semiconductor equipment industry that we operate in is a highly cyclical industry. This cyclical nature affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels. If we were to enter into a down cycle, we may need to take appropriate actions to scale down operating expenses to lower business levels. 33 Interest Income and Other, Net Interest income and other, net was $27 million, $42 million and $43 million in fiscal year 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on the investment and cash portfolio, gains realized on sales of marketable securities and income recognized upon settlement of certain foreign currency contracts. The decrease in interest income and other, net for fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in gains realized on sales of marketable securities and decreased interest income resulting from declining interest rates, partially offset by an increase in gains on settlement of foreign currency contracts. The decrease in fiscal year 2003 as compared to fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to decreased interest income resulting from declining interest rates and an increase in foreign currency losses resulting from increased volatility in foreign exchange markets partially offset by an increase in realized gains on investments resulting from investment decisions which impacted the timing of realizing gains and losses for these investments. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 25%, 24% and 25% in fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In general, our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% largely as a function of benefits realized from our Extraterritorial Income (“ETI”) exclusion, research and development tax credits and interest income derived from tax exempt interest. The effective tax rate of 25% for fiscal year 2004 was higher than the effective tax rate of 24% realized in fiscal year 2003, as a result of more foreign tax expense and state tax, and less tax exempt interest and research and development tax credits. Partially offsetting these adverse changes was an increase in profits in low tax jurisdictions. The fiscal year 2004 effective tax rate of 25% includes a one time non-recurring benefit of $1.5 million related to the resolution of a prior year federal tax audit matter and a non-recurring write-off of a deferred tax asset of $1.2 million related to an investment. The overall reduction in our effective income tax rate from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2003 of 1% was primarily the result of more research and development expenses credit, more tax-exempt interest and less nondeductible losses relative to these same items as a percentage of pre-tax income in the prior fiscal year. These reductions were partially offset by more relatively foreign tax expense. Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non tax-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, amounts of tax-exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. There currently is pending legislation to repeal the existing export incentive provided by the United States Internal Revenue Code. If enacted, this legislation would likely increase our effective rate in future periods. In addition, the research and development credit contained in the United States Internal Revenue Code has expired under a sunset provision. While we expect federal legislation to be passed which would reinstate the research and development credit retroactive to July 1, 2004, we have not provided a benefit for the credit in our projected effective rate for fiscal year 2005. If the research and development credit is ultimately reinstated, our effective tax rate will be reduced. 34 Liquidity and Capital Resources Working capital was $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2004, compared to $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2003. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities at June 30, 2004 increased to $1.1 billion from $957 million at June 30, 2003. In addition, we maintained $743 million and $531 million in marketable securities classified as long-term as of June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We have historically financed our operations through cash generated from operations. Cash provided by operating activities was $350 million, $246 million, and $270 million in fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 was primarily due to increases in net income, deferred profit and accounts payable, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances. Net income and deferred profit increased in fiscal year 2004, compared to fiscal year 2003, primarily due to increased shipments, revenues and gross margins partially offset by increased engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses due to the ramp up in customer demand. Accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher shipments, partially offset by strong collection efforts. The increase in accounts payable and inventory was driven primarily due to a ramp up of production in response to increase in customer demand for our products. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 was primarily due to a decline in net income, increase in gains from sale of investments and other long-term assets partially offset by lower accounts receivable and inventory balances. Net income decreased in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal year 2002 primarily due to declining shipments, revenues and gross margins partially offset by decreased engineering, selling, general and administrative expenses associated with cost saving measures in response to the industry slowdown. Gains from the sale of investments increased due to investment decision regarding the timing of realizing gains and losses on these investments. Accounts receivable declined primarily due to strong collection efforts, as well as lower shipments. The reduction in inventory primarily occurred in production inventory, where stringent processes have been put in place for managing material procurement. We have agreements with three banking institutions to sell without recourse certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from Japanese customers. During fiscal year 2004 and 2003 we sold $116 million and $99 million, respectively, of trade receivables and promissory notes from Japanese customers, under these arrangements. At June 30, 2004 and 2003, $51 million and $27 million, respectively, of these receivables and notes were outstanding, which have not been included in our consolidated balance sheet. The total amount available under the facilities is the Japanese yen equivalent of $138 million based upon exchange rates as of June 30, 2004. We do not believe we are materially at risk for any losses as a result of these agreements. In addition, from time to time we will discount without recourse Letters of Credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment of goods. During the fiscal year 2004 several LCs were sold with proceeds totaling $42 million. Discounting fees of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2004 were equivalent to interest expense and were recorded in interest and other income net. Cash used in investing activities was $274 million, $99 million and $362 million in fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Investing activities typically consist of purchases and sales or maturities of marketable securities, purchases of capital assets to support long-term growth and acquisitions of technology or other companies to allow access to new market segments or emerging technologies. Additions of capital assets during fiscal year 2003 consisted mainly of the purchase of certain of our leased buildings in November 2002 compared to fiscal year 2002 additions that consisted mainly of the planned completion of our Livermore, California facilities. 35 We generated $113 million and $27 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal year 2004 and 2003, respectively, compared with $9 million of cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2002. Financing activities typically include sales and repurchases of our common stock, as well as borrowings and repayments of debt. Issuance of common stock provided $169 million, $92 million and $115 million in fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We used $56 million, $66 million and $123 million in fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively to repurchase shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program initiated in 1997. We have adopted a plan for the systematic repurchase of shares of our common stock in the open market to reduce the dilution created by our stock-based employee benefit and incentive plans. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through June 30, 2004 our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase a total of 17.8 million shares, including 5 million shares authorized in October 2002. In fiscal year 2004, we repurchased 1,175,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $47.49 per share, for a total of $56 million. In fiscal year 2003, we repurchased 1,972,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $33.42 per share, for a total of $66 million. In fiscal year 2002, we repurchased 3,341,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $36.89 per share, for a total of $123 million. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 1997 through June 30, 2004, we have repurchased a total of 14,496,000 shares at an average price of $33.90 per share, with an additional 3.3 million shares available for repurchase under the plan. All repurchased shares remain as treasury shares. Certain of our leased facilities qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 13, “Accounting for Leases,” and, as such, the facilities were not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lease agreement for certain Milpitas and San Jose, California facilities had a term of five years ending in November 2002, with an option to extend up to two more years. Under the terms of the lease, we, at our option, could acquire the properties at their original cost or arrange for the properties to be acquired. In November 2002, we purchased these facilities at the end of the lease term. The purchase transaction increased land and property by approximately $120 million and decreased cash by the same amount. At June 30, 2004, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, our management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. 36 The following is a schedule summarizing our significant operating lease commitments as of June 30, 2004 (in millions): Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Operating leases $ 23.9 $ 8.5 $ 5.6 $ 2.8 $ 1.8 $ 1.5 $ 3.7 Additionally, we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to help ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components. Our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecast time-horizon and penalties under cancellation provisions can vary amongst different suppliers. As such, it is difficult to report accurately our true open commitments at any particular point in time. However, we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of June 30, 2004 to be approximately $131 million. FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, INCLUDING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Fluctuations in Operating Results and Stock Price Our operating results have varied widely in the past, and our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon numerous factors, including those listed in this section and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, future operating results may not follow any past trends. We believe the factors that could make our results fluctuate and difficult to predict include: • the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; • global economic uncertainty; • changing international economic conditions; • competitive pressure; • our ability to develop and implement new technologies and introduce new products; • our customers’ acceptance and adoption of our new products and technologies; • our ability to manage our manufacturing requirements; • our ability to protect our intellectual property; • our ability to attract, retain, and replace key employees; • worldwide political instability; • earthquake and other uninsured risks; and • future changes in accounting and tax standards or practices Operating results also could be affected by sudden changes in customer requirements, currency exchange rate fluctuations and other economic conditions affecting customer demand and the cost of operations in one or more of the global markets in which we do business. As a result of these or other factors, we could fail to achieve our expectations as to future revenue, gross profit and income from operations. Our failure to meet the performance expectations set and published by external sources could result in a sudden and significant drop in the price of our stock, particularly on a short-term basis, and could negatively affect the value of any investment in our stock. 37 Semiconductor Equipment Industry Volatility The semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical. The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the semiconductor industry worldwide. The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict. This cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, thus, future expense levels. When cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand. We can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles. If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business could be seriously harmed. Global Economic Uncertainty Our business is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses. This end-user demand has been significantly depressed over the last few quarters and there has been very limited visibility as to the timing of turnaround in demand growth and from which sector this growth will come. A protracted global economic slowdown will continue to exacerbate this issue and may adversely affect our business and results of operation. International Trade, Operations and Economic Conditions We serve an increasingly global market. A majority of our annual revenue is derived from outside the United States, and we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenue. Our international revenue and operations are affected by economic conditions specific to each country and region. Because of our significant dependence on international revenue, a decline in the economies of any of the countries or regions in which we do business could negatively affect our operating results. Managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents challenges associated with, among other things, cultural diversity and organizational alignment. Moreover, each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period. Periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues, political instability or terrorism in regions where we have operations and fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates could negatively affect our business and results of operations. Although we attempt to manage near-term currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate. 38 Competition Our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide. Some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services, some of which compete with the products and service that we offer. These competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services, which we offer, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Loss of competitive position could negatively affect our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margins, and market share, any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. Technological Change and Customer Requirements Success in the semiconductor equipment industry depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions. For example, the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices, transition to copper and other new materials, and transition to new 300-millimeter fabs. While we expect these trends will increase our customers’ reliance on our diagnostic products, we cannot ensure that they will directly improve our business. These and other evolving customer needs require us to respond with continued development programs and to cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support. Technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staff of highly qualified employees. Our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards, to develop and introduce new products which successfully address changing customer needs, to win market acceptance of these new products and to manufacture these new products in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed. In this environment, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance and functionality of our products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development. Substantial research and development costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. In addition, we cannot ensure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us. Our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products. 39 Key Suppliers We use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials. We generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customers’ orders, we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing. We seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Our business would be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. Manufacturing Disruption Most of our manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, with a small operation located in Israel. Operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. Such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers. We cannot ensure that alternate production capacity would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if it were available, it could be obtained on favorable terms. Such disruption could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business. We currently are in the initial stages of design and implementation of a new integrated financial and supply chain management system. Disruptions or delays in making changes to our integrated financial and supply chain management system could adversely impact our operations and our ability to forecast sales demand, ship products, manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. Intellectual Property Obsolescence and Infringement Our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. We own various United States and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our technology that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own, adversely affecting our business. 40 We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and services and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. However, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or successfully deter infringement by third parties. While patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. We also maintain exclusive and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. As is typical in the semiconductor equipment industry, from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. Our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate. However, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. The inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms, or instigation of litigation or other administrative proceedings could seriously harm our operating results and financial condition. Key Employees Our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other employees are difficult to replace. We generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees. Further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. The expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain key personnel, or if we are not able to attract, assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our needs in the future, our business and operations could be harmed. Acquisitions In addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources, we also seek to acquire new technologies from external sources. As part of this effort, we may make acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with the integration of the operations and personnel, technologies and products of the acquired companies, the possible write-downs of impaired assets, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to manage these risks effectively could seriously harm our business. 41 Litigation From time to time we are involved in litigation of various types, including litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights and other claims. Litigation tends to be expensive and requires significant management time and attention and could have a negative effect on our results of operations or business if we lose or have to settle a case on significantly adverse terms. Compliance with Internal Controls Evaluations and Attestation Requirements Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we will be required, beginning in fiscal 2005, to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and have our auditor publicly attest to such evaluation. We have prepared an internal plan of action for compliance, which includes a timeline and scheduled activities, although as of the date of this filing we have not yet prepared the evaluation. Compliance with these requirements is expected to be expensive and time-consuming. If we fail to timely complete this evaluation, or if our registered independent accounting firm cannot timely attest to our evaluation, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Terrorism and Political Instability The threat of terrorism targeted at the regions of the world in which we do business, including the United States, increases the uncertainty in our markets and may delay any recovery in the general economy. Any delay in the recovery of the economy and the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business. Increased international political instability, as demonstrated by the September 2001 terrorist attacks, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of the terrorist attacks, and the continuing instability in the Middle East, may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations. Such continuing instability could cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate. This same instability could have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products. If this international political instability continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Earthquake and Other Uninsured Risks We purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks, however, certain other risks that are uninsurable or are insurable only at significant costs are not mitigated via insurance. An earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, most of which are conducted in California. It could also significantly delay our research and engineering effort on new products, most of which is also conducted in California. We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake. We self insure earthquake risks because we believe this is the prudent financial decision based on our large cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market. Certain other risks are also self insured either based on a similar cost benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance. If one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss. 42 Future Changes in Accounting and Taxation Standards or Practices A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For example, any changes requiring that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee stock options using the “fair value” method or changes in existing taxation rules related to stock options could have a significant negative effect on our reported results. Several agencies and entities are considering, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has announced, proposals to change generally accepted accounting principles in the United States that, if implemented, would require us to record charges to earnings for employee stock option grants. This pending requirement would negatively impact our earnings. Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” (SFAS 132) was issued and amends further the annual disclosure requirements and requires new quarterly disclosures for pensions and other postretirement benefits. The revised Statement addresses disclosures only. It does not address liability measurement or expense recognition, which is determined in accordance with SFAS 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS 87). We have provided the amended annual disclosures pursuant to SFAS 132 in Note 7 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In March 2004, the FASB issued a proposed Statement, “Share-Based Payment, an amendment of FASB Statements Nos. 123 and 95,” that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company’s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method that we currently use and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a “fair-value”-based method and recognized as expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The recommended effective date of the proposed statement is currently for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. Should this proposed statement be finalized in its current form, it will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations as we will be required to expense the “fair value” of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. In addition the proposed standard may have a significant impact on our consolidated cash flows from operations (no impact to our total consolidated cash flows) as, under this proposed standard, we will be required to reclassify a portion of our tax benefit on the exercise of employee stock options from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities. 43 In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under EITF Issue No. 03-01, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.” (“EITF 03-01”). The consensus clarifies the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to investments in debt and equity securities, in particular investments within the scope of FASB Statement No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and investments accounted for under the cost method. This consensus is to be applied to other-than-temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004. We do not believe that this consensus will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at June 30, 2004. Actual results may differ materially. At the end of fiscal year 2004, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.07 billion, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents (detail of these securities is included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2004, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $3 million. As of June 30, 2004, we had net forward contracts to sell $107 million in foreign currency in order to hedge currency exposures (detail of these contracts is included in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under “Derivative Instruments.” If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2004, the U.S. dollar equivalent would be $133 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $29 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that the hedging of our foreign currency exposure should have no material impact on income or cash flows. 44",2023-12-30 20:54:52.102726

319201,KLAC,KLA CORP,2011,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”)CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIESThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience, and evaluate them on an on-going basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows:Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We derive revenue from three sources—sales of systems, spare parts and services. We typically recognize revenue for system sales upon acceptance by the customer that the system has been installed and is operating according to predetermined specifications. Under certain circumstances, however, we recognize revenue prior to acceptance from the customer, as follows:•When system sales to independent distributors have no installation requirement, contain no acceptance agreement, and 100% payment is due upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment.•When the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.•When the customer fab has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and it can be objectively demonstrated that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria upon shipment, revenue is recognized upon shipment. The portion of revenue associated with installation is deferred based on estimated fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation.•When the customer withholds acceptance due to issues unrelated to product performance, revenue is recognized when the system is performing as intended and meets all published and contractually agreed specifications.•When the system is damaged during transit and title has passed to the customer, revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment from the customer.We enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted in one reporting period. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Additionally, judgment is required to interpret various commercial terms and determine when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.Trade-in rights are occasionally granted to customers to trade in tools in connection with subsequent purchases. We estimate the value of the trade-in right and reduce the revenue of the initial sale. This amount is recognized at the earlier of the exercise of the trade-in right or the expiration of the trade-in right.Spare parts revenue is recognized when the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.32Service and maintenance contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement that includes a software license agreement, amounts related to maintenance are allocated based on fair value. Services performed in the absence of a contract, such as consulting and training revenue, are recognized when the related services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured.The deferred system profit balance equals the amount of deferred system revenue that was invoiced and due on shipment, less applicable product and warranty costs. Deferred system revenue represents the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers which has not met our revenue recognition criteria. Deferred system profit does not include the profit associated with product shipments to customers in Japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to customers in Japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance.We also defer the fair value of non-standard warranty bundled with equipment sales as unearned revenue. Non-standard warranty includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. Non-standard warranty is recognized ratably as revenue when the applicable warranty term period commences.Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. Abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. We write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and parts inventory based on forecasted usage. These factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.Warranty. We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. Utilizing actual service records, we calculate the average service hours and parts expense per system and apply the actual labor and overhead rates to determine the estimated warranty charge. We update these estimated charges on a quarterly basis. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world. In order to monitor potential credit losses, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. We take into consideration (1) any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations; and (2) our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers. If circumstances change, such that the financial conditions of our customers are adversely affected and they are unable to meet their financial obligations to us, we may need to take additional allowances, which would result in a reduction of our net income.Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services based on the fair value of those awards. The fair value of stock-based awards is measured at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the employee’s requisite service period. The fair value is determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model for purchase rights under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date for restricted stock units. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of assumptions, including the option’s expected life and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the market-based implied volatility from traded options of our common stock.Contingencies and Litigation. We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.33Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We assess goodwill for impairment annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. See Note 6, “Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination. We conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill by reporting unit during the three months ended December 31, 2010 and concluded that there was no impairment. There have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the impairment test performed in the three months ended December 31, 2010. The next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed in the three months ending December 31, 2011.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have determined that a valuation allowance was necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we could be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable.On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.Valuation of Marketable Securities. Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security’s cost basis. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration of the investment, the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, default and loss rates of the underlying collateral, structure and credit enhancements to determine if a credit loss may exist. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.34Effects of Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the FASB amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. Under the amended guidance, an entity has the option to present comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two consecutive financial statements. A single statement must present the components of net income and total net income, the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income, and a total for comprehensive income. In a two-statement approach, an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement. That statement must be immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income, a total for other comprehensive income, and a total for comprehensive income. The option under current guidance that permits the presentation of components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity has been eliminated. The amendment becomes effective retrospectively for our interim period ending March 31, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect that this guidance will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature.In May 2011, the FASB amended its guidance, to converge fair value measurement and disclosure guidance about fair value measurement under U.S. GAAP with International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS""). IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board. The amendment changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the FASB does not intend for the amendment to result in a change in the application of the requirements in the current authoritative guidance. The amendment becomes effective prospectively for our interim period ending March 31, 2012. Early application is not permitted. We do not expect the amendment to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In December 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets. The amendment modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if there are qualitative factors indicating that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. This amendment was effective for our interim period ended March 31, 2011. The amendment did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In December 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on business combinations. Under the amended guidance, a public entity that presents comparative financial statements must disclose the revenues and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period. The amendment was effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date was on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The amendment did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In April 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on share-based payment awards denominated in certain currencies. The amendment clarifies that an employee share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market, performance or service condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. This amendment becomes effective for our interim period ending September 30, 2011. We do not expect the implementation to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements. This guidance now requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the reasons for these transfers. This authoritative guidance also requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance for Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements was effective for our interim reporting period ended March 31, 2010. The implementation did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature. The guidance for Level 3 fair value measurements disclosures becomes effective for our interim reporting period ending September 30, 2011, and we do not expect that this guidance will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as it is disclosure-only in nature.EXECUTIVE SUMMARYKLA-Tencor Corporation is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries. Our broad portfolio of products and services primarily supports integrated circuit (“IC” or “chip”) manufacturers throughout the semiconductor fabrication process, from research and development to final volume production. We provide leading-edge equipment, software and support that enable IC manufacturers to identify, resolve and 35manage significant advanced technology manufacturing process challenges and obtain higher finished product yields at lower overall cost. In addition to serving the semiconductor industry, we also provide a range of technology solutions to a number of other high technology industries, including the light emitting diode (“LED”), data storage and photovoltaic industries, as well as general materials research.Our products and services are used by the vast majority of bare wafer, IC, lithography reticle (""reticle"" or ""mask"") and disk manufacturers in the world. Our equipment, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure and control nanometric-level manufacturing processes, and to detect, analyze and resolve critical product defects that arise in that environment. Our revenues are driven largely by our customers' spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies, or to increase their production volumes in response to market demand. Our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or more of the three major semiconductor markets -- memory, foundry and logic. All three of these markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and sudden shifts in end-user demand, which influences the level and pattern of our customers' spending on our products and services. Although capital spending in all three semiconductor markets has been historically very cyclical, the demand for more advanced and lower cost chips used in a growing number of consumer electronics, communications, data processing, and industrial products has resulted in favorable long-term revenue growth rates for our process control and yield management solutions. We believe that, over the long term, our customers will continue to invest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density applications, as well as to reduce cost. We expect that this in turn will drive long-term increased adoption of process control equipment and services that reduce semiconductor defectivity and improve manufacturing yields.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries, we are subject to the cyclical capital spending that characterizes these industries. The timing, length and volatility of a capacity oriented capital spending cycle of our customers are unpredictable. In addition, our customer base continues to become more highly concentrated over time, thereby increasing the potential impact of a sudden change in capital spending by a major customer on our revenues and profitability. Nonetheless, we believe that over the long-term our customers will continue to increase their total spending on process control and yield management solutions, in response to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes, the transition to new production materials, new device and circuit architecture, more demanding lithography processes, the transition from 300 millimeter to 450 millimeter wafers, and new back-end packaging techniques.The growing use of increasingly sophisticated semiconductor devices in communications, consumer electronics, data processing, and automotive and aerospace products, combined with a somewhat improved economic environment during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, particularly in Asia, caused many of our customers to invest in additional semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and capacity. These investments included process control and yield management equipment and services, which had a significant favorable impact on our revenues, compared to the prior fiscal year. The resulting increase in revenues allowed us to leverage our infrastructure and improve manufacturing capacity utilization, driving an improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue, again as compared to the previous year.In recent weeks, however, there have been indications that the industry demand environment may be slowing in the near-term, as some of our customers appear to be reassessing their capacity expansion plans and timelines. Nevertheless, we believe that our customers remain committed to their roadmaps toward shrinking device sizes and other technological advancements as a means for driving future competitive differentiation and to lower costs, leaving the longer term drivers underlying growth in our industry intact.The following table sets forth some of our key consolidated financial information for each of our last three fiscal years: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009Total revenues$3,175,167 $1,820,760 $1,520,216Costs of revenues$1,259,243 $815,662 $864,824Gross margin percentage60% 55% 43%Net income (loss)$794,488 $212,300 $(523,368)Diluted income (loss) per share$4.66 $1.23 $(3.07)The results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 reflected improved fundamentals in the semiconductor industry driven by reduced uncertainty over the global economic environment and continued economic growth in much of Asia. As we increased our business activity levels and shipped more products to our customers during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, we continued to maintain cost discipline, which resulted in improved gross margins as well as net income.36The results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 were adversely impacted by the weak demand for semiconductor capital equipment and service due to the unfavorable global economic and industry conditions. The macroeconomic uncertainty led our customers to significantly reduce their factory operations and spending. While we took actions to restructure our operations and reduce our cost structure in response to the deteriorating market conditions, the rapid decline in revenues resulted in a significant deterioration in gross margins and a net loss. Our financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 also included significant charges associated with impairment of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring programs. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Microelectronic Inspection Equipment business unit (“MIE business unit”) of Vistec Semiconductor Systems for net cash consideration of $141.4 million. The acquired MIE business unit is a provider of mask registration measurement tools, Scanning Electron Microscope (“SEM”) based tools for mask critical dimension measurement and macro defect inspection systems.

Many of our customers continued to maintain high levels of capital spending for advanced technology development as well as capacity related investments, resulting in an increase in the number of tools that we sold and revenues that we recognized across each of the three major semiconductor markets (memory, foundry and logic), compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Our revenues have continued to grow each quarter over the past two years, as we continued to increase production, ship products and provide services to our customers to meet their process control and yield management requirements. An increase in the sales of both our defect inspection and metrology equipment contributed to the increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.Product revenues increased in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as a result of increased capital spending by customers for both technology and capacity related investments of process control equipment, in response to strong semiconductor electronics end market demand. New semiconductor manufacturing products targeted towards advanced production nodes were significant contributors to this increase in revenue as customers, particularly those serving the foundry market, added production capacity. These factors contributed to an increase in the number of tools that we sold during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The increase in tool sales over fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was primarily driven by an increase in our sales of defect inspection equipment.For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues:Year ended June 30,2011 2010 2009Intel Corporation Intel Corporation Intel CorporationTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. — —37Service revenuesService revenues are generated from maintenance contracts, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers after the expiration of the warranty period. The amount of service revenues generated is generally a function of the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers’ sites and the utilization of those systems. Service revenues continued to steadily increase during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 as a result of an increase in the number of post-warranty systems installed at our customers' sites as well as higher factory utilization by our customers. Revenues by regionRevenues by region for the periods indicated were as follows: Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009United States$610,955 19% $341,079 19% $372,887 24%Taiwan864,378 27% 688,089 38% 181,411 12%Japan413,208 13% 239,393 13% 437,081 29%Europe & Israel340,249 11% 111,497 6% 162,665 11%Korea480,488 15% 151,198 8% 187,624 12%Rest of Asia465,889 15% 289,504 16% 178,548 12%Total$3,175,167 100% $1,820,760 100% $1,520,216 100%A significant portion of our revenues continue to be generated in Asia, where a substantial portion of the world’s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue.Gross marginOur gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products, including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions. Over the past several years, we have embarked on various advanced product development, customer satisfaction improvement and globalization initiatives to improve our competitiveness and gross margins. Over the past eight quarters, our gross margin has generally benefited from the operating efficiencies associated with increasing revenues over that period. The following tables summarize the major factors that contributed to the changes in gross margin percentage: Gross Margin PercentageJune 30, 200943.1 %Revenue volume of products and service2.4 %Mix of products and services sold(1.5)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies4.1 %Other service and manufacturing costs7.1 %June 30, 201055.2 %Revenue volume of products and service3.9 %Mix of products and services sold(0.1)%Manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies1.6 %Other service and manufacturing costs(0.3)%June 30, 201160.3 %Changes in gross margin percentage driven by revenue volume reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. It also includes the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and average customer pricing. Changes in gross margin percentage from mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes in the composition within product and service offerings. Changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements; this includes the impact of capacity utilization, use of overtime and variability of cost structure. Changes in gross 38margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.Our gross margin increased to 60.3% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 from 55.2% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to increased demand and revenue from the sale of advanced technology defect inspection and metrology products.Our gross margin percentage increased to 55.2% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from 43.1% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to demand for new high value products, significant volume efficiencies in manufacturing operations worldwide, lower inventory obsolescence, as well as a lower overall manufacturing cost structure as a result of our outsourcing and globalization initiatives. In addition, productivity improvements resulting from better utilization of field service resources contributed to the gross margin improvement.Engineering, Research and Development (“R&D”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009 FY11 vs. FY10 FY10 vs. FY09R&D expenses$386,163 $329,560 $371,463 $56,603 17% $(41,903) (11)%R&D expenses as a percentage of total revenues12% 18% 24% (6)% (6)% R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, primarily due to an increase in engineering material costs of $24.2 million for program development related to our next-generation defect inspection products, an increase in employee-related expenses of $27.8 million as a result of additional engineering headcount and higher variable compensation, and an increase in external services of $9.7 million to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by an increase of $5.1 million in benefit to R&D expense from external funding. R&D expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, even as we made significant investments in product research and development. The decrease during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was primarily attributable to cost reduction activities initiated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, partially offset by higher variable compensation. In addition, development material costs and consulting services related to R&D product development decreased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 as certain significant new products completed the product development cycle during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and came to market in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. The decrease in R&D expenses primarily consisted of a decrease in employee-related expenses of $11.2 million; a decrease in engineering material costs of $14.1 million; a decrease in external services of $5.1 million; and a decrease in depreciation of fixed assets, amortization of intangibles and expensed in-process R&D (“IPR&D”) of $15.5 million; offset by a decrease in benefit to R&D expense from external funding of $8.0 million.During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, we expensed IPR&D of $8.6 million upon the completion of the acquisitions during the applicable fiscal year in connection with acquired intellectual property for which, as of the acquisition date, technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed. The fair value of the purchased IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects to their net present value. Future cash flows were estimated, taking into account the expected life cycles of the products and the underlying technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. We determined a discount rate for each project based on the relative risks inherent in the project’s development horizon, the estimated costs of development, and the level of technological change in the project and the industry, among other factors. IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no future alternative uses existed. The development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive threats. The nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning, designing, experimenting and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical requirements.R&D expenses include the benefit of $18.8 million, $13.7 million and $21.7 million of external funding received during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for certain strategic development programs primarily from government grants. We expect our R&D expenses to increase with increases in our business activity levels as we accelerate our investments in critical programs focusing on new technologies and enhancements to existing products.39Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. To do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial investments in our research and development. We remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies as we address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes.Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Year ended June 30, (Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009 FY11 vs. FY10 FY10 vs. FY09SG&A expenses$369,431 $361,372 $415,126 $8,059 2% $(53,754) (13)%SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues12% 20% 27% (8)% (7)% SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 were higher compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses of $37.0 million as a result of additional headcount to support higher sales volume and higher variable compensation, partially offset by a decrease in asset impairment charges of $13.4 million, a decrease in legal expenses of $9.1 million related to our historical stock option practices and certain indemnification obligations, and an increase in bad debt recovery of $6.7 million. SG&A expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 were lower compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 primarily due to cost reduction activities initiated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, partially offset by higher variable compensation. The decrease in SG&A expenses primarily consisted of a decrease in employee-related expenses of $21.3 million and a decrease in depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles of $10.5 million, partially offset by an increase in legal expenses for stockholder litigation relating to our historical stock option practices of $3.0 million. In addition, $2.9 million of bad debt recovery was recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to $23.2 million of bad debt expense recorded in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Interest Income and Other, Net Year ended June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009Interest income and other, net$4,064 $31,532 $30,749Interest expense$54,328 $54,517 $55,339Interest income and other, net as a percentage of total revenues0% 2% 2%Interest expense as a percentage of total revenues2% 3% 4%Interest income and other, net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our investment and cash portfolio, realized gains or losses on sales of marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, and impairments associated with equity investments in privately-held companies. The decrease in interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was primarily attributable to impairment charges of $9.9 million recorded during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 for equity investments in privately-held companies and partially offset by an international tax reserve benefit of $15.9 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitations relating to an uncertainty in our position with respect to a foreign transaction-based tax during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Interest income and other, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 remained flat. Interest expense is primarily attributable to the $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior fixed rate notes that we issued in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008.40Provision for Income TaxesThe following table provides details of income taxes: (In thousands)Year ended June 30, 2011 2010 2009Income (loss) before income taxes$1,110,066 $291,181 $(602,531)Provision for (benefit from) taxes315,578 78,881 (79,163)Effective tax rate28.4% 27.1% 13.1%The provision for income taxes differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate primarily due to foreign income with lower tax rates and tax credits, offset by state taxes, the tax effects of employee stock activity and other factors. Tax expense as a percentage of income during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was 28.4% compared to 27.1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Tax expense increased primarily from an increase in state tax expense, a decrease in the benefit from lower income earned outside the U.S. with lower tax rates, and an increase in tax reserves, offset by a decrease in the effect of shortfalls from employee stock activity.Tax expense as a percentage of income during the year ended June 30, 2010 was 27.1% compared to a benefit of 13.1% as a percentage of a loss in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. The difference in the percentages was primarily due to a decrease in the benefit on the loss incurred in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from a goodwill impairment charge of $277.0 million related to certain business units, which was non-deductible for tax purposes, and $38.1 million in additional tax expense due to a reduction in non-current deferred tax assets. The reduction in the deferred tax asset was a result of the adoption of California budget legislation, signed on February 20, 2009, which will allow a taxpayer to elect an alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. We expect to make the election to use the alternative method to attribute taxable income to California for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. In addition, there was less income earned outside the U.S. subject to lower tax rates in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, the domestic manufacturing deduction, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our Executive Deferred Savings Plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.We incurred $15.2 million and $12.0 million in additional tax expense during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to shortfalls from employee stock activity. Windfall tax benefits arise when a company's tax deduction for employee stock activity exceeds book compensation for the same activity. A shortfall arises when the tax deduction is less than book compensation. Windfalls are recorded as increases to capital in excess of par value. Shortfalls are recorded as decreases to capital in excess of par value to the extent that cumulative windfalls exceed cumulative shortfalls. Shortfalls in excess of cumulative windfalls are recorded as provision for income taxes. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, cumulative shortfalls from employee stock activity may continue to exceed cumulative windfalls from employee stock activity, and we may therefore report higher provision for income taxes as a result. Because we cannot determine all of the factors that will enter into our income tax expense computation for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, we cannot currently estimate this impact on our tax rate for the next fiscal year.In the normal course of business, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.41Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30,(Dollar amounts in thousands)2011 2010 2009Cash and cash equivalents$711,329 $529,918 $524,967Marketable securities1,327,206 1,004,126 804,917Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$2,038,535 $1,534,0440$1,329,884Percentage of total assets44% 39% 37% Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2011 2010 2009Net cash provided by operating activities$823,166 $447,800 $195,684Net cash used in investing activities(359,510) (227,964) (484,900)Net cash used in financing activities(300,155) (216,331) (299,117)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents17,910 1,446 (14,806)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$181,411 $4,951 $(603,139)As of June 30, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2 billion, which is an increase of $504 million from June 30, 2010. As of June 30, 2011, $678 million of the $2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. We currently intend to permanently reinvest approximately $421 million of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. If, however, a portion of these funds were to be needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. and foreign taxes of approximately 30%-50% of the funds repatriated. The amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated. We have accrued (but have not paid) U.S. taxes on the remaining cash of $257 million of the $678 million held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. As such, these funds can be returned to the U.S. without accruing any additional U.S. tax expense. The total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $167 million, $102 million and $102 million, respectively. The increase in the total amount of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the preceding fiscal years reflects an increase during the quarter ended September 30, 2010 to the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.15 to $0.25 per share. On July 12, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a further increase in the level of our quarterly dividend from $0.25 to $0.35 per share.The shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have decreased our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. The decrease was partially offset by additional shares issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of employee restricted stock units and in connection with stock purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In October 2008, we suspended our stock repurchase program, and we subsequently restarted the program in February 2010.We have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. Fiscal Year 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year 2010Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $448 million to $823 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in cash collections of approximately $1.4 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, due to higher sales volume, partially offset by•An increase in vendor payments of approximately $580 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, to support a higher level of business activities,•An increase in payroll expenses of approximately $170 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to bonus payments for fiscal year 2010 (which were paid during fiscal year 2010 and higher headcount), and•An increase in tax payments of approximately $270 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, due to higher profitability.42Cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $228 million to $360 million primarily as a result of an increase in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $124 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010.Cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from $216 million to $300 million as a result of the following key factors:•An increase in dividend payments of $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to an increase in the quarterly dividend payout amount which was announced in July 2010, and•An increase in common stock repurchases of $99 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, mainly due to the temporary suspension of our stock repurchase program from October 2008 to February 2010 due to market conditions, partially offset by•An increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $89 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Fiscal Year 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year 2009Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 increased compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from $196 million to $448 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•Lower operating expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, reduced by approximately $165 million compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, resulting primarily from our cost cutting measures initiated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, the benefits of which were fully realized in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010,•No material cash payments in the settlement of litigation during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to a cash payment of $65 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 in connection with the settlement of the stockholder class action litigation related to our historical stock option practices, and•An increase in customer collections of approximately $58 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, partially offset by•An increase in taxes paid of approximately $26 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.Cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from $485 million to $228 million primarily as a result of the following key factors:•A decrease of $140 million in acquisitions, primarily driven by the acquisition of the MIE business unit during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and•A decrease in the use of cash for purchases of available-for-sale and trading securities, net of sales and maturities, of approximately $141 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, partially offset by•A decrease in cash collections by approximately $16 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 from sale of assets, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.Cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 declined compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 from $299 million to $216 million as a result of lower common stock repurchases. We repurchased $136 million of our common stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to $227 million in stock repurchases during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.43Contractual ObligationsThe following is a schedule summarizing our significant obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of June 30, 2011: Fiscal year ending June 30,(In thousands)Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter OtherLong-term debt obligations(1)$750,000 $— $— $— $— $— $750,000 —Interest expense associated with long-term debt obligations353,625 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 51,750 94,875 —Purchase commitments352,404 340,730 8,136 3,390 130 18 — —Non-current income tax payable(2)85,537 — — — — — — 85,537Operating leases24,987 7,992 6,001 3,889 2,106 1,869 3,130 —Pension obligations27,556 2,001 1,240 2,185 2,927 2,466 16,737 —Total contractual cash obligations$1,594,109 $402,473 $67,127 $61,214 $56,913 $56,103 $864,742 $85,537 __________________ (1)In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in 2018.(2)Represents the non-current income tax payable obligation and related accrued interest. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.We have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. In addition, from time to time we will discount, without recourse, letters of credit (“LCs”) received from customers in payment for goods.The following table shows total receivables sold under factoring agreements and proceeds from sales of LCs and related discounting fees paid for the years ended June 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Year ended June 30,(In thousands)2011 2010 2009Receivables sold under factoring agreements$313,578 $107,666 $262,998Proceeds from sales of LCs$140,534 $37,226 $27,799Discounting fees paid on sales of LCs(1)$213 $189 $145 __________________ (1)Discounting fees include bank fees and interest expense and were recorded in interest income and other, net.We maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $20.4 million, of which $17.9 million had been issued as of June 30, 2011 primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for VAT and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in Europe and Asia. We maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply for key components. Our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. This forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. Our open inventory purchase commitments were approximately $352 million as of June 30, 2011, and are primarily due within the next 12 months. Actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. Certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.44We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 40 hours per week for twelve months, providing labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period. We account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to costs of revenues when revenue is recognized. The estimated warranty cost is based on historical product performance and field expenses. The actual product performance and/or field expense profiles may differ, and in those cases we adjust our warranty accruals accordingly. The difference between the estimated and actual warranty costs tends to be larger for new product introductions as there is limited historical product performance to estimate warranty expense; more mature products with longer product performance histories tend to be more stable in our warranty charge estimates. Non-standard warranty coverage generally includes services incremental to the standard 40-hour per week coverage for twelve months. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description.Working capital increased to $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2011, compared to $2.1 billion as of June 30, 2010. This increase is primarily due to cash generated from operations, offset by cash payments for our stock repurchase program, cash payments of dividends to stockholders, and purchases of fixed assets. As of June 30, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment industries. Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months.Our credit ratings and outlooks as of July 11, 2011 are summarized below: Rating AgencyRating OutlookFitchBBB StableMoody’sBaa1 StableStandard & Poor’sBBB StableFactors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, our financial position, and changes in our business strategy.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder our foreign currency risk management strategy, we utilize derivative instruments to protect our interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. This financial exposure is monitored and managed as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. We continue our policy of hedging our current and forecasted foreign currency exposures with hedging instruments having tenors of up to 18 months (see Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description). Our outstanding hedge contracts, with maximum maturity of 18 months, were as follows: As of June 30,(In thousands)2011 2010Cash flow hedge contracts Purchase$3,381 $15,835Sell$30,133 $32,853Other foreign currency hedge contracts Purchase$174,499 $82,535Sell$216,738 $104,414Indemnification Obligations. Subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify our current and former directors, officers and employees with respect to certain litigation matters and investigations that arise in connection with their service to us. These obligations arise under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that we are required to pay or reimburse the individuals’ reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. We paid or reimbursed legal expenses incurred in connection with the investigation of our historical stock option practices and the related litigation and government inquiries by a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees. We are currently paying defense costs to one former officer and employee facing an SEC civil action to which we are not a party. 45Although the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is theoretically unlimited, we believe the fair value of this liability, to the extent estimable, is appropriately considered within the reserve we have established for currently pending legal proceedings.We are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in connection with contracts and license agreements or the sale of assets, under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from, or provide customers with other remedies to protect against, bodily injury or damage to personal property caused by our products, non-compliance with our product performance specifications, infringement by our products of third-party intellectual property rights and a breach of warranties, representations and covenants related to such matters as title to assets sold, validity of certain intellectual property rights, non-infringement of third-party rights, and certain income tax-related matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by us is typically subject to the other party making a claim to and cooperating with us pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract. This usually allows us to challenge the other party’s claims or, in case of breach of intellectual property representations or covenants, to control the defense or settlement of any third-party claims brought against the other party. Further, our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of amounts, activity (typically at our option to replace or correct the products or terminate the agreement with a refund to the other party), and duration. In some instances, we may have recourse against third parties and/or insurance covering certain payments made by us. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.46ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2011. Actual results may differ materially.As of June 30, 2011, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $1.3 billion, excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents. These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2011, the fair value of the portfolio would decline by $1.1 million.As of June 30, 2011, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $69.0 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (detail of these contracts and hedging activities is included in Note 16, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2011, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $69.1 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $18.3 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our income or cash flows.In April 2008, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2011, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $746.3 million and $863.5 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2010, the book value and the fair value of our fixed rate debt were $745.7 million and $834.4 million, respectively.47",2023-12-30 20:54:54.240899
