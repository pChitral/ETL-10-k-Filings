Occidental’s integrated business provides conventional and unconventional opportunities through which to grow value. Occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of:ØMaintaining a sustainable and sector-leading dividend;ØAllocating capital to high-return, short-cycle and long-cycle, cash-flow generating opportunities across its integrated business;ØGenerating free cash flow growth to reduce debt and return cash to shareholders;ØAchieving production growth rates of up to 5% over the long-term; andØMaintaining a strong balance sheet to secure business and enhance shareholder value.Occidental conducts its operations with a focus on sustainability, health, safety and environmental and social responsibility. Capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Price volatility is inherent in the oil and gas business, and Occidental’s strategy is to position the business to thrive in an up- or down-cycle commodity price environment. On August 8, 2019, Occidental closed on its acquisition of Anadarko. The Acquisition added to Occidental’s oil and gas portfolio, primarily in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin and Gulf of Mexico, as well as a significant economic interest in WES. Post-Acquisition, Occidental’s diversified portfolio provides numerous competitive advantages. Occidental is now the largest oil and gas leaseholder in the United States on a net acreage basis with ample opportunities in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin, Powder River Basin and the Gulf of Mexico with the ability to selectively deploy capital in a way that optimizes capital intensity. As the acquired assets are integrated and developed, Occidental will utilize its subsurface and operating expertise to improve productivity and reduce full cycle costs. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORSOccidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success against key performance metrics that drive total stockholder return. In addition to efficient capital allocation and deployment discussed below, Occidental believes the following are its most significant metrics:ØHealth, safety and environmental and sustainability-related performance measures;ØAchieving debt reduction targets;ØTotal shareholder return, including dividends;ØMaintaining investment grade credit metrics;ØReturn on capital employed (ROCE) and cash return on capital employed (CROCE);ØSpecific measures such as earnings per share, per-unit profit, production cost, cash flow, finding and development costs and reserves replacement percentages; andØAcquisition-related synergy and divestiture targets. OIL AND GAS SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYOccidental’s oil and gas segment focuses on long-term value creation and leadership in sustainability, health, safety and the environment. In each core operating area, Occidental’s operations benefit from scale, technical expertise, decades of high-margin inventory, environmental and safety leadership, and commercial and governmental collaboration. These attributes allow Occidental to bring additional production quickly to market, extend the life of older fields at lower costs, and provide low-cost returns-driven growth opportunities with advanced technology. With the completion of the Acquisition, Occidental became the largest U.S. producer of oil and liquids in the second half of 2019, allowing Occidental to maximize cash margins on a BOE basis. Through the Acquisition, Occidental acquired modern 3D seismic data pertaining to approximately 450,000 square miles of core domestic development areas. This resulted in a 40% increase in Occidental’s Permian seismic inventory. The advantages that Occidental’s diversified portfolio provides, coupled with unmatched subsurface characterization ability and the proven ability to execute, ensures that Occidental is positioned for full-cycle success in the years ahead. The oil and gas segment continues to focus on integration of the newly acquired assets and efforts to realize synergies at an early stage to deliver lower breakeven costs and generate excess free cash flow. OXY 2019 FORM 10-K19MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS As a result of Occidental’s strategic positioning, Occidental’s assets provide current production and a future portfolio of projects that are flexible and have short-cycle investment paybacks. Together with Occidental’s technical capabilities, the oil and gas segment strives to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize full-cycle value of the assets.The oil and gas business implements Occidental’s strategy primarily by:Ø Operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and optimizing capital intensity in core areas, primarily in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico, UAE, Oman, Qatar and Colombia;Ø Maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach to capital expenditures with a focus on high-return, short-cycle, cash-flow-generating opportunities and an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing Occidental’s existing positions;Ø Focusing Occidental’s subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities, primarily in the Permian Basin;Ø Using enhanced oil recovery techniques, such as CO2, water and steam floods in mature fields; andØ Focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies and innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions.In 2019, oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately $5.5 billion and primarily focused on Occidental’s assets in the Permian Basin, the DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and Oman. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTOil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance. The following table presents the average daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) prices for 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 % ChangeWTI oil ($/barrel) $57.03 $64.77 (12)%Brent oil ($/barrel) $64.18 $71.53 (10)%NYMEX gas ($/Mcf) $2.67 $2.97 (10)%The following table presents Occidental’s average realized prices for continuing operations as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018Worldwide oil as a percentage of average WTI 98% 94%Worldwide oil as a percentage of average Brent 87% 85%Worldwide NGL as a percentage of average WTI 30% 41%Worldwide NGL as a percentage of average Brent 27% 37%Domestic natural gas as a percentage of NYMEX 49% 54%Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it difficult to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.DOMESTIC INTERESTS BUSINESS REVIEWOccidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns, or a combination of both. Occidental’s domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences. Occidental has leasehold and mineral interests in 14.4 million net acres, of which approximately 39% is leased, 55% is owned subsurface mineral rights and 6% is owned land with mineral rights. Included in Occidental’s total net acres is approximately 7 million net acres of primarily undeveloped minerals that pass through Colorado, Wyoming and into Utah. Occidental holds fee ownership of oil and gas, mineral and hardrock mineral rights in this area. 20OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The following chart shows Occidental’s domestic production volumes for the last five years:Note: Operations sold include South Texas (sold in April 2017), Piceance (sold in March 2016) and Williston (sold in November 2015).DOMESTIC ASSETS1. Powder River Basin2. DJ Basin3. Greater Natural Buttes 4. Permian Basin5. Gulf of MexicoPermian Basin The Permian Basin extends throughout West Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for more than 30% of total United States oil production in 2019. Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two business units: Permian Resources, which includes growth-oriented unconventional opportunities, and Permian EOR, which utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques such as CO2 floods and waterfloods. Occidental has a leading position in the Permian Basin, producing approximately 11% of total oil inthe basin. Occidental’s position in the Texas Delaware sub-basin was further enhanced through assets acquired as part of the Acquisition. By exploiting the natural synergies between Permian Resources and Permian EOR, Occidental is able to deliver unique short- and long-term advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its Permian Basin operations. Occidental expects to decrease its Permian Basin full-cycle breakeven costs, while continuing to expand its high-quality, low-cost OXY 2019 FORM 10-K21MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS breakeven inventory. Occidental expects the combined technical advancements, infrastructure utilization opportunities and operations across over 3.1 million net acres will provide sustainability of Occidental’s low-cost position in the Permian Basin. In the next few years, growth within Occidental’s Permian Basin portfolio is expected to be focused in the Permian Resources unconventional assets. In 2019, Occidental spent approximately $3.8 billion of capital in the Permian Basin, of which over 85% was spent on Permian Resources assets. In 2020, Occidental expects to allocate approximately 40% of its worldwide capital budget to Permian Resources for development and approximately 8% to Permian EOR for the expansion of existing facilities to increase CO2 production and injection capacity.In November 2019, Occidental and Ecopetrol formed a joint venture to explore and develop approximately 97,000 net acres of Occidental’s Midland sub-basin properties in the Permian Basin. Occidental owns a 51% interest in the joint venture and is the operator. In exchange for its 49% interest, Ecopetrol paid $750 million in cash to Occidental at closing and will carry 75% of Occidental’s share of capital expenditures, up to $750 million. The joint venture allows Occidental to accelerate its development plans in the Midland Basin, where it currently has minimal activity. Occidental will retain production and cash flow from its existing operations in the Midland Basin. 1. Delaware Basin2. Central Basin Platform3. Midland BasinPermian ResourcesPermian Resources unconventional oil development projects provide very short-cycle investment payback, averaging less than two years, and generate some of the highest margin and returns of any oil and gas projects in the world. These investments contribute cash flow and production growth, while increasing long-term value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed. As part of the Acquisition, Occidental acquired Anadarko’s oil and gas operations in Permian Resources which included approximately 370,000 net acres, including 240,000 net acres located primarily within Loving and Reeves Counties. A new well design and flowback method will be implemented in 2020, which is expected to lower the overall well cost while improving completion efficiency. The 2020 plan contemplates the continued development of the newly acquired acreage. Occidental’s share of production from the acquired assets in Permian Resources was approximately 159 thousand BOE per day (MBOE/d) from the Acquisition date through December 31, 2019. Overall in 2019, Permian Resources produced approximately 355 MBOE/d from approximately 7,600 gross wells. In 2019, Permian Resources added 173 MMBOE to Occidental’s proved reserves for improved recovery additions.Permian EORThe Permian Basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs, favorable CO2 flooding performance and the proximity to naturally occurring CO2 supply has resulted in decades of high-value enhanced oil production. With 34 active CO2 floods and over 40 years of experience, Occidental is the industry leader in Permian Basin CO2 flooding, which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10% to 25%. Technology improvements, such as the recent trend toward vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets, continue to yield more recovery from existing projects. Occidental utilizes workover rigs to drill extra depth into additional CO2 floodable sections of the reservoir. Occidental completed 72 well workovers in 2019 and has plans to complete 81 well workovers in 2020. In 2019, Permian EOR added 14 MMBOE to Occidental’s proved 22OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS reserves for improved recovery additions, primarily as a result of executing CO2 flood development projects and expansions. Occidental’s share of production from Permian EOR was approximately 154 MBOE/d in 2019.Significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding Occidental’s existing CO2 projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been water-flooded. Permian EOR has a large inventory of future CO2 projects, which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions. In addition, OLCV continues making progress towards supplying anthropogenic, or man-made, CO2 for the purpose of carbon capture, utilization and storage in Occidental’s Permian EOR operations. DJ BasinThrough the Acquisition, Occidental is Colorado’s top oil and gas producer with interest in approximately 650,000 net acres. Production is derived from 2,700 operated vertical wells and 2,000 operated horizontal wells primarily focused in 460,000 net acres in the Niobrara and Codell formations. The DJ Basin provides competitive economics, low breakeven costs and free cash-flow generation.Occidental’s share of production from the DJ Basin was approximately 303 MBOE/d from the Acquisition date through December 31, 2019. Horizontal drilling results in the field continue to be strong, with improved operational efficiencies in drilling and completions. License to operate continues to be a key focus moving into 2020. Occidental has a majority of its planned 2020 completions activity permitted. Occidental maintains optionality by flexing resources between DJ Basin and another emerging high rate- of-return program in the Powder River Basin.Powder River In the southern Powder River Basin, Occidental acquired through the Acquisition approximately 400,000 net acres mainly located in Converse County, Wyoming. The field contains the Turner, Niobrara, Mowry and Parkman formations that hold both liquids and natural gas.Greater Natural ButtesThe Greater Natural Buttes area in eastern Utah is a tight-gas asset producing primarily from the Mesa Verde, Wasatch and Blackhawk formations. Occidental uses cryogenic and refrigeration processing facilities in this area to extract NGLs from the natural-gas stream. There was no development activity in this field during 2019 due to capital being allocated to higher-margin projects.OFFSHORE DOMESTIC ASSETSGulf of MexicoOccidental owns a working interest in 230 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, operates 10 active floating platforms and holds interests in 18 active fields. In 2020, Occidental will take advantage of its extensive infrastructure across the Gulf of Mexico to execute its long-term plan for development and exploration. It will operate one floating drillship and three platform rigs together with a floating well service rig to cost effectively develop known resources and perform exploration activities to identify tie-back opportunities near existing facilities. The following table shows areas of continuing development in the Gulf of Mexico along with the corresponding working interest in those areas. Acquired assets in the Gulf of Mexico produced approximately 147 MBOE/d from the Acquisition date through December 31, 2019. In addition to its portfolio of undeveloped leases, Occidental’s Gulf of Mexico exploration assets are primarily related to a deepwater discovery located with tie-back proximity to the Horn Mountain platform.

Its activities include oil, natural gas and NGL production through direct working-interest and production sharing contracts (PSC).Production Sharing Contracts Occidental’s interest in Oman and Dolphin are subject to PSCs. Under such contracts, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit. In addition, certain contracts in Colombia are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Overall, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.The following chart shows Occidental’s international production volumes for the last five years:Note: Operations sold, exited or held for sale include the Africa Assets (sold in 2019 or held for sale at December 31, 2019), Qatar (exited in 2019) and other Middle East and North Africa operations exited in 2016 and 2015. MIDDLE EAST ASSETS 24OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OmanIn Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 with a 50% working interest, Block 27 with a 65% working interest, Block 53 with a 45% working interest and Block 62 with a 100% working interest. In 2018 and 2019, Occidental entered into Exploration and Production Sharing Agreements for Blocks 30, 51, 65 and 72, which increased the acreage that Occidental holds in Oman from 2.3 million to 6.0 million gross acres and the potential well inventory locations to approximately 10,000. In 2019, Occidental’s share of production was 89 MBOE/d. The Block 9 contract expires in 2030 and the Block 27 contract expires in 2035. Occidental’s share of production for Blocks 9 and 27 was 27 MBOE/d and 7 MBOE/d in 2019, respectively. The Block 53 (Mukhaizna Field) contract expires in 2035 and is a major world-class pattern steam flood project for enhanced oil recovery that utilizes some of the largest mechanical vapor compressors ever built. Since assuming operations in Mukhaizna in 2005, Occidental has drilled over 3,450 new wells and has increased gross production by over 15 fold. Occidental’s share of production for Block 53 was 33 MBOE/d in 2019. Subject to declaration of commerciality, Block 62 will expire in 2028. Occidental’s share of production for Block 62 was 22 MBOE/d in 2019. United Arab EmiratesIn 2011, Occidental acquired a 40% participating interest in Al Hosn Gas, joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in a 30-year joint venture agreement. In 2019, Occidental’s share of production from Al Hosn Gas was 251 MMcf per day of natural gas and 40,000 barrels per day of NGL and condensate. Al Hosn Gas includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in “Marketing and Midstream Segment - Gas Processing, Gathering and CO2 .”In 2019, Occidental acquired a 9-year exploration concession and, subject to a declaration of commerciality, a 35-year production concession for onshore Block 3 which covers an area of approximately 1.5 million acres and is adjacent to Al Hosn Gas. Occidental conducts a majority of its Middle East business development activities through its office in Abu Dhabi, which also provides various support functions for Occidental’s Middle East oil and gas operations.QatarIn Qatar, Occidental partners in the Dolphin Energy project, an investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests. Occidental has a 24.5% interest in the upstream operations to develop and produce natural gas, NGL and condensate from Qatar’s North Field through mid-2032. Occidental also has a 24.5% interest in Dolphin Energy Limited, which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in “Marketing and Midstream Segment – Pipeline.” Occidental’s net share of production from the Dolphin upstream operations was 42 MBOE/d in 2019.In 2019, Occidental’s contract for Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) expired, and there was a mutually agreed early termination of its Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD) contract.LATIN AMERICA ASSETS1. La Cira-Infantas Waterflood Area2. Llanos Norte Basin 3. Teca Heavy Oil Area4. Putumayo BasinColombiaOccidental has working interests in the La Cira-Infantas and Teca areas and has operations within the Llanos Norte Basin. Occidental’s interests range from 39% to 61% and certain interests expire between 2023 and 2038, while others extend through the economic limit of the areas.OXY 2019 FORM 10-K25MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS In 2019, Occidental and Ecopetrol initiated Teca steam flood project second phase development activities. During 2019, 17 new wells were drilled, and the initial facility upgrade project began.Occidental also farmed into two additional blocks in the prospective Putumayo Basin, consolidating a position of 1.6 million gross acres in the basin.Occidental’s net share of production from Colombia was 33 MBOE/d in 2019.AFRICA ASSETSIn September 2019, Occidental completed the sale of Mozambique LNG assets to Total for approximately $4.2 billion. In January 2020, Occidental completed the sale of South Africa assets to Total. Occidental and Total continue to work toward completing the sales of the remaining Africa Assets during 2020. The results of the Africa Assets are presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Cash Flows. The remaining Africa Assets are classified as held-for-sale and not considered part of Occidental’s ongoing international operations as of December 31, 2019. Operations in Algeria involve production and development activities in Blocks 404A and 208 of Algeria’s Sahara Desert. The El Merk Central Processing Facility (CPF) in Block 208 processed produced oil and NGL, while the Hassi Berkine South and Ourhoud CPFs in Block 404A processed only produced oil. Ghana operations include production and development activities located offshore in the West Cape Three Point Block and the Deepwater Tano Block.PROVED RESERVESProved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. Oil, NGL and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs. The following table shows the 2019, 2018 and 2017 calculated average prices for both WTI and Brent oil prices, as well as the NYMEX gas prices: 2019 2018 2017WTI oil ($/barrel) $55.69 $65.56 $51.34Brent oil ($/barrel) $63.03 $72.20 $54.93NYMEX gas ($/Mcf) $2.58 $3.10 $2.98Occidental had proved reserves from continuing operations at year-end 2019 of 3,827 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) (excluding the Africa Assets), compared to the year-end 2018 amount of 2,752 MMBOE. Proved developed reserves represented approximately 76% and 73% of Occidental’s total proved reserves at year-end 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following table shows the breakout of Occidental’s proved reserves from continuing operations by commodity as a percentage of total proved reserves: 2019 2018Oil 52% 57%Natural gas 29% 25%NGL 19% 18%Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources. For further information regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, see “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information.”The following table details the proved developed and undeveloped reserves related to the Africa Assets that were presented as held for sale at December 31, 2019: Oil (MMbbl) NGL(MMbbl) Natural Gas (Bcf) Total (MMBOE)Proved developed reserves 99 7 19 109Proved undeveloped reserves 14 — 11 1626OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CHANGES IN PROVED RESERVES Occidental’s total proved reserves from continuing operations increased 1,075 MMBOE in 2019, which was primarily driven by additions of 1,311 MMBOE primarily from the Acquisition and 356 MMBOE from Occidental’s development program. Changes in reserves were as follows:MMBOE 2019Revisions of previous estimates (200)Improved recovery 293Extensions and discoveries 63Purchases 1,311Sales (29)Production (363)Total 1,075Occidental’s ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect Occidental’s reserves. Purchases of Proved ReservesIn 2019, Occidental purchased proved reserves of 1,311 MMBOE primarily as part of the Acquisition, including proved reserves in the Permian Delaware Basin, the DJ Basin and Gulf of Mexico. As part of smaller asset purchases separate from the Acquisition, Occidental purchased proved reserves in Permian Resources New Mexico. Revisions of Previous EstimatesRevisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data. In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental. For example, lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations. Offsetting this effect, lower prices increase Occidental’s share of proved reserves under PSCs because more oil is required to recover costs. Conversely, when prices rise, Occidental’s share of proved reserves decreases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations. Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease, as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data. In 2019, Occidental had negative revisions of 200 MMBOE, primarily related to negative price revisions, changes to development plans and reservoir performance in the Permian Basin. Improved RecoveryIn 2019, Occidental added proved reserves of 293 MMBOE mainly associated with the Permian Basin. These properties comprise both conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO2 flood, waterflood or steam flood, and unconventional projects. These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration. Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells. The use of either CO2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either CO2 or steam and other economic factors. Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells. Many of Occidental’s projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells. In addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells.Extensions and DiscoveriesOccidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs. In 2019, extensions and discoveries added 63 MMBOE primarily related to the recognition of proved undeveloped reserves due to post-Acquisition activities for acquired properties in the Permian Basin and Gulf of Mexico.Sales of Proved ReservesIn 2019, Occidental sold 29 MMBOE in proved reserves mainly related to non-core Permian Basin acreage. OXY 2019 FORM 10-K27MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Proved Undeveloped ReservesOccidental had proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2019 of 904 MMBOE, compared to the year-end 2018 amount of 750 MMBOE. Changes in proved undeveloped reserves were as follows:MMBOE 2019Revisions of previous estimates (166)Improved recovery 192Extensions and discoveries 36Purchases 317Sales (29)Transfer to proved developed reserves (196)Total 154Occidental incurred approximately $1.8 billion in 2019 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Permian Basin added approximately 500 MMBOE through improved recovery and purchases. The 2019 additions to proved undeveloped reserves were partially offset by 196 MMBOE transfers to proved developed reserves, primarily in the Permian Basin, 166 MMBOE of negative revisions of previous estimates primarily related to negative price revisions, changes to development plans and reservoir performance in the Permian Basin.Occidental’s highest-return projects and most active development areas are located in the Permian Basin, which represented 44% of the proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2019. Nearly half of Occidental’s 2020 capital program of $5.3 billion is allocated to the development program in the Permian Basin. Overall, Occidental plans to spend approximately $3.6 billion over the next five years to develop its proved undeveloped reserves in the Permian Basin. Occidental’s proved undeveloped reserves in international locations are associated with approved long-term international development projects.RESERVES EVALUATION AND REVIEW PROCESSOccidental’s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2019, were made by Occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management. The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves. This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts. As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves. Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced, and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance. These reliable field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Proved undeveloped reserves are supported by a five-year, detailed, field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled. The development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel. Annually a detailed review is performed by Occidental’s Worldwide Reserves Group and its technical personnel on a lease-by-lease basis to assess whether proved undeveloped reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date. Any leases not showing timely transfers from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and have sufficient capital committed in the development plan. Only proved undeveloped reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan. A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development plans. The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with U.S. SEC rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental’s oil and gas reserves data. He has over 35 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business, and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe. He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. He is an American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Certified Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation. He is a member of the Society 28OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the UNECE Expert Group on Resource Management. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental’s oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental’s Board of Directors during the year. Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes. In addition, Occidental utilized Miller and Lents, Ltd. (M&L), independent petroleum engineering consultants who were previously retained by Anadarko, to review the annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes associated with the Anadarko reserves. For additional reserves information, see Supplemental Oil and Gas Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In 2019, both Ryder Scott and M&L conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2019, in accordance with SEC regulatory standards. Ryder Scott and M&L reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental’s 2019 year-end total proved reserves portfolio. In 2019, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 20% of legacy Occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 80% of legacy Occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves. M&L reviewed approximately 90% of the Anadarko proved oil and gas reserves. Management retained Ryder Scott and M&L to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process. Neither Ryder Scott nor M&L has been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental. Occidental has filed Ryder Scott’s and M&L’s independent reports as exhibits to this Form 10-K. Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott and M&L have concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKThe petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions. WTI and Brent oil price indexes increased throughout 2019 closing at $61.06 per barrel and $66.00 per barrel, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and costs in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.NGL prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids. Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock. In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.These and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil, NGL and domestic gas prices reliably. For purposes of the current capital plan, Occidental will continue to focus on allocating capital to its highest-return assets with the flexibility to adjust based on fluctuations in commodity prices. International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts. Occidental continues to adjust capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital.OXY 2019 FORM 10-K29MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CHEMICAL SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYOxyChem seeks to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns. The chemical segment focuses on being a low-cost producer in order to maximize cash flow generation. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain, beginning with the co-production of caustic soda and chlorine. Caustic soda and chlorine are marketed to external customers. In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into polyvinyl chloride (PVC). OxyChem’s focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale. Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets. Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities. In 2019, capital expenditures for OxyChem totaled $267 million. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTIn 2019, the United States economic growth rate, estimated to be 2.3%, was lower than the 2.9% experienced in 2018, which resulted in lower demand for caustic soda and PVC. Ethylene prices trended downward in the first half of 2019 before increasing in the second half of the year with the total year average ethylene price being less than that of 2018. Pricing for caustic soda and PVC was lower in 2019, partially offset by lower energy and feedstock costs. Domestic demand for caustic soda and PVC was negatively impacted by slower or no growth in manufacturing, automotive and construction markets as well as a weaker pulp and paper market. BUSINESS REVIEWBASIC CHEMICALS The lower U.S. growth rate resulted in lower domestic demand as the industry chlor-alkali operating rates decreased by 3% compared to 2018. Liquid caustic soda prices were lower both domestically and globally in 2019 due to weaker demand in the alumina and pulp and paper market segments, which was partially offset by lower energy prices than in 2018. Exports of downstream chlorine derivatives into the vinyls chain decreased in 2019 as demand for PVC lagged year-over-year. VINYLSDemand for PVC in 2019 decreased year-over-year in total as domestic demand was down 3% from 2018 while export demand increased by less than 1%. Domestic demand was weaker in the first half of 2019 due to lower construction demand caused by weather conditions and demand did not fully recover in the second half of 2019. Export demand growth was driven by emerging economy growth and competitive North American feedstock costs. Export volume remains a significant portion of PVC sales representing over 34% of total North American producer’s production. PVC industry operating rates decreased by 1% compared to 2018. Industry PVC margins decreased in 2019 due to lower PVC prices partially offset by lower ethylene prices in the first half of 2019 and lower energy prices than in 2018. INDUSTRY OUTLOOKIndustry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets. The housing and construction markets are expected to strengthen over the next year while the automotive and durable goods markets look to remain flat or decrease slightly. Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices. Weakening in the petroleum industry may negatively affect the demand and pricing of a number of Occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants. U.S. commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. BASIC CHEMICALSContinued improvement in the United States housing market, offset by flat to weakening automotive and durable goods markets, are expected to result in a flattening to a moderate increase in demand for basic chemical products in 2020. Export demand for caustic soda is expected to be similar to 2019 levels driven by limited demand improvement into the alumina market. Chlor-alkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs. Businesses such as calcium chloride and muriatic acid may be affected by flatter U.S. oil growth trends, as well as shifts in drilling technology. VINYLSNorth American demand for PVC is expected to improve in 2020 over 2019 levels, as growth in residential construction spending is expected to rebound along with upside potential driven by new infrastructure projects. Although overall demand is expected to increase in North America, operating rates are anticipated to remain relatively flat in 2020 as new PVC capacity is expected to enter the market. Growth in the export market is likely along with favorable ethylene costs continuing in 2020. 30OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS MARKETING AND MIDSTREAM SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYThe marketing and midstream segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing the use of its gathering, processing, transportation, storage and terminal commitments and by providing access to domestic and international markets. To generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to Occidental’s subsidiaries, as well as third parties. The marketing and midstream segment operates gathering systems, gas plants, co-generation facilities and storage facilities and invests in entities that conduct similar activities. From August 8, 2019, to December 31, 2019, WES’s operating results were consolidated in the marketing and midstream segment. As of December 31, 2019, Occidental will account for its ownership investment in WES under the equity method of accounting. See Note 16 - Investments and Related-Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also within the marketing and midstream segment is OLCV. OLCV seeks to capitalize on Occidental’s EOR leadership by developing carbon capture, utilization and storage projects that source anthropogenic CO2 and promote innovative technologies that drive cost efficiencies and economically grow Occidental’s business while reducing emissions.This segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas, power and other commodities used in Occidental’s various businesses. Capital is employed to sustain or expand assets to improve the competitiveness of Occidental’s businesses. In 2019, capital expenditures related to the marketing and midstream segment totaled $461 million (including $365 million related to WES).BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTMarketing and midstream segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses, including its marketing, gathering and transportation, gas processing and power-generation assets. The marketing business aggregates, markets and stores Occidental and third-party volumes. Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. The marketing business results can experience significant volatility depending on commodity price changes and the Midland to Gulf Coast spreads. In 2019, the Permian takeaway capacity increased as several new third-party pipelines were completed, which in turn reduced the Midland to Gulf Coast spreads. Gas gathering, processing and transportation results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment’s plants, as well as the margins obtained on related services from investments in which Occidental has an equity interest. The 2019 declines in NGL prices and sulfur prices negatively impacted the gas processing business. BUSINESS REVIEWMARKETINGThe marketing group markets substantially all of Occidental’s oil, NGL and natural gas production, as well as trades around its assets, including contracted transportation and storage capacity. Occidental’s third-party marketing activities focus on purchasing oil, NGL and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets. These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets. In 2019, compared to the prior year, marketing results were negatively impacted by the decline in the Midland-to-Gulf Coast spreads, as well as non-cash mark-to-market losses. OXY 2019 FORM 10-K31MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PIPELINEOccidental’s pipeline business mainly consists of its 24.5% ownership interest in Dolphin Energy. Dolphin Energy owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman. The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of natural gas per day and currently transports approximately 2.2 Bcf per day, and up to 2.5 Bcf per day in the summer months. In 2019, compared to the prior year, pipeline income declined due to the 2018 sale of the Centurion Pipeline common carrier oil pipeline and storage system and the Ingleside Crude Terminal.GAS PROCESSING, GATHERING AND CO2 Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGL and other gas byproducts, including CO2, and delivers dry gas to pipelines. Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGL. As of December 31, 2019, Occidental has 54.5% of limited partner unit interest and a 2% non-voting general partner unit interest in WES. In addition, Occidental has a 2% non-voting limited partner interest in Western Midstream Operating, LP, a consolidated subsidiary of WES. Prior to December 31, 2019 Occidental consolidated WES. As of December 31, 2019, Occidental recognizes WES as an equity method investment. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. WES owns gathering systems, plants and pipelines and earns revenue from fee-based and service-based contracts with Occidental and third parties.Occidental also has a 40% participating interest in Al Hosn Gas which is designed to process 1.3 Bcf per day of natural gas and separate it into salable gas, condensate, NGL and sulfur. In 2019, the facilities produced approximately 11,500 metric tons per day of sulfur, of which approximately 4,600 metric tons was Occidental’s share. Al Hosn Gas facilities generate revenues from gas processing fees and the sale of sulfur. In 2019, compared to the prior year, gas processing, gathering and CO2 results increased primarily due to income from WES partially offset by lower NGL prices and sulfur prices which negatively impacted the gas processing business. POWER GENERATION FACILITIESEarnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties. LOW CARBON VENTURESOLCV was formed to execute on Occidental’s vision to reduce global emissions and provide a more sustainable future through low carbon energy and products. OLCV capitalizes on Occidental’s extensive experience in utilizing CO2 for EOR by investing in technologies, developing projects and providing services to facilitate and accelerate the implementation of carbon capture, utilization and storage projects and opportunities for zero-carbon power. Moreover, OLCV is fostering new technologies and business models with the potential to position Occidental as a leader in the production of low-carbon oil and products.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKMarketing and midstream segment results can experience volatility depending on the Midland to Gulf Coast spreads and commodity price changes. The decline in the Midland to Gulf Coast spreads in the second half of 2019 has continued into the early part of 2020. If the spread remains at current levels or are lower for the rest of 2020, this could significantly reduce margins in the marketing business. To a lesser extent, declines in commodity prices, including NGL and sulfur prices, would reduce the results for the gas processing business. 32OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITYSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Segment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and income from the segments’ equity investments.

Please refer to “Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (unaudited)” for additional information on oil and gas production and sales. Average daily production volumes from ongoing operations increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to 264 MBOE/d in acquired production from the Acquisition, including 120 MBOE/d in DJ Basin, 58 MBOE/d in the Gulf of Mexico and 63 MBOE/d in the Delaware Basin, as well as an increase of 78 MBOE/d in the legacy Occidental Permian Resources operations as a result of increased drilling and well productivity.Average daily production volumes from ongoing operations increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher Permian Resources production which increased by 52% from the prior year, due to developmental drilling activity and improved well performance. Lease operating expenseThe following table sets forth the average lease operating expense per BOE from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019: 2019 2018 2017Average lease operating expense per BOE $9.19 $11.52 $11.20 Average lease operating expense per BOE, decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to operational efficiencies related to maintenance and support cost. Combined 2019 Permian Resources lease operating expense per BOE, was $6.80 which represented a decrease of 6% from the prior year. Average lease operating costs per BOE, excluding taxes other than on income, increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to increased surface operations and maintenance costs. Permian Resources lease operating costs per BOE for 2018 decreased by 10% from the prior year, and the fourth quarter of 2018 costs were below $7.00 per BOE, due to continued improved operational efficiencies.OXY 2019 FORM 10-K35MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CHEMICAL SEGMENTmillions 2019 2018 2017Segment Sales $4,102 $4,657 $4,355Segment Results $799 $1,159 $822Chemical segment results decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower realized caustic soda prices and lower domestic demand across many product lines partially offset by favorable feedstock costs. The 2019 earnings also reflected fees received under a pipeline easement agreement that was executed during the first quarter of 2019. Chemical segment results increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to significant improvements in realized caustic soda pricing, strong margins and demand across many product lines and lower ethylene costs, slightly offset by decreased caustic soda export volumes. The 2018 earnings also benefited from the full-year equity contributions from the joint venture ethylene cracker in Ingleside, Texas, and additional earning contributions from the Geismar, Louisiana plant expansion to produce 4CPe.MARKETING AND MIDSTREAM SEGMENTmillions 2019 2018 2017Segment Sales $4,132 $3,656 $1,157Segment Results (a) $241 $2,802 $85 Items affecting comparability Asset and equity investment sale gains (b) $114 $907 $94Asset impairments and other charges(c) $(1,002) $— $(120)Interest rate swaps MTM, net(d) $30 $— $—(a) Results include items affecting comparability listed below, as well as WES segment results from August 8, 2019 to December 31, 2019 of $541 million.(b) The 2019 amount represented a $114 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Plains GP Holdings, L.P.

Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, Occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate for 2019 would be 36%. The increase in worldwide effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to the 2017 remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities to the new federal corporate income tax rate. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSREVENUE AND OTHER INCOME ITEMSmillions 2019 2018 2017Net sales $20,393 $17,824 $12,508Interest, dividends and other income $217 $136 $99Gain on sale of equity investments and other assets, net $622 $974 $667Price and volume changes generally represent the majority of the change in the oil and gas and chemical segments sales. Marketing and midstream sales are mainly impacted by the change in the Midland-to-Gulf Coast spread for the marketing business and, to a lesser extent, the change in NGL and sulfur prices for the gas processing business.The increase in net sales in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher domestic volumes related to the Acquisition, which added approximately $3.5 billion in net sales as well as increased production activity in Occidental’s Permian Resources operations, partially offset by oil, NGL and natural gas prices in the oil and gas segment and lower realized caustic soda prices in the chemical segment. The increase in net sales in 2018 compared to 2017 was mainly due to higher oil prices and higher domestic oil volumes, as well as higher marketing margins in the marketing and midstream segment due to improved Midland-to-Gulf Coast spreads and higher realized caustic soda prices in the chemical segment. Average worldwide realized oil prices rose approximately 24% from 2017 to 2018.The 2019 gain on sale included a net gain of $475 million related to Occidental’s Midland Basin joint venture with Ecopetrol and sale of real estate assets and $114 million from the sale of Occidental’s remaining equity investment in Plains. The 2018 gain on sale included the sale of non-core domestic midstream assets including the Centurion common carrier pipeline and storage system, Southeast New Mexico oil gathering system, and Ingleside Crude Terminal of $907 million. The 2017 gain on sale included the sale of South Texas and non-core proved and unproved Permian acreage.

TRANSPORTATION EXPENSETransportation expense increased in 2019 from the prior year, primarily due to increased oil sales volumes, mainly driven by added production and the fulfillment of additional capacity commitments related to the Acquisition. Transportation expense decreased in 2018 from the prior year due to the 2018 sale of the Centurion Pipeline common carrier oil pipeline and storage system and the Ingleside Crude Terminal.CHEMICAL AND MIDSTREAM COST OF SALESChemical and midstream cost of sales decreased slightly in 2019 from the prior year, primarily due to favorable raw material costs in the chemical segment, partially offset by an increase in midstream operation costs due to WES.Chemical and midstream cost of sales decreased slightly in 2018 from the prior year, primarily due to lower gas plant and maintenance expenses in the midstream segment. PURCHASED COMMODITIESPurchased commodities included purchased oil volumes for which Occidental does not act as agent. Several of these oil purchase agreements commenced in mid-year 2018. The increase in 2019 from the prior year is due to a full year of purchases under these contracts, which are used to ensure the full utilization of committed transportation capacity in the marketing business. Similarly, the purchased oil volumes for contracts effective in late 2017 but in effect for the full year of 2018 caused the increase between those years. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVESelling, general and administrative expense increased in 2019 from the prior year, primarily due to higher employee costs related to the Acquisition.Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2018 from the prior year due to higher compensation costs. OTHER OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING EXPENSEOther operating and non-operating expense increased in 2019 from the prior year, primarily due to higher overhead oil and gas engineering costs related to the Acquisition.Other operating and non-operating expense increased in 2018 from the prior year, primarily due to higher environmental costs.TAXES OTHER THAN ON INCOME Taxes other than on income in 2019 increased from the prior year, primarily due to production taxes on higher oil, NGL and natural gas volumes as well as additional ad valorem tax related to the Acquisition. Taxes other than on income increased in 2018 from the prior year, primarily due to higher production taxes, which are directly tied to higher commodity prices. 38OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATIONDD&A expense increased in 2019 from prior year, primarily due to increased production related to the Acquisition. DD&A expense decreased slightly in 2018 from the prior year due to lower domestic DD&A rates due to higher reserves partially offset by higher production volumes and higher DD&A rates in the Middle East.ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER CHARGESAsset impairments and other charges are primarily related to a $1 billion loss on the December 31, 2019 loss of control of WES. In addition, Occidental incurred impairment charges of approximately $285 million related to domestic undeveloped mineral leases that were set to expire in the near term, where Occidental had no plans to pursue exploration activities, and $39 million related to early termination of its Qatar ISSD contract.In 2018, Occidental incurred impairment and other charges of approximately $416 million on proved oil and gas properties and inventory in Qatar due to the decline in oil prices. Also in 2018, the marketing and midstream segment incurred approximately $100 million of charges primarily for lower of cost or market adjustments on its crude inventory and line fill.In 2017, Occidental incurred impairment and other charges of $545 million, of which $397 million related to proved and unproved non-core Permian acreage and $120 million for idled marketing and midstream assets. ANADARKO ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTSIn 2019, Occidental had the following charges related to the Acquisition: employee severance and related cost of $1 billion; licensing fees for critical seismic data of $401 million; and $213 million for bank, legal and consulting fees. Estimated acquisition-related charges of approximately $1.3 billion that were mostly accrued in 2019 are expected to be mostly paid in 2020.INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE, NETInterest and debt expense, net, increased in 2019 from the prior year due to an increase in debt issued to partially fund the Acquisition, as well as the debt assumed through the Acquisition. Interest and debt expense, net, remained relatively consistent between 2018 and 2017 experiencing a small increase in interest paid on debt due to the addition of $1 billion in senior notes. OTHER ITEMSIncome/(expense) millions 2019 2018 2017Income tax expense $(693) $(1,477) $(17)Income from equity investments $373 $331 $357Discontinued operations, net $(15) $— $—INCOME TAX EXPENSEIncome tax expense decreased in 2019 from the prior year, primarily due to lower pre-tax income, partially offset by charges related to the loss of control of WES and acquisition-related costs for which Occidental did not receive a tax benefit.Income tax expense increased in 2018 from the prior year, primarily due to Tax Reform in 2017 and higher pre-tax income in 2018. Occidental recorded an income tax benefit in 2017 due to the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of the corporate tax rate reduction enacted as part of Tax Reform, partially offset by higher pre-tax operating income as a result of a recovery in commodity prices. OXY 2019 FORM 10-K39MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESAt December 31, 2019, Occidental had approximately $3.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents. A substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the United States. At December 31, 2019, Occidental had $0.5 billion in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, which was primarily associated with a benefits trust for former Anadarko employees that was funded as part of the Acquisition. Restricted cash within the benefits trust will be made available to Occidental as benefits are paid to former Anadarko employees. DEBT ACTIVITYIn August 2019, Occidental issued $13.0 billion of new senior unsecured notes, consisting of both floating and fixed rate debt. Occidental also borrowed under the Term Loans, which consisted of: (1) a 364-day senior unsecured variable-rate term loan tranche of $4.4 billion and (2) a two-year senior unsecured variable-rate term loan tranche of $4.4 billion. In total, the $21.8 billion in debt issued was used to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition. Through the Acquisition, Occidental assumed Anadarko debt with an outstanding principal balance of $11.9 billion. In 2019, Occidental paid approximately $7.0 billion of long-term debt including a majority of the Term Loans using proceeds from assets sales and available cash. On June 3, 2019, Occidental entered into an amendment to its existing $3.0 billion revolving credit facility (Occidental RCF) pursuant to which, among other things, the commitments under the Occidental RCF were increased to $5.0 billion at the closing of the Acquisition. Borrowings under the Occidental RCF bear interest at various benchmark rates, including London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin based on Occidental’s senior debt-ratings. The facility has similar terms to other debt agreements and does not contain material adverse change clauses or debt ratings triggers that could restrict Occidental’s ability to borrow, or that would permit lenders to terminate their commitments or accelerate debt repayment. The facility provides for the termination of loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur. Occidental has not drawn down any amounts under the Occidental RCF. As of December 31, 2019, under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock. With a continued focus on capital and operational efficiencies, Occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs, including future dividend payments, through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, monetization of non-core assets or investments and, if necessary, proceeds from other forms of capital issuance.CASH FLOW ANALYSISCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIESmillions 2019 2018 2017Operating cash flow from continuing operations $7,203 $7,669 $4,861Operating cash flow from discontinued operations, net of taxes 172 — —Net cash provided by operating activities $7,375 $7,669 $4,861Cash provided by operating activities decreased $294 million in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting Acquisition related costs, higher interest expense, and slightly lower oil prices, which were partially offset by a 92% increase in domestic production volumes. Cash provided by operating activities increased $2.8 billion in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting higher realized worldwide oil and NGL prices, which increased by 24% and 21%, respectively, as well as a 25% increase in domestic oil volumes. Operating cash flows in 2018 also benefited from higher marketing margins in the marketing and midstream segment due to improved Midland-to-Gulf Coast spreads and higher chemical margins from significant improvements in caustic soda prices. 40OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIESmillions 2019 2018 2017Capital expenditures Oil and Gas $(5,500) $(4,413) $(2,945)Chemical (267) (271) (308)Marketing and Midstream(a) (461) (216) (284)Corporate (127) (75) (62)Total $(6,355) $(4,975) $(3,599)Purchase of businesses and assets, net (28,088) (928) (1,064)Proceeds from sale of assets and equity investments, net 6,143 2,824 1,403Other investing activities, net (573) (127) 181Investing cash flows from continuing operations $(28,873) $(3,206) $(3,079)Investing cash flows from discontinued operations (154) — —Net cash used by investing activities $(29,027) $(3,206) $(3,079)(a) Included $365 million related to WES in 2019.The increase in cash flows used by investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily reflected the cash portion of the Acquisition consideration, partially offset by the cash acquired. In 2019, proceeds from the sale of assets and equity investments, net, included the sale of Mozambique LNG assets, the Ecopetrol joint venture, the equity investment in Plains and real estate assets. Occidental’s capital expenditures increased by $1.4 billion in 2019, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily related to the Permian Basin due to its high returns of legacy operations coupled with the addition of assets through the Acquisition in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin and Gulf of Mexico. Occidental’s 2020 capital spending is expected to be $5.3 billion.The increase in cash flows used by investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was a result of additional capital spending, primarily in the Permian Basin due to its high returns. In 2018, proceeds from sale of assets and equity investments, net related to the sale of non-core domestic midstream assets, partially offset by purchases of businesses and assets, net related to the acquisition of a previously leased power and steam cogeneration plant.CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY FINANCING ACTIVITIESmillions 2019 2018 2017Net cash provided (used) by financing activities $22,193 $(3,102) $(2,343)Cash provided by financing activities in 2019 increased $25.3 billion, compared to 2018, primarily due to net proceeds from long-term debt of $21.6 billion and the issuance of $10.0 billion of preferred shares with a warrant used to fund the Acquisition. These proceeds were partially offset by debt payments of $7.0 billion and dividends on common stock of $2.6 billion. OXY 2019 FORM 10-K41MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSGUARANTEESOccidental has guaranteed its portion of the debt of Dolphin Energy, an equity method investment, and has entered into various other guarantees, including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations. See “Oil and Gas Segment — Business Review — Qatar” and “Segment Results of Operations” for further information about Dolphin. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, Occidental had provided limited recourse guarantees on approximately $242 million and $244 million, respectively, of Dolphin Energy’s debt, which are limited to certain political and other events.COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS DELIVERY COMMITMENTSOccidental has made commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, natural gas and NGL. The total amount contracted to be delivered in the United States is approximately 158 million barrels of oil through 2025, 1,346 Bcf of gas through 2035 and 660 million barrels of NGL through 2035. The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product. Occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe following table summarizes and cross-references Occidental’s contractual obligations, and indicates on- and off-balance sheet obligations as of December 31, 2019:millions Payments Due by YearTotal 2020 2021 and 2022 2023 and 2024 2025 and thereafterOn-Balance Sheet Long-term debt (Note 7) (a)$37,401 $— $11,096 $5,111 $21,194Leases (Note 8) (b)2,018 608630 251 529Asset retirement obligations (Note 1)4,633 247 271 799 3,316Other long-term liabilities (c)3,765 1,054 513 490 1,708Off-Balance Sheet Purchase obligations (d)20,712 3,252 5,704 4,660 7,096Total$68,529 $5,161 $18,214 $11,311 $33,843(a) Excluded unamortized debt discount and interest on the debt. As of December 31, 2019, interest on long-term debt totaling $18.1 billion is payable in the following years: 2020 - $1.5 billion, 2021 and 2022 - $2.6 billion, 2023 and 2024 - $2.1 billion, 2025 and thereafter - $11.9 billion.(b) Occidental is the lessee under various agreements for real estate, equipment, plants and facilities. See Note 2 - Accounting and Disclosure Changes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the impact of rules effective January 1, 2019 which require Occidental to recognize most leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet.(c) Included obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans, accrued transportation commitments, severance and change of control obligations related to the Acquisition and other accrued liabilities.(d) Amounts included payments which will become due under long-term agreements to purchase goods and services used in the normal course of business to secure terminal, pipeline and processing capacity, CO2, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. In 2019, Occidental added $7.7 billion of additional long-term commitments as a result of the loss of control of WES. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable. Long-term purchase contracts are discounted at a 3.89% discount rate. 42OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES LEGAL MATTERSOccidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief. Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief. Usually Occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for matters, other than for environmental remediation, that satisfy this criteria as of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, were not material to Occidental’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.On May 30, 2019, a complaint was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported Occidental stockholders High River Limited Partnership, Icahn Partners Master Fund LP and Icahn Partners LP (the “Icahn Complainants”), captioned High River Ltd. P’ship v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., C.A. No. 2019-0403-JRS, seeking inspection of Occidental’s books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In the complaint, the Icahn Complainants noted that they had accumulated over $1.6 billion of Occidental Common Stock. On June 14, 2019, Occidental filed an answer to the complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. A trial was held on September 20, 2019, and the court dismissed the Icahn Complaint. The Icahn Complainants appealed and oral arguments occurred in February 2020.In 2016, Occidental received payments from the Republic of Ecuador of approximately $1.0 billion pursuant to a November 2015 arbitration award for Ecuador’s 2006 expropriation of Occidental’s Participation Contract for Block 15. The awarded amount represented a recovery of 60% of the value of Block 15. In 2017, Andes Petroleum Ecuador Ltd. (Andes) filed a demand for arbitration, claiming it is entitled to a 40% share of the judgment amount obtained by Occidental. Occidental contends that Andes is not entitled to any of the amounts paid under the 2015 arbitration award because Occidental’s recovery was limited to Occidental’s own 60% economic interest in the block. The merits hearing is scheduled for May 2020. Occidental intends to vigorously defend against this claim in arbitration. The ultimate outcome and impact of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings on Occidental cannot be predicted. Management believes that the resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Occidental’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. If unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur, future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected. Occidental’s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available. TAX MATTERSDuring the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years through 2016 for U.S. federal income tax purposes have been audited by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program and subsequent taxable years are currently under review. Taxable years through 2009 have been audited for state income tax purposes. While a single foreign tax jurisdiction is open for 2002, all other significant audit matters in foreign jurisdictions have been resolved through 2010. During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.For Anadarko, its taxable years through 2016 for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes have been audited by the IRS and respective state taxing authorities. There are outstanding significant audit matters in one foreign jurisdiction. During the course of the tax audit, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. Other than the matter discussed below, Occidental believes that the resolution of these outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.Anadarko received an $881 million tentative refund in 2016 related to its $5.2 billion Tronox settlement payment in 2015. In September 2018, Anadarko received a statutory notice of deficiency from the IRS disallowing the net operating loss carryback and rejecting Anadarko’s refund claim. As a result, Anadarko filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court to dispute the disallowances in November 2018. The case is currently in the IRS appeals process. If the matter is not resolved in the IRS appeals process, Occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution in the U.S. Tax Court. While Occidental believes it is entitled to this refund, in accordance with ASC 740’s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions, as of December 31, 2019, Occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund of OXY 2019 FORM 10-K43MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS $881 million. As a result, should Occidental not ultimately prevail on the issue, there would be no additional tax expense recorded for financial statement purposes other than future interest. However, in that event Occidental would be required to repay approximately $925 million ($898 million federal and $27 million in state taxes) plus accrued interest of approximately $189 million. As a result, a liability for this amount has been recorded in deferred credits and other liabilities - other at December 31, 2019. INDEMNITIES TO THIRD PARTIESOccidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2019, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES Occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality. The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and international laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites. Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems. The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs. ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATIONAs of December 31, 2019, Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 177 sites, which included 36 sites assumed through the Acquisition. The following table presents Occidental’s current and non-current environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($162 million in 2019 and $120 million in 2018) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities - environmental remediation liabilities ($1.04 billion in 2019 and $762 million in 2018). Occidental continues to evaluate the remediation obligations assumed through the Acquisition.Occidental’s environmental remediation sites are grouped into four categories: National Priorities List (NPL) sites listed or proposed for listing by the EPA on the CERCLA NPL and three categories of non-NPL sites — third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites. 2019 2018millions, except number of sites Number of Sites Remediation Balance Number of Sites Remediation BalanceNPL sites 36 $463 34 $458Third-party sites 74 311 68 168Occidental-operated sites 17 154 14 115Closed or non-operated Occidental sites 50 269 29 141Total 177 $1,197 145 $882 As of December 31, 2019, Occidental’s environmental remediation liabilities exceeded $10 million each at 20 of the 177 sites described above, and 101 of the sites had liabilities from $0 to $1 million each. As of December 31, 2019, three sites — the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and a former chemical plant in Ohio (both of which are indemnified by Maxus Energy Corporation, as discussed further below) and a landfill in Western New York — accounted for 94 percent of its liabilities associated with NPL sites. Seventeen of the 36 NPL sites are indemnified by Maxus. Six of the 74 third-party sites — a Maxus-indemnified chrome site in New Jersey, a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, a former oil field, a landfill and a chemical plant in California, and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities — accounted for 75 percent of Occidental’s liabilities associated with these sites. Nine of the 74 third-party sites are indemnified by Maxus.Five sites — oil and gas operations in Colorado and chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, New York and Texas — accounted for 67 percent of the liabilities associated with the Occidental-operated sites.44OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Six other sites — a landfill in Western New York, a former refinery in Oklahoma, former chemical plants in California, Tennessee and Washington, and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania — accounted for 64 percent of the liabilities associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.Environmental remediation liabilities vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or dispositions, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation. Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40 percent of the year end remediation balance over the next three to four years with the remainder over the subsequent 10 or more years. Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those amounts currently recorded for environmental remediation for all of its environmental sites could be up to $1.1 billion. MAXUS ENVIRONMENTAL SITESWhen Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus, a subsidiary of YPF S.A. (YPF), agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site (Site) along a portion of the Passaic River. On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware. Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Site.In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River. The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay. During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus’s bankruptcy filing, Occidental and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD at an estimated cost of $165 million. The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties. Occidental has accrued a remediation liability relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and the remediation called for in the AOC and the ROD, as well as for certain other Maxus-indemnified sites. Occidental’s accrued estimated environmental remediation liability does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs. Occidental’s ultimate share of the estimated costs may be higher or lower than its accrued remediation liability, and is subject to final design plans and the resolution with other potentially responsible parties. Occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD and to perform remediation at other Maxus-indemnified sites in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties. In June 2018, Occidental filed a complaint under CERCLA in Federal District Court in the State of New Jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties for reimbursement of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD or to perform other remediation activities at the Site. In June 2017, the court overseeing the Maxus bankruptcy approved a Plan of Liquidation (Plan) to liquidate Maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against YPF, Repsol and others to satisfy claims by Occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs. In July 2017, the court-approved Plan became final and the trust became effective. Among other responsibilities, the trust will pursue claims against YPF, Repsol and others and distribute assets to Maxus’ creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and Plan. In June 2018, the trust filed its complaint against YPF and Repsol in Delaware bankruptcy court asserting claims based upon, among other things, fraudulent transfer and alter ego. On February 15, 2019, the bankruptcy court denied Repsol’s and YPF’s motions to dismiss the complaint.

Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts. The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management’s judgment. OIL AND GAS PROPERTIESThe carrying value of Occidental’s property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations (AROs) and capitalized interest, net of DD&A and any impairment charges. For assets acquired in a business combination, PP&E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date. Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. For exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and operating viability of the project. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether Occidental is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production, and geological, geophysical and seismic costs as incurred.Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method. It amortizes acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether 46OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.Several factors could change Occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves. For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit. Occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Overall, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices. In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental’s control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves. Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded. Additionally, Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable. If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management’s plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment. Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period. Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants. The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time. These assumptions include estimates of future production, product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs. It is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments.For impairment testing, unless prices are contractually fixed, Occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows. Future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves. Market prices for oil, natural gas and NGL have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Changes in global supply and demand, transportation capacity, currency exchange rates, and applicable laws and regulations, and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts. Future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly. The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental’s oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD&A rate. For example, a 5% increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD&A rate by approximately $1.15 per barrel, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $415 million annually at current production rates. A portion of the carrying value of Occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $29.5 billion at December 31, 2019, and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2018. The 2019 amount is primarily related to the Acquisition. The unproved amounts are not subject to DD&A until they are classified as proved properties. Individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms, success rates, and other factors. If the exploration efforts are unsuccessful, or management decides not to pursue development of these properties as a result of lower commodity prices, higher development and operating costs, contractual conditions or other factors, the capitalized costs of the related properties would be expensed. The timing of any writedowns of these unproved properties, if warranted, depends upon management’s plans, the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental periodically reviews unproved properties for impairments; numerous factors are considered, including but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property, geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining lease term for the property. Management’s assessment of the availability of funds for future activities and the current and projected political and regulatory climate in areas in which Occidental operates also impacts the timing of any impairment. PROVED RESERVESOccidental estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC and FASB. This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Occidental’s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting OXY 2019 FORM 10-K47MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS and processing the hydrocarbons. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. FAIR VALUES Occidental estimates fair-value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets and initial measurements of AROs. Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value.Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs. When estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, Occidental must apply various assumptions. FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIESOccidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods: Ø Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date. These derivatives are classified as Level 1. ØOver-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, international exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. ØOccidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. ØOccidental values debt using market-observable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets. For debt instruments that are not traded, the fair value is determined by interpolating the value based on debt with similar terms and credit risk. NON-FINANCIAL ASSETSOccidental uses market-observable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued. When Occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions. The cost approach is based on management’s best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management’s best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows, and the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment, and the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of management’s control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant’s view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company’s business plans and investment decisions. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURESEnvironmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Occidental records environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements. Occidental bases its environmental remediation liabilities on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably 48OXY 2019 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS expected to achieve the remedial objective. Occidental periodically reviews its environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available. Occidental records environmental remediation liabilities on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established. The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established. Presently none of its environmental remediation liabilities are recorded on a discounted basis. Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable. Many factors could affect Occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses. The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental’s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur. Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs. In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental’s ultimate share of liability. Occidental records its environmental remediation liabilities at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at CERCLA NPL sites, Occidental’s environmental remediation liabilities include management’s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems. If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its liabilities accordingly. If Occidental were to adjust the balance of its environmental remediation liabilities based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings. For example, if the balance were reduced by 10%, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $120 million. If the balance were increased by 10%, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $120 million. INCOME TAXES Occidental files various U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns. The impact of changes in tax regulations are reflected when enacted. In general, deferred federal, state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Occidental routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. If Occidental concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Occidental recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense (benefit). Occidental uses the flow-through method to account for its investment tax credits. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.LOSS CONTINGENCIESOccidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits. Occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Management’s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management’s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors. See “Lawsuits, Claims and Contingencies” for additional information.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES See Note 2 - Accounting and Disclosure Changes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.OXY 2019 FORM 10-K49MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATA Portions of this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects. Words such as “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “aim,” “goal,” “target,” “objective,” “likely” or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, except as required by law. Factors that may cause Occidental’s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations include the factors discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISKGENERALOccidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices. Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental’s pre-tax annual income by approximately $260 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $90 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.50 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental’s pre-tax income of approximately $185 million. These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental’s results to prices also will change. Marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil, natural gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities. These sensitivities are additionally dependent on marketing volumes and cannot be predicted reliably.Occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices. A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively. A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $30 million. Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins. Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas. RISK MANAGEMENTOccidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies. The controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check. Members of the risk management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer. Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, reporting to senior management on various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls. FAIR VALUE OF MARKETING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTSOccidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value. Fair values for these contracts are derived from Level 1 and Level 2 sources. The fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant. The following table shows the fair value of Occidental’s derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation: Maturity Periods Source of Fair Value Assets/(Liabilities)millions 2020 2021 and 2022 2023 and 2024 2025 and thereafter TotalPrices actively quoted $(63) $— $— $— $(63)Prices provided by other external sources 36 8 1 1 46Total $(27) $8 $1 $1 $(17) 50OXY 2019 FORM 10-KQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES CASH-FLOW HEDGESOccidental’s marketing operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased from third parties at Occidental’s North American leased storage facilities. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, Occidental had approximately 6 Bcf and 5 Bcf of natural gas held in storage, respectively, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sales, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 3 Bcf and 4 Bcf of stored natural gas, respectively. QUANTITATIVE INFORMATIONOccidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities. This measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95% level of confidence. Additionally, Occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice. As a result of these controls, Occidental believes that the market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance. INTEREST RATE RISKGENERALOccidental acquired interest rate swap contracts in the Acquisition. Occidental pays a fixed interest rate and receives a floating interest rate indexed to three-month LIBOR. The swaps have an initial term of 30 years with mandatory termination dates in September 2020 through 2023 and a total notional amount of $1.475 billion as of December 31, 2019. In October 2019, $125 million of notional interest rate swaps were terminated. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the swaps of negative $1.4 billion net liability was offset by $104 million in posted cash collateral, resulting in a net $1.3 billion liability. A 25-basis point decrease in implied LIBOR rates over the term of the swaps would result in an additional liability of approximately $101 million on these swaps. In January and February 2020, Occidental extended September 2020 mandatory termination dates to September 2021 and September 2022 for swaps with a notional value of $500 million and $150 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, Occidental had $4.5 billion of variable-rate debt outstanding. A 25-basis point increase in LIBOR interest rates would increase gross interest expense approximately $11 million per year.As of December 31, 2019, Occidental had $34.3 billion of fixed-rate debt outstanding. A 25-basis point change in Treasury rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt approximately $680 million.TABULAR PRESENTATION OF INTEREST RATE RISKThe table below provides information about Occidental’s debt obligations.

Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes. A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars. Additionally, all of Occidental’s consolidated international oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was immaterial. The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.OXY 2019 FORM 10-K51QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES CREDIT RISKThe majority of Occidental’s counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments. Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate. Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits, and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. Occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis. Certain over-the-counter derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each party would need to post. The aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-contingent features for which a net liability position existed at December 31, 2019 was $787 million (net of $169 million collateral), primarily related to acquired interest-rate swaps, and $68 million (net of $1 million of collateral) existed at December 31, 2018.As of December 31, 2019, the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties. Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2019, was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS HELD FOR NON-TRADING PURPOSESAs of December 31, 2019, Occidental had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future oil production of 350 thousand barrels per day. As of December 31, 2019, these derivative instruments were at a $68 million net derivative liability position.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8 and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Part 1, Item 1A.INDEXPAGECurrent Business Outlook and Strategy20Oil and Gas Segment23Chemical Segment32Midstream and Marketing Segment33Segment Results of Operations and Items Affecting Comparability35Income Taxes38Consolidated Results of Operations39Liquidity and Capital Resources42Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements43Commitments and Obligations43Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies44Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures46Global Investments48Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates48Significant Accounting and Disclosure Changes52Safe Harbor Discussion Regarding Outlook and Other Forward-Looking Data52OXY 2020 FORM 10-K19MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND STRATEGYGENERALOccidental’s operations, financial condition, cash flows and levels of expenditures are highly dependent on oil prices and, to a lesser extent, NGL and natural gas prices, the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads and the prices it receives for its chemical products. The worldwide economy has been severely impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began during the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter, travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders were implemented for much of the world to limit the spread of COVID-19. Though certain restrictions have been lifted, some areas have recently reinstated stay at home orders and oil and gas demand remains below pre-pandemic levels. On April 12, 2020, certain members of the OPEC and 10 non-OPEC partner countries (OPEC+) agreed to production cuts intended to mitigate the oil supply and demand imbalance to stabilize prices. On January 5, 2021, OPEC+ agreed to extend the cuts through March 2021. These production cuts coupled with declining U.S. production helped mitigate the supply and demand imbalance. While the spot WTI oil price has recovered to above $60.00/Bbl as of the date of this filing, the average daily WTI oil price fell from $57.03/Bbl in 2019 to $39.40/Bbl in 2020 or 31 percent. We expect that the oil supply and demand balance and consequently oil prices in the near-term will continue to be influenced by the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic; the effectiveness and pace of the distribution of the recently approved vaccines; and OPEC+ and U.S. production levels. LIQUIDITYIn response to the dramatic drop in oil prices and the current macroeconomic environment, Occidental has taken significant measures to increase its near and mid-term liquidity and address near-term debt maturities. Specifically, during 2020 Occidental:■Reduced its 2020 capital budget to $2.6 billion from a range of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, a midpoint reduction of approximately 50%;■Made significant cuts to its 2020 operating and corporate costs. On an annualized basis, Occidental has realized $1.5 billion of overhead savings and over $900 million in operating cost savings, of which a majority is expected to remain permanent in future years;■Reduced the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.01 per share from $0.79 per share, effective July 2020, which on an annualized basis, will reduce its common stock dividend outlay by approximately $2.9 billion;■Elected to pay the preferred stock dividend paid in the second and third quarters of 2020 in the form of shares of common stock, in lieu of cash, preserving $400 million of liquidity. Occidental elected to pay the dividend paid in the fourth quarter in cash. The Board of Directors will continue to assess market conditions and Occidental's financial condition on a quarterly basis to determine whether the preferred stock dividend will be paid in shares of stock, in cash or a combination of shares of common stock and cash;■Entered into a new receivable securitization facility that provides additional liquidity of up to $400 million;■Issued $7.0 billion in senior unsecured notes (the Senior Notes Offerings) during 2020 to extend certain debt maturities in 2021-2023 to 2025-2031;■Since the Acquisition, completed significant asset divestitures for net proceeds of approximately $8.2 billion;■Used the net proceeds from asset sales, cash on hand and Senior Notes Offerings to retire or tender $6.0 billion of 2021, $2.7 billion of 2022 and $264 million of 2023 maturities; and■Exchanged approximately 27.9 million WES common units to retire a $260 million note payable to WES due 2038.In 2019, Occidental entered into three-way oil collar and call derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to commodity price risk and increase the predictability of near-term cash flows. The majority of the collars settled in 2020 with the receipt of cash of $960 million. The remaining $52 million settled in 2021. See Note 9 - Derivatives in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Occidental believes the actions outlined above enhance its liquidity position to fund its operations. Occidental will continue to evaluate the economic environment, as well as the commodity price environment, and may make further adjustments to its future levels of expenditures and operating and corporate costs. However, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Occidental's results of operations, cash flows and financial position are unknown, and those impacts could be material. Additionally, actions taken in response to the current macro-environment may result in the long-term reduction of its capital expenditure and production profile. DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAPSWith the completion of the liquidity measures above, as of the date of this filing, Occidental has debt maturities of approximately $371 million in 2021, $2.1 billion in 2022 and $0.9 billion in 2023. Occidental’s $2.3 billion Zero Coupon senior notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons) can be put to Occidental in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons. An immaterial amount was put 20OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISto Occidental in 2020. The Zero Coupons can next be put to Occidental in October 2021, which, if put in whole, would require a payment of approximately $1.0 billion at such date. Occidental currently has the intent and ability to meet this obligation, including, if necessary, using amounts available under the revolving credit facility (RCF) should the put right be exercised. Interest rate swaps with a notional value of $750 million and fair value of $894 million, as of December 31, 2020, have mandatory termination dates in September 2021. Interest rate swaps with a notional value of $725 million and fair value of $876 million, as of December 31, 2020, have mandatory termination dates in September 2022 and 2023. The interest rate swaps fair value, and cash required to settle them on their termination dates, will continue to fluctuate with changes in interest rates through the mandatory termination dates. As of December 31, 2020, Occidental had approximately $2.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of the date of this filing, $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity under its existing RCF, which matures in 2023. Occidental continues to pursue divestitures of certain assets and intends to use the net proceeds from asset sales and excess free cash flow to repay its nearer-term debt maturities, but the expected timing and final proceeds from such asset sales are uncertain. Occidental currently expects its cash on hand and funds available under its RCF to be sufficient to meet its debt maturities, operating expenditures and other obligations for the next 12 months from the date of this filing. However, given the inherent uncertainty associated with the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting impact on oil demand, Occidental may need to raise capital to fund its operations and refinance debt maturities.DEBT RATINGSIn connection with the Senior Notes Offerings, Occidental's long-term debt credit ratings were reviewed by the three major rating agencies. As of December 31, 2020, Occidental’s long-term debt was rated BB by Fitch Ratings, Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service and BB- by Standard and Poor’s. Any additional downgrade in credit ratings could impact Occidental's ability to access capital markets and increase its cost of capital. In addition, given that Occidental’s current debt ratings are non-investment grade, Occidental may be requested, and in some cases required, to provide collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit, surety bonds or other acceptable support as financial assurance of its performance and payment obligations under certain contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts, environmental remediation obligations, oil and gas purchase contracts and certain derivative instruments.As of the date of this filing, Occidental has provided required financial assurances through a combination of cash, letters of credit and surety bonds and has not issued any letters of credit under the RCF or other committed facilities. For additional information, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC TO GLOBAL OPERATIONSOccidental is focused on protecting the health and safety of its employees and contractors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Occidental has implemented workplace restrictions in our offices and work sites for health and safety reasons. Occidental has not incurred material costs as a result of new protocols and procedures. Occidental continues to monitor national, state and local government directives where Occidental has operations and/or offices. While Occidental has not incurred any significant disruptions to its day-to-day operations as a result of any workplace restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic to date, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain.RECENT GOVERNMENTAL RULE MAKING AND EXECUTIVE ORDERSIn January 2021, the COGCC adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or “setbacks” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures. Pursuant to the regulations, well pads cannot be located within 500 feet of an occupied structure without the consent of the property owner. As part of the permitting process, the COGCC will consider a series of siting requirements for all drilling locations located between 500 feet and 2,000 feet of an occupied structure. Alternatively, the operator may seek a waiver from each owner and tenant within the designated distance. While Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these regulations on its business, at this time, Occidental does not anticipate significant near-term changes to our development program in the DJ Basin based on these regulations. However, as a result certain of Occidental’s PUD reserves have been derecognized as they no longer meet the regulatory certainty criteria to be considered proved reserves. Occidental’s ability to reestablish previously derecognized PUD reserves, as well as establishing new PUD locations will depend upon Occidental establishing a history of obtaining drilling permits under the new regulations and thus meeting the SEC’s “reasonably certain” threshold for adding PUD reserves. Occidental currently believes it will be able to successfully navigate the new setback guidelines.An executive order was issued in January 2021, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, that mandated an indefinite pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands, onshore and offshore, while a comprehensive review of oil and gas permitting and leasing is conducted by the U.S. Department of the Interior. In conducting this review, the Secretary of the Interior shall consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs.In addition, effective January 20, 2021, the Department of the Interior issued an order temporarily elevating the decision-making approval previously delegated to the Department of the Interior’s agencies and bureaus, including the BOEM and the BLM, to issue any onshore and offshore fossil fuel authorization for, including but not limited to a lease, OXY 2020 FORM 10-K21MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISamendment to a lease, affirmative extension of a lease, contract or other agreement or permit to drill to the leadership of the Department of the Interior.Neither of these orders impact existing operations or permits for ongoing operations under valid leases and does not preclude the issuances of leases, permits and other authorizations. Both of these orders align with the new governmental administration’s commitment to addressing climate change, specifically both orders allow for the Department of the Interior to consider potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on public lands or in offshore waters.Approximately 9% of Occidental’s onshore net acres are on federal lands while all of its Gulf of Mexico leases are in federal waters. Occidental is continuing to evaluate the overall impact of these new regulatory issuances on its oil and gas operations on federal leases and will reallocate capital to non-federal leases to the extent there are delays in obtaining permits and other authorizations that would alter the timing of development and exploration programs on federal leases. STRATEGYOccidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition with its combined integrated asset portfolio, continual enhancements to its organizational capability and commitment to implement innovative carbon management and storage solutions for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Occidental conducts its operations with a focus on sustainability, health, safety and environmental and social responsibility. Capital is employed to operate all assets in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of:■Maximizing capital efficiency to sustain fourth quarter 2020 production levels in order to maximize free cash flow;■Prioritizing projects to decrease its carbon footprint and create a business model to help other companies lower theirs;■Reducing financial leverage; and■Maintaining a robust liquidity position.KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORSOccidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success against key performance indicators that drive total stockholder return. In addition to efficient capital allocation and deployment discussed below in “Oil and Gas Segment - Business Strategy”, Occidental believes the following are its most significant performance indicators:SAFETY ■Injury Incidence Rate (IIR) and Days Away Restricted Transfer rate (DART) - Occidental’s combined employee and contractor IIR is determined by multiplying the total number of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable injuries and illnesses by 200,000 and dividing that result by the total number of hours worked by all employees and contractors. The DART rate is calculated in the same manner as IIR, but uses the number of incidents that resulted in days away from work, job transfer, or restricted job duties instead of the number of recordable injuries or illnesses.OPERATIONAL■Annual cost synergies - Post Acquisition, Occidental has focused on an annualized reduction in overhead and operating expense strategies from the historical amounts of Occidental and Anadarko, and exceeded its initial goal of at least $1.1 billion by realizing $2.3 billion in total synergies and additional cost savings on an annualized basis in 2020.■Total spend per barrel - In 2021, Occidental will focus on controlling total costs from a per-barrel perspective. Total spend per barrel is the sum of capital spending, general and administrative expenses, other operating and non-operating expenses and oil and gas lease operating costs divided by global oil, NGL and natural gas sales volumes.FINANCIAL■Cash returns on capital employed (CROCE) - CROCE is calculated as (i) the cash flows from operating activities, before changes in working capital, plus distributions from WES, divided by (ii) the average of the opening and closing balances of total equity plus total debt.■Reduce financial leverage.SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL■Advancing specific Carbon Capture, Use and Sequestration projects;■Net-zero operational and energy use emissions before 2040, with an ambition to achieve before 2035;■Net-zero total emissions inventory including product use with an ambition to achieve before 2050; and■Total carbon impact through carbon removal and storage technology and development past 2050.22OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOIL AND GAS SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYOccidental’s oil and gas segment focuses on long-term value creation and leadership in sustainability, health, safety and the environment. In each core operating area, Occidental’s operations benefit from scale, technical expertise, decades of high-margin inventory, environmental and safety leadership and commercial and governmental collaboration. These attributes allow Occidental to bring additional production quickly to market, extend the life of older fields at lower costs and provide low-cost returns-driven growth opportunities with advanced technology.With the completion of the Acquisition, Occidental became one of the largest U.S. producers of liquids, which includes oil, condensate and NGL, allowing Occidental to maximize cash margins on a Boe basis. Since the Acquisition, Occidental has focused on its divestiture program to divest of non-core assets to pay down near-term debt maturities, however, the advantages that Occidental’s portfolio provides, coupled with unmatched subsurface characterization ability and the proven ability to execute, ensures that Occidental is positioned for full-cycle success in the years ahead. The oil and gas segment has realized synergies to deliver lower breakeven costs and generate excess free cash flow. Since the Acquisition, Occidental completed the sale of significant non-core assets for net proceeds of approximately $8.2 billion.Despite the pandemic impacts on commodity prices and the overall economy as discussed above, Occidental’s assets are strategically positioned to provide a future portfolio of projects that are flexible and have short-cycle investment paybacks. Together with Occidental’s technical capabilities, the oil and gas segment strives to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize full-cycle value of the assets.The oil and gas business implements Occidental’s strategy primarily by:■Operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and optimizing capital intensity in core areas, primarily in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico, UAE, Oman and Algeria;■Maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach to capital expenditures with a focus on high-return, short-cycle, cash-flow-generating opportunities and an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing Occidental’s existing positions;■Focusing Occidental’s subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities, primarily in the Permian Basin;■Using EOR techniques, such as CO2, water and steam floods in mature fields; and■Focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies and innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions.In 2020, oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion and primarily focused on Occidental’s assets in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and Oman.OIL AND GAS PRICE ENVIRONMENTOil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance. The following table presents the average daily West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent prices for oil in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl) and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices for 2020 and 2019:20202019% ChangeWTI Oil ($/Bbl)$39.40 $57.03 (31)%Brent Oil ($/Bbl)$43.21 $64.18 (33)%NYMEX Natural Gas ($/Mcf)$2.11 $2.67 (21)%The following table presents Occidental’s average realized prices for continuing operations as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for 2020 and 2019:20202019Worldwide oil as a percentage of average WTI95 %99 %Worldwide oil as a percentage of average Brent (a)87 %88 %Worldwide NGL as a percentage of average WTI32 %30 %Worldwide NGL as a percentage of average Brent (a)29 %27 %Domestic natural gas as a percentage of NYMEX56 %49 %(a)Prior period percentages have been adjusted to reflect the Algeria operations as continuing operations.OXY 2020 FORM 10-K23MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISPrices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it difficult to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.As a result of the expected prolonged period of lower commodity prices brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on oil demand, Occidental tested substantially all of its oil and gas assets for impairment during the second quarter of 2020. Occidental recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $6.4 billion related to continuing operations and $2.2 billion related to discontinued operations for the three months ended June 30, 2020. While oil prices have modestly improved since the second quarter of 2020, if there was a worsening of the macroeconomic conditions caused by the impacts of COVID-19 and if such worsened condition was expected to be prolonged, Occidental’s oil and gas properties may be subject to further testing for impairment, which could result in additional non-cash asset impairments, and such impairments could be material to our financial statements. DOMESTIC INTERESTSBUSINESS REVIEWOccidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns, or a combination of both. Occidental’s domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to 10 years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences. Occidental has leasehold and mineral interests in 9.5 million net acres, of which approximately 52% is leased, 24% is owned subsurface mineral rights and 24% is owned land with mineral rights. The following chart shows Occidental’s domestic production volumes for the previous three years in thousand barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe) per day: 24OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDOMESTIC ASSETS (a)1. Powder River Basin2. DJ Basin3. Permian Basin4. Gulf of Mexico(a)Map represents geographic outlines of the respective basins.The Permian Basin The Permian Basin extends throughout West Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for more than 36% of total United States oil production in 2020. Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two business units: Permian Resources, which includes unconventional opportunities, and Permian EOR, which utilizes EOR techniques such as CO2 floods and waterfloods. Occidental has a leading position in the Permian Basin, producing approximately 13% of total oil in the basin. By exploiting the natural synergies between Permian Resources and Permian EOR, Occidental is able to deliver unique short- and long-term advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its Permian Basin operations. Permian Resources unconventional oil development projects provide very short-cycle investment payback, averaging less than two years, and generate some of the highest margin and returns of any oil and gas projects in the world. These investments contribute cash flow, while increasing long-term value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed. Occidental’s oil and gas operations in Permian Resources include approximately 1.6 million net acres. In 2020, new well design and flowback methods were implemented, which helped lower the overall well cost while improving recovery. Overall in 2020, Permian Resources produced approximately 435 Mboe/d from approximately 6,000 gross wells. Additionally in 2020, Permian Resources added 122 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) to Occidental’s proved reserves for improved recovery additions. The Permian Basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs, favorable CO2 flooding performance and the expansive CO2 transportation and processing infrastructure has resulted in decades of high-value enhanced oil production. With 34 active CO2 floods and over 40 years of experience, Occidental is the industry leader in Permian Basin CO2 flooding, which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10% to 25%. Technology improvements, such as the recent trend toward vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets, continue to yield more recovery from existing projects. Occidental’s share of production from Permian EOR was approximately 140 Mboe/d in 2020.Significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding Occidental’s existing CO2 projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been water-flooded. Permian EOR has a large inventory of future CO2 projects, which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions. In addition, OLCV continues making progress towards supplying anthropogenic, or man-made, CO2 for the purpose of carbon capture, utilization and storage in Occidental’s Permian EOR operations.In 2020, Occidental spent approximately $1.1 billion of capital in the Permian Basin, of which over 87% was spent on Permian Resources assets. Also in 2020, Occidental divested of certain non-core, largely non-operated acreage in the Permian Basin. In 2021, Occidental expects to allocate approximately 38% of its worldwide capital budget to the Permian Basin.OXY 2020 FORM 10-K25MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDJ BasinOccidental remains Colorado’s top oil and gas producer with interest in approximately 0.7 million net acres in Colorado. Production is derived from 2,500 operated vertical wells and 2,100 operated horizontal wells primarily focused in 460,000 net acres in the Niobrara and Codell formations. The DJ Basin provides competitive economics, low breakeven costs and free cash flow generation.Occidental produced approximately 293 Mboe/d in the DJ Basin in 2020. Horizontal drilling results in the field continue to be strong, with improved operational efficiencies in drilling and completions. In 2020, Occidental drilled 65 operated horizontal wells and completed 117 operated horizontal wells.Occidental is currently fully permitted for all planned 2021 completions activity and has received drilling permits for all planned drilling activity through the first half of 2021. New statewide regulations were adopted in the fourth quarter of 2020 and became effective in mid-January 2021. Occidental’s focus for 2021 is continuing to build operational inventory while implementing the new regulations and maintaining social licenses to operate. Occidental additionally continues to have development optionality by flexing resources between the DJ Basin and another emerging high rate-of-return program in the Powder River Basin.As discussed above, in January 2021, the COGCC adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements or “setbacks” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures. While Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these regulations on its business; at this time, Occidental does not anticipate significant near-term changes to our development program in the DJ Basin based on these regulations. However, if Occidental is unable to obtain new drilling permits to develop a significant portion of the company’s undeveloped acreage in the DJ Basin, the company’s DJ Basin assets may be subject to testing for impairment, and if deemed to be impaired, such impairment could be material to our financial statements.Other DomesticOccidental holds approximately 5.0 million net acres in other domestic locations, which is primarily comprised of the Powder River Basin, North DJ Basin and Wyoming. Occidental's share of production in other domestic locations was approximately 39 Mboe/d in 2020.OFFSHORE DOMESTIC ASSETSGulf of MexicoOccidental owns a working interest in 182 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, operates 10 active floating platforms and holds interests in 17 active fields. The Gulf of Mexico produced approximately 130 Mboe/d during 2020. In 2021, Occidental will continue to take advantage of its extensive infrastructure across the Gulf of Mexico to execute its long-term plan for development and exploration. Occidental will operate one floating drillship and one platform rig together with two multi-service vessels to cost effectively develop known resources. Occidental continues to work with the BSEE and the BOEM to address the additional regulatory requirements to ensure a minimal disruption of activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The following table shows areas of continuing development in the Gulf of Mexico along with the corresponding working interest in those areas.Working InterestHorn Mountain100 %Holstein100 %Marlin100 %Lucius64 %K2 Complex42 %Caesar Tonga34 %Constellation33 %INTERNATIONAL INTERESTSBUSINESS REVIEWOccidental conducts its ongoing international operations in two sub-regions: the Middle East and Africa. Its activities include oil, NGL and natural gas production through direct working-interests and production sharing contracts (PSC).Production Sharing ContractsOccidental’s interest in Oman and Qatar are subject to PSCs. Under such contracts, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on 26OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOccidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Overall, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher.The following chart shows Occidental’s international production volumes for the previous three years:Note: Operations sold, exited or held for sale include the Ghana assets (held for sale at December 31, 2020 and 2019), the Colombia onshore assets (sold in December 2020) and the Qatar Idd El Shargi Fields (exited in 2019).MIDDLE EAST / NORTH AFRICA ASSETS1.Algeria2.Oman3.Qatar4.United Arab EmiratesAlgeriaIn April 2020, subsequent to communications with Algerian government officials, Occidental determined that the sale of the Algeria operations to Total would not be consummated and the decision was made to continue to operate within Algeria. As a result, Occidental reclassified 2019 results to reflect the Algeria operations as continuing operations. Operations in Algeria involve production and development activities in 18 fields within Blocks 404A and 208, which are located in the Berkine Basin in Algeria’s Sahara Desert and are governed by a Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) between Occidental, Sonatrach and other partners. Under this PSA, Occidental is responsible for 24.5% of the development and production costs. The El Merk Central Processing Facility (CPF) in Block 208 processed produced oil and NGL, while the Hassi Berkine OXY 2020 FORM 10-K27MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSouth and Ourhoud CPFs in Block 404A processed produced oil. In 2020, Occidental drilled two development wells and plans to continue drilling operations throughout 2021. Net production in Algeria was 44 Mboe/d in 2020.OmanIn Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 with a 50% working interest, Block 27 with a 65% working interest, Block 53 with a 47% working interest and Block 62 with a 100% working interest. Occidental additionally has exploration and production sharing agreements for Blocks 30, 51, 65 and 72. Occidental holds 6.0 million gross acres and has 10,000 potential well inventory locations. In 2020, Occidental’s share of production was 85 Mboe/d.The Block 9 contract expires in 2030 and the Block 27 contract expires in 2035. Occidental’s share of production for Blocks 9 and 27 was 30 Mboe/d and six Mboe/d in 2020, respectively. The Block 53 (Mukhaizna Field) contract expires in 2035 and is a major world-class pattern steam flood project for EOR that utilizes some of the largest mechanical vapor compressors ever built. Since assuming operations in Mukhaizna in 2005, Occidental has drilled over 3,550 new wells and has increased gross production by over 15 fold. Occidental’s share of production for Block 53 was 30 Mboe/d in 2020. Subject to a declaration of commerciality, Occidental’s permit for Block 62 will expire in 2028. Occidental’s share of production for Block 62 was 19 Mboe/d in 2020.QatarIn Qatar, Occidental partners in the Dolphin Energy Project, an investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests. Occidental has a 24.5% interest in the upstream operations (Dolphin) to develop and produce NGL, natural gas and condensate from Qatar’s North Field through mid-2032. Occidental also has a 24.5% interest in Dolphin Energy Limited, which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in the Midstream and Marketing Segment section in this Form 10-K under Pipeline. Occidental’s net share of production from the Dolphin upstream operations was 44 Mboe/d in 2020.United Arab EmiratesIn 2011, Occidental acquired a 40% participating interest in the Shah gas field (Al Hosn Gas), joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in a 30-year joint venture agreement. In 2020, Occidental’s share of production from Al Hosn Gas was 238 MMcf/d of natural gas and 38 Mboe/d of NGL and condensate. Al Hosn Gas includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in the Midstream and Marketing Segment section in this Form 10-K under Gas Processing, Gathering and CO2.In 2019 and 2020, Occidental acquired 9-year exploration concessions and, subject to a declaration of commerciality, 35-year production concessions adjacent to Al Hosn Gas for onshore Block 3 and Block 5, which cover an area of approximately 1.5 million acres and 1.0 million acres, respectively. Occidental conducts a majority of its Middle East business development activities through its office in Abu Dhabi, which also provides various support functions for Occidental’s Middle East oil and gas operations.Ghana - Discontinued OperationsIn May 2020, Occidental and Total mutually agreed to execute a waiver of the obligation to purchase and sell the Ghana assets, so that Occidental could begin marketing the sale of the Ghana assets to other third parties. Occidental is currently marketing the Ghana assets. The assets and liabilities for Ghana remain presented as held for sale in discontinued operations at December 31, 2020. Ghana operations include production and development activities located offshore in the West Cape Three Point Block and the Deepwater Tano Block. Occidental’s share of production in 2020 was 30 Mboe/d.LATIN AMERICA ASSETSColombiaIn December 2020, Occidental completed the sale of its Colombia onshore assets, specifically the operations and working interests in the Llanos Norte, Middle Magdalena and Putumayo Basins. Occidental has retained a presence with exploration blocks offshore Colombia. PROVED RESERVESProved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. Oil, NGL and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs. 28OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe following table shows the 2020, 2019 and 2018 calculated first-day-of-the-month average prices for both WTI and Brent oil prices, as well as the Henry Hub gas prices measured in million British thermal units (MMbtu):202020192018WTI Oil ($/Bbl)$39.57 $55.69 $65.56 Brent Oil ($/Bbl)$43.41 $63.03 $72.20 Henry Hub Natural Gas ($/MMbtu)$1.98 $2.58 $3.10 Mt. Belvieu NGL ($/Bbl) (a)$18.74 N/AN/A(a)Mt. Belvieu pricing was added as an NGL benchmark beginning in 2020. Prior to 2020, WTI oil was used as a benchmark for NGL.Occidental had proved reserves from continuing operations at year-end 2020 of 2,911 MMboe, compared to the year-end 2019 amount of 3,904 MMboe. Proved developed (PD) reserves represented approximately 78% and 77% of Occidental’s total proved reserves at year-end 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table shows the breakout of Occidental’s proved reserves from continuing operations by commodity as a percentage of total proved reserves:20202019Oil51 %52 %Natural gas29 %29 %NGL20 %19 %Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources. For further information regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, see the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information section in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.CHANGES IN PROVED RESERVESOccidental’s total proved reserves from continuing operations decreased 993 MMboe in 2020, which was primarily driven by price and other revisions of 484 MMboe and asset divestitures of 241 MMboe. These decreases were partially offset by increases from Occidental’s development program of 212 MMboe. Changes in reserves were as follows:MMboe2020Revisions of previous estimates(484)Improved recovery190 Extensions and discoveries22 Purchases4 Sales(241)Production(484)Total (993)Occidental’s ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect Occidental’s reserves.Revisions of Previous EstimatesRevisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data. In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental. For example, lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations. Offsetting this effect, lower prices increase Occidental’s share of proved reserves under PSCs because more oil is required to recover costs. Conversely, when prices rise, Occidental’s share of proved reserves decreases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations. Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease, as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.In 2020, Occidental’s revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves were negative 484 MMboe, of which approximately 342 MMboe were negative price revisions. The negative price revisions were primarily associated with the OXY 2020 FORM 10-K29MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISPermian Basin (283 MMboe) and the DJ Basin (74 MMboe), which were partially offset by positive price revisions of 36 MMboe on international production sharing contracts.An additional 197 MMboe of negative revisions were related to management changes in development plans due to lower average commodity prices compared to the prior year and the reallocation of capital to higher return projects. These changes were primarily associated with the Permian Basin (143 MMboe).Further positive revisions of 57 MMboe, net, were associated with updates based on reservoir performance. The remaining revisions were associated with various other cost related revisions.Improved RecoveryIn 2020, Occidental added proved reserves of 190 MMboe related to improved recovery primarily due to additional development drilling, mainly in the Permian Basin which accounted for approximately two-thirds of the reserve additions. These properties comprise both unconventional projects and conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO2 flood, waterflood or steam flood and unconventional projects. These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration. Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells. The use of either CO2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either CO2 or steam and other economic factors. Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells. Many of Occidental’s projects, including unconventional projects, rely on improving permeability to increase flow in the wells. In addition, some improved recovery comes from drilling infill wells that allow recovery of reserves that would not be recoverable from existing wells. Further positive additions of 32 MMboe in the UAE, 13 MMboe in Oman, 9 MMboe in the DJ Basin and 9 MMboe in the Gulf of Mexico were similarly the result of development drilling.Extensions and DiscoveriesOccidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs. In 2020, extensions and discoveries added 22 MMboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the DJ Basin, Wyoming and Oman.Purchases of Proved ReservesIn 2020, Occidental purchased proved reserves of 4 MMboe primarily consisting of proved reserves in the Permian Basin.Sales of Proved ReservesIn 2020, Occidental sold 241 MMboe in proved reserves, primarily related to the divestitures of the Colombia onshore assets, the mineral acres and fee surface acres located in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah and the non-core, largely non-operated acreage in the Permian Basin. Proved Undeveloped ReservesOccidental had proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2020 of 645 MMboe, compared to the year-end 2019 amount of 905 MMboe.Changes in proved undeveloped reserves were as follows:MMboe2020Revisions of previous estimates(253)Improved recovery132 Extensions and discoveries6 Purchases3 Sales(44)Transfer to proved developed reserves(104)Total(260)Total improved recovery additions of 132 MMboe were primarily the result of additional development drilling in the Permian Basin (80 MMboe), international assets (41 MMboe) and the DJ Basin (7 MMboe). The 2020 additions to proved undeveloped reserves were offset by transfers to proved developed reserves and negative revisions of previous estimates. Transfers to proved developed reserves were a total of 104 MMboe. The transfers were primarily associated with the DJ Basin (53 MMboe) and the Permian Basin (48 MMboe). Revisions of previous estimates were a negative 253 MMboe. Approximately 123 MMboe of the negative revisions were related to management changes in development plans, primarily associated with the Permian Basin (111 MMboe). Additionally, the revisions include preliminary impacts related to the 30OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISJanuary 2021 COGCC regulation in the DJ Basin. Further, 77 MMboe of negative revisions were associated with updates based on reservoir performance and 55 MMboe of negative revisions were associated with price revisions.Proved undeveloped reserves are supported by a five-year detailed field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled. Only proved undeveloped reserves which are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan. A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development projects.In 2020, Occidental incurred approximately $0.5 billion to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand and cash flows, Occidental reduced its 2020 capital expenditures from $5.2 billion to $2.6 billion and; accordingly, converted a lower than expected amount of reserves from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. In 2020 Occidental converted approximately 17% of its PUDs to proved developed, when adjusted for revisions and sales. As of December 31, 2020, Occidental had 645 MMboe of PUDs of which 49% were associated with domestic onshore, 8% with Gulf of Mexico and 43% with international assets.Occidental’s most active development areas are located in the Permian Basin, which represented 36% of the proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2020. Approximately 40% of Occidental’s 2021 capital program of $2.9 billion is allocated to the development program in the Permian Basin. Overall, Occidental plans to spend approximately $1.5 billion over the next five years to develop its proved undeveloped reserves in the Permian Basin.At December 31, 2020, Occidental had 207 MMboe of pre-2016 proved undeveloped reserves that remained undeveloped. These proved undeveloped reserves relate to approved long-term development plans, 187 MMboe of which are associated with international development projects with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity and 20 MMboe associated with certain Permian EOR projects. Occidental remains committed to these projects and continues to actively progress the development of these volumes. In addition to the above, Occidental has 89 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves that are scheduled to be developed more than five years from their initial date of booking. These proved undeveloped reserves are primarily related to approved long-term development plans with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity, 51 MMboe of which are associated with other Permian EOR projects and 31 MMboe associated with international development projects. RESERVES EVALUATION AND REVIEW PROCESSOccidental’s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2020, were made by Occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management. The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves. This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts. As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves. Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance. These reliable field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Proved undeveloped reserves are supported by a five-year, detailed, field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled. The development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel. Annually, a detailed review is performed by Occidental’s Worldwide Reserves Group and its technical personnel on a lease-by-lease basis to assess whether proved undeveloped reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date. Any leases not showing timely transfers from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and have sufficient capital committed in the development plan. Only proved undeveloped reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan. A portion of the proved undeveloped reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development plans.The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with U.S. SEC rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental’s oil and gas reserves data. He has over 40 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe. He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. He is an American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Certified Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation. He is a member of the OXY 2020 FORM 10-K31MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSociety of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Expert Group on Resource Management. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental’s oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental’s Board of Directors during the year. Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes. For additional reserves information, see Supplemental Oil and Gas Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In 2020, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2020, in accordance with SEC regulatory standards. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental’s 2020 year-end total proved reserves portfolio. In 2020, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 30% of Occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 87% of Occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves.Management retained Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental. Occidental has filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, documenting the changes in reserves from prior estimates, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.CHEMICAL SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYOxyChem seeks to be a low-cost producer in order to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain, beginning with the co-production of caustic soda and chlorine. Caustic soda and chlorine are marketed to external customers. In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC. OxyChem’s focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale. Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets. Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities. In 2020, capital expenditures for OxyChem totaled $255 million.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTIn 2020, the United States economic contraction, estimated to be 3.5%, was significantly lower than the 2.2% growth experienced in 2019, which resulted in lower demand for caustic soda and PVC. Pricing for PVC rebounded in the second half of 2020 and finished higher than the 2019 average due to increased domestic demand and lower supply. Caustic soda prices were lower in 2020, partially offset by lower ethylene and energy costs.BUSINESS REVIEWBASIC CHEMICALS The U.S. economic contraction due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower domestic demand as the industry chlor-alkali operating rates decreased by 8% compared to 2019. Liquid caustic soda prices were lower both domestically and globally in 2020 due to weaker demand in the pulp and paper and industrial market segments, which was partially offset by lower energy prices than in 2019. Stronger chlorine derivative demand in relation to caustic soda resulted in persistent downward pressure on caustic soda pricing.VINYLSDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply interruptions during a very active hurricane season, industry demand for PVC in 2020 decreased year-over-year by 4%, resulting in 6% lower operating rates. Domestic demand was up 5.4% while export demand was down 22% from 2019. Second half 2020 housing starts, construction and home improvement markets were the main contributors for the strong rebound in domestic demand. US domestic producers grappled with extended production outages resulting in lower PVC availability for export markets. Export volume 32OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISrepresented 28% of total North American production. Industry PVC margins increased in 2020 due to a strong price environment driven by higher than expected demand and limited supply.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKIndustry performance will depend on the health of the global economy and the effectiveness of the vaccine rollouts. Continued recovery from 2020 should result in improvement in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets. The housing and construction as well as automotive markets are expected to strengthen over the next year. Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices. Recovery in the petroleum industry should strengthen the demand and pricing of a number of Occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants. U.S. commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar.BASIC CHEMICALSDemand for basic chemicals is expected to improve in 2021 over 2020 levels. Improvement in most market segments is expected with improvement in the overall economy. Demand for chlorine and derivatives will improve with continued growth in the housing, general construction and automotive markets. Demand for alkali products, particularly caustic soda, will improve with growth in the pulp and paper, industrial and alumina markets. Chlor-alkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs.VINYLSDomestic PVC demand is expected to improve in 2021 over 2020 levels. Growth in residential construction spending and expected new infrastructure projects is forecast to drive domestic growth in 2021. Although overall PVC demand is expected to remain strong in North America, operating rates are anticipated to remain relatively flat in 2021 as new PVC capacity is expected to enter the market in the second half of the year.MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYThe midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize realized value by optimizing the use of its gathering, processing, transportation, storage and terminal commitments and by providing access to domestic and international markets. To generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to Occidental’s subsidiaries, as well as third parties. The midstream and marketing segment operates or contracts for services on gathering systems, gas plants, co-generation facilities and storage facilities and invests in entities that conduct similar activities. As of December 31, 2019, Occidental began accounting for its ownership investment in WES under the equity method of accounting. See Note 16 - Investments and Related-Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.The midstream and marketing segment has equity investments in WES and Dolphin Energy Limited. WES owns gathering systems, plants and pipelines and earns revenue from fee-based and service-based contracts with Occidental and third parties. Dolphin Energy Limited owns and operates a pipeline which connects its gas processing and compression plant in Qatar and its receiving facilities in UAE, and uses its network of Dolphin Energy Limited-owned and other existing leased pipelines to supply natural gas across the UAE and to Oman. Also included in the midstream and marketing segment is OLCV. OLCV seeks to leverage Occidental’s carbon management expertise that is derived from its EOR operations to develop carbon capture, utilization and storage facilities that are expected to source anthropogenic CO2 and promote innovative technologies that drive cost efficiencies and economically grow Occidental’s business while reducing emissions.This segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas and power used in Occidental’s various businesses. Capital is employed to sustain or expand assets to improve the competitiveness of Occidental’s businesses. In 2020, capital expenditures related to the midstream and marketing segment totaled $50 million.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTMidstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses, including its marketing, gathering and transportation, gas processing and power-generation assets. The marketing business aggregates, markets and stores Occidental and third-party volumes. Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. The marketing business results can experience significant volatility depending on commodity price changes and the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. The Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads have decreased from an average of $6.58 per barrel in 2019 to $1.43 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020 and averaging $0.59 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2020. A $0.25 change in the Midland-to-Gulf- Coast oil spreads impacts total year operating cash flows by $65 million. In 2020, Permian to Gulf Coast transportation capacity increased as new third-party pipelines were completed. This along with reduction in Permian Basin production, reduced the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. Gas gathering, processing and transportation results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment’s plants, as well OXY 2020 FORM 10-K33MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISas the margins obtained on related services from investments in which Occidental has an equity interest. The 2020 declines in NGL prices and sulfur prices negatively impacted the gas processing business.BUSINESS REVIEWMARKETINGThe marketing group markets substantially all of Occidental’s oil, NGL and natural gas production, as well as trades around its assets, including contracted transportation and storage capacity. Occidental’s third-party marketing activities focus on purchasing oil, NGL and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets. These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets. In 2020, compared to the prior year, marketing results were negatively impacted by the decline in the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. PIPELINEOccidental’s pipeline business mainly consists of its 24.5% ownership interest in Dolphin Energy Limited. Dolphin Energy Limited owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman. The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf/d and currently transports approximately 2.2 Bcf/d and up to 2.5 Bcf/d in the summer months.GAS PROCESSING, GATHERING AND CO2Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGL and other gas byproducts, including CO2 and delivers dry gas to pipelines. Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGL.As of December 31, 2020, Occidental has a 2% non-voting general partner interest and a 51.8% limited partner interest in WES and a 2% non-voting limited partner interest in WES Operating, a subsidiary of WES. As of December 31, 2020, on a combined basis, Occidental's total effective economic interest in WES and its subsidiaries is 53.5%. Occidental intends to reduce its limited partner ownership interest in WES to below 50%. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information regarding Occidental’s equity method investment in WES. WES owns gathering systems, plants and pipelines and earns revenue from fee-based and service-based contracts with Occidental and third parties.Occidental’s 40% participating interest in Al Hosn Gas also includes sour gas processing facilities that are designed to process 1.3 Bcf/d of natural gas and separate it into salable gas, condensate, NGL and sulfur. In 2020, the facilities produced 11,300 tons per day of sulfur, of which approximately 4,500 tons per day was Occidental’s net share. In 2020, compared to the prior year, gas processing, gathering and CO2 results decreased primarily due to lower NGL prices and sulfur prices, which negatively impacted the gas processing business.POWER GENERATION FACILITIESEarnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties.LOW CARBON VENTURESOLCV was formed to execute on Occidental’s vision to reduce global emissions and provide a more sustainable future through low carbon energy and products. OLCV capitalizes on Occidental’s extensive experience in utilizing CO2 for EOR by investing in technologies, developing projects and providing services to facilitate and accelerate the implementation of carbon capture, utilization and storage projects and opportunities for zero-carbon power. Moreover, OLCV is fostering new technologies and business models with the potential to position Occidental as a leader in the production of low-carbon oil and products.Occidental has developed standards and protocols recognized by the EPA for monitoring, reporting and verifying the amount, safety and permanence of CO2 stored through secure geologic sequestration. The company holds the nation’s first two EPA-approved monitoring, reporting and verification plans for geologic sequestration through EOR production.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKMidstream and marketing segment results can experience volatility depending on the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads and commodity price changes. To a lesser extent, declines in commodity prices, including NGL and sulfur prices, reduce the results for the gas processing business.34OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITYSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSegment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from divestitures of segment assets and income from the segments’ equity investments.

The 2019 amount represented a $114 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Plains GP Holdings, L.P. (together, Plains). The 2018 amount represented a gain on sale of non-core domestic midstream assets.(c)The 2020 amount included a $2.7 billion other-than-temporary impairment of the equity investment in WES and $1.4 billion of impairments related to the write-off of goodwill and a loss from an equity investment related to WES’ write-off of its goodwill. The 2019 amount included a $1 billion charge as a result of recording Occidental’s investment in WES at fair value as of December 31, 2019 upon the loss of control.(d)The 2019 amount represented a $30 million mark-to-market gain on an interest rate swap for WES.Midstream and marketing segment results, excluding items affecting comparability, decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower marketing margins from the tightening of the average Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads by $5.15 per barrel, and to a lesser extent lower pipeline income following the sale of the Plains equity investment in the third quarter of 2019 and lower sulfur prices impacting Al Hosn Gas.CORPORATESignificant corporate items include the following:millions202020192018Items Affecting ComparabilityAnadarko Acquisition-related costs$(339)$(1,647)$— Bridge loan financing fees$— $(122)$— Acquisition-related pension and termination benefits$114 $37 $— Interest rate swaps mark-to-market, net$(428)$122 $— Other charges and asset impairments$— $(22)$— Warrant gains mark-to-market$5 $81 $— INCOME TAXES Total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance, were $4.3 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences. The total deferred tax liabilities were $11.4 billion and $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The decrease in net deferred tax liability in 2020 over 2019 is primarily driven by domestic asset impairments for which Occidental does not receive an immediate tax benefit as well as an increase in net operating loss carryforwards.38OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISWORLDWIDE EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:millions202020192018SEGMENT RESULTS Oil and gas$(9,632)$2,520 $2,442 Chemical664 799 1,159 Midstream and marketing(4,175)241 2,802 Unallocated corporate items(2,562)(3,206)(795)Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes(15,705)354 5,608 Income tax benefit (expense) Federal and state2,607 34 (463)Foreign(435)(895)(1,014)Total income tax benefit (expense)2,172 (861)(1,477)Income (loss) from continuing operations(13,533)(507)4,131 Worldwide effective tax rate14%243%26%In 2020, Occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 14%, which was largely a result of the impairment of the WES goodwill and certain international assets, for which Occidental receives no tax benefit and higher-taxed foreign operations which generally caused Occidental’s tax rate to vary significantly from the U.S. corporate tax rate. Occidental’s effective tax rate is impacted each year by the relative pre-tax income (loss) earned by its domestic and international operations.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSREVENUE AND OTHER INCOME ITEMSmillions202020192018Net sales$17,809 $20,911 $17,824 Interest, dividends and other income$118 $217 $136 Gains (losses) on sale of assets, net$(1,666)$622 $974 Price and volume changes generally represent the majority of the change in the oil and gas and chemical segments sales. Midstream and marketing sales are mainly impacted by the lower marketing margins from the decrease in the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads and, to a lesser extent, the change in NGL and sulfur prices for the gas processing business.The decrease in net sales in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower realized oil prices in the oil and gas segment despite higher volumes as a result of a full year of production from properties added in the Acquisition and net gains on the three-way oil collars. Midstream and marketing sales declined due to tightening of the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. Chemical sales declined primarily due to lower sales volumes across all products and lower realized caustic soda prices.The 2020 losses on sales of assets, net, is primarily comprised of $820 million related to the sale of certain non-core, largely non-operated acreage in the Permian Basin, $440 million related to the sale of 4.5 million mineral acres and 1 million fee surface acres located in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, $353 million related to the sale of the Colombia onshore assets and a loss of $46 million related to the WES note exchange.OXY 2020 FORM 10-K39MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISEXPENSE ITEMSmillions202020192018Oil and gas operating expense$3,065 $3,282 $2,761 Transportation and gathering expense$1,600 $635 $152 Chemical and midstream cost of sales$2,408 $2,791 $2,833 Purchased commodities$1,395 $1,679 $822 Selling, general and administrative$864 $893 $585 Other operating and non-operating expense$884 $1,421 $1,028 Depreciation, depletion and amortization$8,097 $6,140 $3,977 Asset impairments and other charges$11,083 $1,361 $561 Taxes other than on income$622 $840 $439 Anadarko Acquisition-related costs$339 $1,647 $— Exploration expense$132 $247 $110 Interest and debt expense, net$1,424 $1,066 $389 OIL AND GAS OPERATING EXPENSEOil and gas operating expense decreased in 2020 from the prior year, primarily due to operational efficiencies that decreased downhole maintenance and workover and support costs and lower energy and purchased injectant costs. TRANSPORTATION AND GATHERING EXPENSETransportation and gathering expense increased in 2020 from the prior year, primarily due to a full year of increased sales volumes related to the Acquisition as well as transportation costs to WES which was previously a consolidated entity in 2019. CHEMICAL AND MIDSTREAM COST OF SALESChemical and midstream cost of sales decreased in 2020 from the prior year, primarily due to favorable raw material costs in the chemical segment and lower midstream operation costs due to the loss of control of WES in 2019. PURCHASED COMMODITIESPurchased commodities decreased in 2020 largely as a result of lower crude oil prices on third-party crude purchases related to the midstream and marketing segment. OTHER OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING EXPENSEOther operating and non-operating expense decreased in 2020 from the prior year, primarily due to the realization of overhead savings and a net gain related to the settlement, curtailment and special termination benefits on pension plans acquired in the Acquisition. DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION (DD&A)DD&A expense increased in 2020 from the prior year, primarily due to having a full year of production in 2020 associated with assets acquired through the Acquisition. ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER CHARGESIn 2020, asset impairments and other charges included pre-tax impairments of $4.5 billion primarily related to domestic onshore unproved acreage as well as $1.3 billion primarily related to other domestic onshore assets and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition there were $931 million of impairment and related charges associated with Occidental’s proved properties in Algeria to remeasure the Algeria oil and gas properties to their fair value. In addition, for the midstream and marketing segment, there were pre-tax impairment charges of $2.7 billion other-than-temporary impairment of the equity investment in WES and $1.2 billion of impairments related to the write-off of goodwill.TAXES OTHER THAN ON INCOMETaxes other than on income in 2020 decreased from the prior year, due to lower production taxes which are directly tied to prices on oil, NGL and natural gas volumes.40OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISACQUISITION RELATED EXPENSESAcquisition related expenses in 2020 are associated with employee severance and related employee costs primarily related to one-time severance costs and the accelerated vesting of certain Anadarko share-based awards for former Anadarko employees based on the terms of the Acquisition and existing change of control provisions within the former Anadarko employment agreements. INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE, NETInterest and debt expense, net, increased in 2020 from the prior year due to an increase in debt issued to partially fund the Acquisition, as well as the debt assumed through the Acquisition. OTHER ITEMSIncome/(expense) millions202020192018Gains (losses) on interest rate swaps and warrants$(423)$233 $— Income from equity investments$370 $373 $331 Income tax benefit (expense)$2,172 $(861)$(1,477)GAINS (LOSSES) ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND WARRANTS Gains (losses) on interest rate swaps and warrants are primarily due to a decline in the reference rate on the interest rate swaps throughout 2020, as fixed interest rates exceed the floating interest rates during the reference period. INCOME TAX BENEFIT (EXPENSE)Occidental realized an income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to an income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower pre-tax income, partially offset by the impairment of certain international assets as well as the equity method goodwill associated with the WES investment, for which Occidental received no tax benefit.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NETDiscontinued operations, net in 2020 is associated with the operations of Ghana for which Occidental continues to present as held for sale. The decrease in income in 2020 is primarily associated with an after-tax impairment of $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2020 to reflect the held for sale assets at their fair value less costs to sell based on the income approach.OXY 2020 FORM 10-K41MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH ON HANDAt December 31, 2020, Occidental had approximately $2.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents. A substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the United States.Occidental’s $5 billion RCF, available cash, continued access to capital markets and positive operating cash flows will allow Occidental to meet its short- and long-term purchase obligations, near-term debt maturities and other liabilities.At December 31, 2020, Occidental had $0.4 billion in current maturities of long-term debt through December 31, 2021 and an additional $2.1 billion in long-term obligations due in 2022. Other near-term obligations include interest rate swaps with mandatory termination dates in September 2021 with a notional value of $750 million and accounts payable incurred in the course of Occidental’s business activities. Occidental continues to pursue divestitures of certain assets and intends to use the net proceeds from asset sales and free cash flow to repay its nearer-term debt maturities, but the expected timing and final proceeds from such asset sales are uncertain. Occidental currently expects its cash on hand to be sufficient to meet its debt maturities, operating expenditures and other obligations for the next 12 months from the date of this filing. However, given the inherent uncertainty associated with the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting impact on oil demand, Occidental may need to raise capital to fund its operations and refinance debt maturities.At December 31, 2020, Occidental had $170 million in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, which was primarily associated with an international joint venture, a benefits trust for former Anadarko employees that was funded as part of the Acquisition and a judicially controlled account related to a Brazilian tax dispute. Restricted cash within the benefits trust will be made available to Occidental as benefits are paid to former Anadarko employees.DEBT ACTIVITYOn March 23, 2020, Occidental amended the sole financial covenant in its RCF by revising the definition of ""Total Capitalization"" to exclude any non-cash write-downs, impairments and related charges occurring after September 30, 2019. The amendments provide Occidental with additional flexibility in the event of any such write-downs, impairments or other changes under the ratio of Total Debt to Total Capitalization covenant.In July, August, and December, 2020, Occidental issued several series of notes with maturities from five to ten years. The proceeds from these issuances were used to tender and repay nearer-term notes and the Term Loan. Occidental used proceeds from the sale of mineral and surface acres located in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, the Colombian asset sale and proceeds from other divestitures to repay debt. Occidental used the net proceeds from asset sales, cash on hand and Senior Notes Offerings to retire or tender $6.0 billion of 2021, $2.7 billion of 2022 and $264 million of 2023 maturities. In August 2020, Occidental exchanged approximately 27.9 million WES common units to retire a $260 million note payable to WES.See Note 7 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information related to Occidental’s debt issuance and repayments.As of December 31, 2020, under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.CASH FLOW ANALYSISCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIESmillions202020192018Operating cash flow from continuing operations$3,842 $7,336 $7,669 Operating cash flow from discontinued operations, net of taxes113 39 — Net cash provided by operating activities$3,955 $7,375 $7,669 Cash provided by operating activities decreased $3.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower oil prices as average WTI and Brent prices decreased by 31% and 33%, respectively. Operating cash flows also decreased due to the decrease in the average Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads, which decreased by $5.15 per barrel in 2020 compared to 2019. To a lesser extent, the reduction in realized NGL and natural gas prices also impacted the lower operating cash flows in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by higher oil and gas sale volumes as 2020 had a full year of production from assets associated with the Acquisition along with settlement of the three-way oil collars of $0.9 billion. 42OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIESmillions202020192018Capital expenditures Oil and gas$(2,208)$(5,512)$(4,413)Chemical(255)(267)(271)Midstream and marketing(50)(461)(216)Corporate(22)(127)(75)Total$(2,535)$(6,367)$(4,975)Changes in capital accrual(519)(249)55 Purchase of businesses and assets, net(114)(28,088)(928)Proceeds from sale of assets and equity investments, net2,281 6,143 2,824 Other investing activities, net109 (291)(182)Investing cash flows from continuing operations$(778)$(28,852)$(3,206)Investing cash flows from discontinued operations(41)(175)— Net cash used by investing activities$(819)$(29,027)$(3,206)Cash flows used by investing activities decreased by $28.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the 2019 Acquisition.

Additionally, common dividends paid in 2020 were lower than 2019 due to the Board of Directors’ decision to reduce the quarterly dividend rate effective as of July 2020 from $0.79 to $0.01 per share. See Note 7 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information related to Occidental’s debt issuance and repayments. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSGUARANTEESOccidental has guaranteed its portion of the debt of Dolphin Energy Limited, an equity method investment, and has entered into various other guarantees, including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that Occidental or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations. See “Midstream and Marketing Segment — Business Review — Pipeline” and “Segment Results of Operations” for further information regarding the Dolphin Energy Project. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, Occidental had provided limited recourse guarantees of approximately $242 million, primarily related to Dolphin Energy Limited’s debt, which are limited to certain political and other events.COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONSDELIVERY COMMITMENTSOccidental has made long-term commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, NGL and natural gas. The total amount contracted to be delivered is approximately 111 MMbbl of oil through 2025, 862 MMbbl of NGL through 2029 and 1,025 Bcf of gas through 2029. The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product. Occidental has significantly more production capacity than the amounts committed and has the ability to secure additional volumes in case of a shortfall.OXY 2020 FORM 10-K43MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSThe following table summarizes and cross-references Occidental’s contractual obligations and indicates on- and off-balance sheet obligations as of December 31, 2020.

See Note 2 - Accounting and Disclosure Changes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K regarding the impact of rules effective January 1, 2019 which required Occidental to recognize most leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet.(c)Includes long term obligations and current portions of long term obligations under postretirement benefit, accrued transportation commitments, ad valorem taxes and other accrued liabilities.(d)Amounts include payments which will become due under long-term agreements to purchase goods and services used in the normal course of business to secure terminal, pipeline and processing capacity, CO2, electrical power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. Amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable. Long-term purchase contracts are discounted at a 4.41% discount rate. LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLEGAL MATTERSOccidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief. Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief. Usually Occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for matters, other than for environmental remediation, that satisfy this criteria as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, were not material to Occidental’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.In 2016, Occidental received payments from the Republic of Ecuador of approximately $1.0 billion pursuant to a November 2015 arbitration award for Ecuador’s 2006 expropriation of Occidental's Participation Contract for Block 15. The awarded amount represented a recovery of 60% of the value of Block 15. In 2017, Andes Petroleum Ecuador Ltd. (Andes) filed a demand for arbitration, claiming it is entitled to a 40% share of the judgment amount obtained by Occidental. Occidental contends that Andes is not entitled to any of the amounts paid under the 2015 arbitration award because Occidental’s recovery was limited to Occidental’s own 60% economic interest in the block. The merits hearing occurred in September 2020 and an arbitration decision is expected within the next six months.In August 2019, Sanchez Energy Corporation and certain of its affiliates (Sanchez) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Sanchez is a party to agreements with Anadarko as 44OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISa result of its 2017 purchase of Anadarko's Eagle Ford Shale assets. Sanchez is attempting to reject some of the agreements related to the purchase of Anadarko’s Eagle Ford Shale assets. If Sanchez is permitted to reject certain of those agreements, then Anadarko may owe deficiency payments to various third parties. Occidental intends to defend vigorously any attempt by Sanchez to reject the agreements. Occidental expects a ruling on Sanchez's purported contract rejection in the first half of 2021.On May 26, 2020, a putative securities class action captioned City of Sterling Heights General Employees’ Retirement System, et al. v. Occidental Petroleum Corporation, et al., No. 651994/2020 (City of Sterling), was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 11, 12 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), based on alleged misstatements in the Securities Act filings, including the registration statement filed in connection with the Anadarko Acquisition and Occidental’s related issuance of common stock and debt securities offerings that took place in August 2019. The lawsuit was filed against Occidental, certain current and former officers and directors and certain underwriters of the debt securities offerings, and seeks damages in an unspecified amount, plus attorneys’ fees and expenses. Two additional putative class actions were filed in the same court (together with City of Sterling, the State Cases) and the State Cases were consolidated into In re Occidental Petroleum Corporation Securities Litigation, No. 651830/2020. Occidental intends to vigorously defend itself in all respects in regard to the State Cases.The ultimate outcome and impact of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings on Occidental cannot be predicted. Management believes that the resolution of these matters will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Occidental's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur, future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected. Occidental’s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.TAX MATTERSDuring the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Taxable years through 2017 for U.S. federal income tax purposes have been audited by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program and subsequent taxable years are currently under review. Taxable years through 2009 have been audited for state income tax purposes. All other significant audit matters in foreign jurisdictions have been resolved through 2010. During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.For Anadarko, its taxable years through 2014 and tax year 2016 for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes have been audited by the IRS and respective state taxing authorities. There are outstanding significant audit matters in one foreign jurisdiction. As stated above, during the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. Other than the matter discussed below, Occidental believes that the resolution of these outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Anadarko received an $881 million tentative refund in 2016 related to its $5.2 billion Tronox Adversary Proceeding settlement payment in 2015. In September 2018, Anadarko received a statutory notice of deficiency from the IRS disallowing the net operating loss carryback and rejecting Anadarko’s refund claim. As a result, Anadarko filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court to dispute the disallowances in November 2018. The case was in the IRS appeals process until the second quarter of 2020, however it has since been returned to the U.S. Tax Court where Occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution.In accordance with ASC 740’s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions, Occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund of $881 million. As a result, should Occidental not ultimately prevail on the issue, there would be no additional tax expense recorded relative to this position for financial statement purposes other than future interest. However, in that event Occidental would be required to repay approximately $925 million ($898 million federal and $27 million in state taxes) plus accrued interest of approximately $255 million. A liability for this amount plus interest is included in deferred credits and other liabilities-other.INDEMNITIES TO THIRD PARTIESOccidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2020, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.OXY 2020 FORM 10-K45MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURESOccidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality. The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and international laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites. Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems. The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATIONAs of December 31, 2020, Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 170 sites. The following table presents Occidental’s current and non-current environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($123 million in 2020 and $162 million in 2019) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities - environmental remediation liabilities ($1.03 billion in 2020 and $1.04 billion in 2019).Occidental’s environmental remediation sites are grouped into four categories: National Priorities List (NPL) sites listed or proposed for listing by the EPA on the CERCLA NPL and three categories of non-NPL sites — third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.20202019millions, except number of sitesNumber of SitesRemediation BalanceNumber of SitesRemediation BalanceNPL sites35 $447 36 $463 Third-party sites69 293 74 311 Occidental-operated sites17 144 17 154 Closed or non-operated Occidental sites49 267 50 269 Total170 $1,151 177 $1,197 As of December 31, 2020, Occidental’s environmental liabilities exceeded $10 million each at 19 of the 170 sites described above, and 96 of the sites had liabilities from $0 to $1 million each. As of December 31, 2020, two sites — the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and a former chemical plant in Ohio (both of which are indemnified by Maxus Energy Corporation, as discussed further below) — accounted for 92% of its liabilities associated with NPL sites. 17 of the 35 NPL sites are indemnified by Maxus.Five of the 69 third-party sites — a Maxus-indemnified chrome site in New Jersey, a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, a former oil field and a landfill in California, and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities — accounted for 76% of Occidental’s liabilities associated with these sites. 9 of the 69 third-party sites are indemnified by Maxus.Five sites — oil and gas operations in Colorado and chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana, New York and Texas — accounted for 70% of the liabilities associated with the Occidental-operated sites. Seven other sites — a landfill in Western New York, a former refinery in Oklahoma, former chemical plants in California, Michigan, Tennessee and Washington, and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania — accounted for 70% of the liabilities associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.Environmental remediation liabilities vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or divestitures, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation. Occidental recorded environmental remediation expenses of $36 million, $112 million and $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Environmental remediation expenses primarily relate to changes to existing conditions from past operations. Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 45% of the year-end remediation balance over the next three to four years with the remainder over the subsequent 10 or more years. Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those amounts currently recorded for environmental remediation for all of its environmental sites could be up to $1.1 billion.46OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISMAXUS ENVIRONMENTAL SITESWhen Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site (Site) along a portion of the Passaic River. On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware. Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Site.In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River. The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay. During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus’s bankruptcy filing, Occidental and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD at an estimated cost of $165 million. The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties.Occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and remediation called for in the AOC and the ROD, as well as for certain other Maxus-indemnified sites. Occidental's accrued estimated environmental reserve does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs. Occidental’s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount, and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of Occidental's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties. Occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD and to perform remediation at other Maxus-indemnified sites in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties. In June 2018, Occidental filed a complaint under CERCLA in Federal District Court in the State of New Jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties for reimbursement of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the AOC, the ROD, or to perform other remediation activities at the Site.In June 2017, the court overseeing the Maxus bankruptcy approved a Plan of Liquidation (Plan) to liquidate Maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against current and former parents YPF and each of its respective subsidiaries and affiliates (YPF) and Repsol, S.A. and each of its respective subsidiaries and affiliates (Repsol), as well as others to satisfy claims by Occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs. In July 2017, the court-approved Plan became final and the trust became effective. The trust is pursuing claims against YPF, Repsol and others and is expected to distribute assets to Maxus' creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and Plan. In June 2018, the trust filed its complaint against YPF and Repsol in Delaware bankruptcy court asserting claims based upon, among other things, fraudulent transfer and alter ego. During 2019, the bankruptcy court denied Repsol's and YPF's motions to dismiss the complaint as well as their motions to move the case away from the bankruptcy court. Discovery remains ongoing at the time of this report.ENVIRONMENTAL COSTSOccidental’s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:millions202020192018Operating Expenses Oil and gas$176 $174 $91 Chemical73 80 80 Midstream and marketing4 12 10 Total$253 $266 $181 Capital ExpendituresOil and gas$74 $109 $71 Chemical40 34 23 Midstream and marketing1 4 2 Total$115 $147 $96 Remediation ExpensesCorporate$36 $112 $47 Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.

Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts. The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management’s judgment.OIL AND GAS PROPERTIESThe carrying value of Occidental’s property, plant and equipment (PP&E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations (AROs) and capitalized interest, net of DD&A and any impairment charges. For assets acquired in a business combination, PP&E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date. Asset retirement obligations and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. For exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and operating viability of the project. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether Occidental is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological and geophysical costs as incurred for exploration activities.Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method. It amortizes leasehold acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, 48OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISregardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of economic producibility is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures.Several factors could change Occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves. For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit. Occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Generally, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices. In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental’s control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves. Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded. Changes in the political and regulatory climate could lead to decreases in proved reserves as development horizons may be extended into the future. Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable. If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management’s plans, or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment. Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period. Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants. The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time. These assumptions include estimates of future production, product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas proved and unproved reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs. It is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in additional impairments.For impairment testing, unless prices are contractually fixed, Occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows. Future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves. Market prices for oil, NGL and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Changes in global supply and demand, transportation capacity, currency exchange rates, applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts. Future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly. Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $18.6 billion at December 31, 2020, and $29.5 billion at December 31, 2019. The unproved amounts are not subject to DD&A until they are classified as proved properties. Individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms, success rates and other factors to provide for full amortization upon lease expiration or abandonment. Significant unproved properties, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, are assessed individually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recovered a valuation allowance is provided if an impairment is indicated. Occidental periodically reviews significant unproved properties for impairments; numerous factors are considered, including but not limited to, availability of funds for future exploration and development activities, current exploration and development plans, favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property, geologists’ evaluation of the property, the current and projected political and regulatory climate, contractual conditions and the remaining lease term for the properties. If an impairment is indicated, Occidental will first determine whether a comparable transaction for similar properties or implied acreage valuation derived from domestic onshore market participants is available and will adjust the carrying amount of the unproved property to its fair value using the market approach. In situations where the market approach is not observable and unproved reserves are available, undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on managements’ risk adjusted estimates of unproved reserves, future commodity prices and future costs to produce the reserves. If undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. Occidental utilizes the same assumptions and methodology discussed above for cash flows associated with proved properties. OXY 2020 FORM 10-K49MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISPROVED RESERVESOccidental estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC and Financial Accounting Standards Board. This definition includes oil, NGL and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Occidental’s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments.The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental’s oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD&A rate. For example, a 5% increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD&A rate by approximately $0.80/Bbl, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $330 million annually at current production rates. FAIR VALUESOccidental estimates fair-value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets and initial measurements of AROs.Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value.Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs. When estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, Occidental must apply various assumptions.FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIESOccidental utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:■Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date. These derivatives are classified as using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities (Level 1).■Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, international exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities (Level 2) and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.■Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as using unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the valuation hierarchy.■Occidental values debt using market-observable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets. For debt instruments that are not traded, the fair value is determined by interpolating the value based on debt with similar terms and credit risk.50OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISNON-FINANCIAL ASSETSOccidental uses market-observable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued. When Occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions. The cost approach is based on management’s best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management’s best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment. The results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates and other factors, most of which are often outside of management’s control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant’s view of long-term prices, costs and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in Occidental’s business plans and investment decisions. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURESEnvironmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Occidental records environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements. Occidental bases its environmental remediation liabilities on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective. Occidental periodically reviews its environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available. Occidental records environmental remediation liabilities on a discounted basis when it deems the aggregate amount and timing of cash payments to be reliably determinable at the time the reserves are established. The reserve methodology with respect to discounting for a specific site is not modified once it is established. Presently none of its environmental remediation liabilities are recorded on a discounted basis. Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.Many factors could affect Occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses. The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental’s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs. In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental’s ultimate share of liability. Occidental records its environmental remediation liabilities at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at CERCLA NPL sites, Occidental’s environmental remediation liabilities include management’s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems. If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its environmental remediation liabilities accordingly.If Occidental were to adjust the balance of its environmental remediation liabilities based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings. For example, if the balance were reduced by 10%, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $115 million. If the balance were increased by 10%, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $115 million.INCOME TAXESOccidental files various U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns. The impact of changes in tax regulations are reflected when enacted. In general, deferred federal, state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Occidental routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. If Occidental concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the OXY 2020 FORM 10-K51MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISdeferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Occidental recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense (benefit). Occidental uses the flow-through method to account for its investment tax credits. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.LOSS CONTINGENCIESOccidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits. Occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Management’s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management’s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings, or other factors. See Note 11 - Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGESSee Note 2 - Accounting and Disclosure Changes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on significant accounting and disclosure changes.SAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATAPortions of this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, and they include, but are not limited to: any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items or future financial position or sources of financing; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations or business strategy; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Words such as “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “aim,” “goal,” “target,” “objective,” “likely” or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes are generally indicative of forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update, modify or withdraw any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Although Occidental believes that the expectations reflected in any of its forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially. Factors that could cause results to differ from those projected or assumed in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic; Occidental’s indebtedness and other payment obligations, including the need to generate sufficient cash flows to fund operations; Occidental’s ability to successfully monetize select assets, repay or refinance debt and the impact of changes in Occidental’s credit ratings; assumptions about energy markets; global and local commodity and commodity-futures pricing fluctuations, such as the sharp decline in crude oil prices that occurred in the first half of 2020; supply and demand considerations for, and the prices of, Occidental’s products and services; actions by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries; results from operations and competitive conditions; future impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties or equity investments, or write-downs of productive assets, causing charges to earnings; unexpected changes in costs; availability of capital resources, levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations; the regulatory approval environment, including Occidental's ability to timely obtain or maintain permits or other governmental approvals, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects; Occidental's ability to successfully complete, or any material delay of, field developments, expansion projects, capital expenditures, efficiency projects, acquisitions or dispositions; risks associated with acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures, such as difficulties integrating businesses, uncertainty associated with financial projections, projected synergies, restructuring, increased costs and adverse tax consequences; uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested properties and businesses; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves; lower-than-expected production from development projects or acquisitions; 52OXY 2020 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOccidental’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes and improve Occidental’s competitiveness; exploration, drilling and other operational risks; disruptions to, capacity constraints in, or other limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver Occidental’s oil and natural gas and other processing and transportation considerations; general economic conditions, including slowdowns, domestically or internationally, and volatility in the securities, capital or credit markets; uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and transition to any other interest rate benchmark; governmental actions and political conditions and events; legislative or regulatory changes, including changes relating to hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operations, retroactive royalty or production tax regimes, deepwater and onshore drilling and permitting regulations and environmental regulation (including regulations related to climate change); environmental risks and liability under international, provincial, federal, regional, state, tribal, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations (including remedial actions); potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; disruption or interruption of production or manufacturing or facility damage due to accidents, chemical releases, labor unrest, weather, natural disasters, cyber attacks or insurgent activity; the creditworthiness and performance of Occidental's counterparties, including financial institutions, operating partners and other parties; failure of risk management; Occidental’s ability to retain and hire key personnel; reorganization or restructuring of Occidental’s operations; changes in state, federal or foreign tax rates; and actions by third parties that are beyond Occidental's control. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and recent market decline may make it more difficult to identify potential risks, give rise to risks that are currently unknown or amplify the impact of known risks.Additional information concerning these and other factors that may cause Occidental’s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations can be found in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as in Occidental’s other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including Occidental’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKGENERALOccidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices. Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental’s pre-tax annual income by approximately $200 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $85 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.10 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental’s pre-tax income of approximately $35 million. These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental’s results to prices also will change. Marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil, natural gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities. A $0.25 change in the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads impacts total year operating cash flows by $65 million.Occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices. A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively. A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $30 million. Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins.Occidental uses derivative instruments, including a combination of short-term futures, forwards, options and swaps, to obtain the average prices for the relevant production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas.RISK MANAGEMENTOccidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies. The controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check. Members of the risk management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer. Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, reporting to senior management on various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.FAIR VALUE OF MARKETING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTSOccidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value. Fair values for these contracts are derived from Level 1 and Level 2 sources. The fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant. OXY 2020 FORM 10-K53QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESThe following table shows the fair value of Occidental’s derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:Maturity Periods Source of Fair Value Assets/(Liabilities)millions20212022 and 20232024 and 20252026 and thereafterTotalPrices actively quoted$(97)$— $— $— $(97)Prices provided by other external sources(1)2 — — 1 Total$(98)$2 $— $— $(96)QUANTITATIVE INFORMATIONOccidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities. This measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95% level of confidence. Additionally, Occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice. As a result of these controls, Occidental believes that the market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance.INTEREST RATE RISKGENERALOccidental acquired interest rate swap contracts in the Acquisition. Occidental pays a fixed interest rate and receives a floating interest rate indexed to three-month LIBOR. The swaps have an initial term of 30 years with mandatory termination dates in September 2021 through 2023 and a total notional amount of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, Occidental had a net liability of approximately $1.4 billion based on the fair value of the swaps of negative $1.8 billion netted against $374 million in posted cash collateral. A 25-basis point decrease in implied LIBOR rates over the term of the swaps would result in an additional liability of approximately $173 million on these swaps.As of December 31, 2020, Occidental had variable rate debt with a notional value of $1.1 billion outstanding. A 25-basis point increase in LIBOR interest rates would increase gross interest expense approximately $3 million per year.As of December 31, 2020, Occidental had fixed rate debt with a fair value of $32.7 billion outstanding. A 25-basis point change in Treasury rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt approximately $600 million.TABULAR PRESENTATION OF INTEREST RATE RISKThe table below provides information about Occidental’s long-term debt obligations.

Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes. A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars. Additionally, all of Occidental’s consolidated 54OXY 2020 FORM 10-KQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESinternational oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of foreign currency derivatives used in the marketing operations was immaterial. The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income.CREDIT RISKThe majority of Occidental’s counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and any inability of these customers to meet their settlement commitments. Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate. Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. Occidental also enters into futures contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis.Certain OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each party would need to post. The fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-contingent features, that were net liabilities at December 31, 2020 was $104 million (net of $374 million collateral) and $787 million (net of $169 million collateral) at December 31, 2019. Credit-risk-contingent features are primarily related to interest rate swaps.As of December 31, 2020, the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties. Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses at December 31, 2020, was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS HELD FOR NON-TRADING PURPOSESAs of December 31, 2020, Occidental had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future oil production of 350Mbbl/d. As of December 31, 2020, these derivative instruments were at a $42 million net derivative liability position.The following table shows a sensitivity analysis based on both a 5% and 10% change in commodity prices and their effect on the net derivative liability position of $42 million at December 31, 2020:millions except percentagesPercent change in commodity pricesResulting net fair value position-asset (liability)Change to fair value from December 31, 2020 position+ 5%$(67)$(25)- 5%$(26)$16 + 10%$(102)$(60)-10%$(15)$27 As of December 31, 2020, Occidental had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future gas production of 530 thousand MMbtu/d.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8 and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Part 1, Item 1A.INDEXPAGECurrent Business Outlook and Strategy22Oil and Gas Segment25Chemical Segment34Midstream and Marketing Segment35Segment Results of Operations and Items Affecting Comparability37Income Taxes41Consolidated Results of Operations42Liquidity and Capital Resources44Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies47Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures48Global Investments50Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates51Safe Harbor Discussion Regarding Outlook and Other Forward-Looking Data55OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 21MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND STRATEGYGENERALOccidental’s operations, financial condition, cash flows and levels of expenditures are highly dependent on oil prices and, to a lesser extent, NGL and natural gas prices, the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads and the prices it receives for its chemical products. During 2021, as compared to 2020, the average annual price per barrel ($/Bbl) of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude increased to $67.91 from $39.40 and the average annual Brent price per barrel increased to $70.78 from $43.21. While the worldwide economy continues to be impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, demand for oil has returned to near pre-pandemic levels. Current uncertainty of whether oil supply will be able to sustain a continued supply response, as well as geopolitical risks, have resulted in a significant increase to benchmark oil prices. In addition, current oil prices could be negatively impacted by the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, slow vaccine distribution in developing economies or the recurrence or tightening of travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders. STRATEGYOccidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition with its integrated portfolio of oil and gas, chemicals and midstream and marketing assets and its commitment to implement carbon management and storage solutions and reduce GHG emissions. Occidental conducts its operations with a focus on sustainability, health, safety, and environmental and social responsibility. Occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of:■Enhancing capital and operational efficiency to sustain 2021 production levels and free cash flow;■Reducing financial leverage while maintaining a robust liquidity position;■Returning additional capital to shareholders while continuing to reduce debt and improve Occidental’s financial position; and■Advancing technologies and business solutions to help drive a sustainable low-carbon future.OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND CAPITAL EFFICIENCY Occidental's operational priorities for 2021 were to sustain production in-line with its 2020 fourth quarter rate by investing $2.9 billion in capital and maintaining a majority of the cost savings achieved in 2020. Occidental adhered to its capital budget and exceeded its original 2021 production guidance by 27 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d). Occidental set new operational records and efficiency benchmarks in the Permian, Rockies, Gulf of Mexico and Oman. Additionally, OxyChem recorded its highest earnings in 30 years, largely as a result of stronger realized pricing and margins across most product lines with improved demand. With the increase in commodity prices and Occidental’s focus on its cash costs and operational efficiencies, Occidental’s higher cash flow allowed it to reduce its leverage and improve its liquidity position. DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS Occidental used its excess cash flow generated during 2021, coupled with divestiture proceeds, to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing its debt and other financial obligations. In 2021, Occidental reduced total borrowings at face value of over $6.7 billion and retired interest rate swaps with a notional value of $750 million. The 2021 balance sheet improvement efforts have significantly reduced debt maturities in the near and medium terms, which will allow Occidental more operational flexibility and the ability to pay down additional debt in the future with a more opportunistic approach. As of December 31, 2021, Occidental had debt maturities of approximately $101 million in 2022, $465 million in 2023 and $1.7 billion in 2024. In January 2022, Occidental paid off its last 2022 maturity for $101 million. Occidental’s $2.3 billion Zero Coupon senior notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons) can be put to Occidental in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons. The Zero Coupons can next be put to Occidental in October 2022, which, if put in whole, would require a payment of approximately $1.1 billion at such date. Occidental currently has the intent and ability to meet this obligation, including, if necessary, using amounts available under the revolving credit facility (RCF) should the put right be exercised. The remaining interest rate swaps with a fair value of $428 million, net of collateral, as of December 31, 2021, have mandatory termination dates in September 2022 and 2023. The interest rate swaps’ fair value, and cash required to settle them on their termination dates, will continue to fluctuate with changes in interest rates through the mandatory termination dates.As of December 31, 2021, all of Occidental’s Brent-priced sold calls and two way natural gas collars have expired. See Note 8 - Derivatives in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.22 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDEBT RATINGS As of the date of this filing, Occidental’s long-term debt was rated BB+ by Fitch Ratings, Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service and BB+ by Standard and Poor’s. In January, 2022, Standard and Poor’s upgraded Occidental’s credit rating to BB+. Any downgrade in credit ratings could impact Occidental's ability to access capital markets and increase its cost of capital. Occidental’s non-investment grade debt rating may require Occidental to provide financial assurance in the form of cash, letters of credit, surety bonds or other acceptable support under certain contractual arrangements.As of the date of this filing, Occidental has provided required financial assurance through a combination of cash, letters of credit and surety bonds. Occidental has not issued any letters of credit under the RCF or other committed facilities. For additional information, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP STRATEGYIn 2020, Occidental was the first U.S. oil and gas company to announce goals to achieve net-zero GHG emissions for its total emissions inventory including use of sold products. These goals include achieving net-zero GHG emissions (i) from its operations and energy use before 2040, with an ambition to do so before 2035, and (ii) from the use of its sold products with an ambition to do so before 2050. In 2020, Occidental also set various interim targets, including 2025 carbon and methane intensity targets, and Occidental was also the first U.S. oil and gas company to endorse the World Bank’s initiative for zero routine flaring by 2030. In 2021, Occidental made progress on these sustainability commitments and established additional interim targets toward its net-zero goals to advance a low-carbon future. Occidental seeks to meet its sustainability and environmental goals through its development and commercialization of technologies that lower both GHG emissions from industrial processes and existing atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Occidental believes that carbon removal technologies, including DAC and CCUS, can, with incentives necessary for their development and deployment, provide essential CO2 reductions in the medium term, while the world transitions to a lower carbon intensive economy. Occidental has undertaken the following actions, among others, toward advancing its low-carbon strategy:■Incorporated specific GHG emissions reduction targets in its RCF and receivables securitization facility, which can impact its costs related to its borrowing facilities;■Invested in a third party to develop a zero-emission natural gas generation demonstration facility and license the underlying technology;■Initiated a front end engineering and design study on an industrial scale DAC facility; ■Implemented multiple programs to reduce emissions and the routine flaring of gas; ■Delivered the world’s first cargo of carbon-neutral oil in January 2021; ■Formed teams to specifically advance Occidental’s environmental, social and governance goals and associated accounting, and report to executive management; and■Provided technical advisory services to third parties regarding their CCUS projects.In 2022, OLCV plans to invest approximately $300 million in the development and commercialization of new technologies and low-carbon business models. In addition, Occidental plans to invest approximately $83 million in emissions reduction capital projects at its existing oil and gas, chemical and other midstream operations in 2022, such as retrofitting facilities to reduce CO2, methane and other air emissions. The future costs associated with emissions reduction, carbon removal and CCUS to meet its long-term net-zero GHG goals may be substantial and execution of its plans depends on securing financing. Occidental is pursuing multiple pathways to finance these projects including: ■Project financing with long-term carbon removal or CCUS agreements;■Identifying business opportunities with stakeholders in carbon-intensive industries; and■Occidental self-funding with excess cash flow.LIQUIDITYOccidental exited 2021 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion and total borrowings at face value of $28.5 billion. Occidental undertook the following actions to improve its liquidity position beyond the improvements provided by 2021’s strong cash flows:■Maintained its 2021 capital budget of $2.9 billion while exceeding production guidance;■Maintained the majority of cost savings achieved in prior years;■Completed its large-scale asset divestiture program;■Amended and extended the RCF to June 2025 with a fully committed borrowing capacity of $4.0 billion. The amended facility is now a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) priced, sustainability linked loan with no material change to existing covenants; and■Amended and extended the receivables securitization facility to December 2024 with a borrowing capacity as of the date of this filing of $400 million. The amended facility is now a SOFR-priced, sustainability linked loan.OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 23MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISIn the current commodity price environment, Occidental intends to continue strengthening its financial position while returning additional cash to shareholders through an increase in the common dividend and a reactivated share repurchase program. Occidental expects to fund its return of capital to shareholders as well as its operational and capital requirements with cash flows from operations. Occidental will continue to evaluate the economic environment, as well as the commodity price environment, and may make further adjustments to its future levels of capital expenditures and operating and corporate costs. However, lower oil and gas prices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or reduced demand may result in the short or long-term reduction of Occidental’s capital expenditures and production profile. Occidental believes the long-term sustainability of the increased dividend rate, even in a lower oil and gas price environment, will be enhanced by continued deleveraging and the reactivated share repurchase program. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORSOccidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success against key performance indicators that drive total stockholder return. In addition to efficient capital allocation and deployment discussed below in the section titled Oil and Gas Segment - Business Strategy, Occidental believes the following are its most significant performance indicators:SAFETY ■Injury Incidence Rate (IIR) and Days Away Restricted Transfer (DART) rate - Occidental’s combined employee and contractor IIR is determined by multiplying the total number of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable injuries and illnesses by 200,000 and dividing that result by the total number of hours worked by all employees and contractors. The DART rate is calculated in the same manner as IIR, but uses the number of incidents that resulted in days away from work, job transfer or restricted job duties instead of the number of recordable injuries or illnesses.OPERATIONAL■Total spend per barrel - In 2022, Occidental will continue to focus on controlling total costs from a per-barrel perspective. Total spend per barrel is the sum of capital spending, general and administrative expenses, other operating and non-operating expenses and oil and gas lease operating costs divided by global oil, NGL and natural gas sales volumes.■Daily production - Occidental seeks to maintain 2021 production levels. FINANCIAL■Cash returns on capital employed (CROCE) - CROCE is calculated as (i) the cash flows from operating activities, before changes in working capital, plus distributions from WES classified as investing cash flows, divided by (ii) the average of the opening and closing balances of total equity plus total debt.■Reduce financial leverage.SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL■Specific emissions reduction, emissions intensity and zero routine flaring targets to advance our goal of net-zero operational and energy use emissions before 2040, with an ambition to achieve before 2035.■Milestones in specific carbon removal and CCUS projects that advance our net-zero total emissions inventory, including use of sold products, with an ambition to achieve before 2050.■Water recycling targets to reduce the use of fresh water resources and the disposal of surplus produced water.■Facilitate deployment of carbon removal, CCUS and other solutions to advance total carbon impact past 2050.IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMICOccidental continues to focus on protecting the health and safety of its employees and contractors during the COVID-19 pandemic. New workplace safety protocols and procedures were implemented by Occidental for its offices and work sites in response to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and any related variants. Occidental has not incurred material costs or significant disruptions to its day-to-day operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic to date; however, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect Occidental's business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which remain uncertain.24 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOIL AND GAS SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYOccidental’s oil and gas segment focuses on long-term value creation and leadership in sustainability, health, safety and the environment. In each core operating area, Occidental’s operations benefit from scale, technical expertise, decades of high-margin inventory, environmental and safety leadership and commercial and governmental collaboration. These attributes allow Occidental to bring additional production quickly to market, extend the life of older fields at lower costs and provide low-cost returns-driven growth opportunities with advanced technology. With the completion of the Acquisition, Occidental became one of the largest U.S. producers of liquids, which includes oil and NGL, allowing Occidental to maximize cash margins on a Bbl basis. Since the Acquisition, Occidental initially focused on its divestiture program to pay down near-term debt maturities; however, the advantages that Occidental’s portfolio provides, coupled with unmatched subsurface characterization ability and the proven ability to execute, position Occidental for full-cycle success in the years ahead. The oil and gas segment has realized synergies to deliver lower breakeven costs and generate excess free cash flow and, with the late 2021 sale of the Ghana assets, Occidental has completed its large scale asset divestiture program.Occidental’s assets are strategically positioned to provide a future portfolio of projects that are flexible and have a mix of short-cycle and mid-cycle investment paybacks. Together with Occidental’s technical capabilities, the oil and gas segment strives to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize full-cycle value of the assets.The oil and gas business implements Occidental’s strategy primarily by:■Operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and optimizing capital intensity in core areas, primarily in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico, UAE, Oman and Algeria;■Maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach to capital expenditures with a focus on high-return, short-cycle, cash-flow-generating opportunities and an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing Occidental’s existing positions;■Focusing Occidental’s subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities, primarily in the Permian Basin;■Using EOR techniques, such as CO2, water and steam floods in mature fields; and■Focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies and innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions.In 2021, oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately $2.4 billion and primarily focused on Occidental’s assets in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and Oman.OIL AND GAS PRICE ENVIRONMENTOil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance. The following table presents the average daily WTI and Brent prices for oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices for 2021 and 2020:20212020% ChangeWTI Oil ($/Bbl)$67.91 $39.40 72 %Brent Oil ($/Bbl)$70.78 $43.21 64 %NYMEX Natural Gas ($/Mcf)$3.61 $2.11 71 %The following table presents Occidental’s average realized prices for continuing operations as a percentage of WTI, Brent and NYMEX for 2021 and 2020:20212020Worldwide oil as a percentage of average WTI97 %95 %Worldwide oil as a percentage of average Brent93 %86 %Worldwide NGL as a percentage of average WTI44 %32 %Worldwide NGL as a percentage of average Brent42 %29 %Domestic natural gas as a percentage of NYMEX91 %56 %/Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making it difficult to predict realized prices with a reliable degree of certainty.OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 25MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDOMESTIC INTERESTSBUSINESS REVIEWOccidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns, or a combination of both. Occidental’s domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to 10 years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences. Occidental has leasehold and mineral interests in 9.5 million net acres, of which approximately 52% is leased, 24% is owned subsurface mineral rights and 24% is owned land with mineral rights. DOMESTIC ASSETS (a)1. Powder River Basin2. DJ Basin3. Permian Basin4. Gulf of Mexico(a)Map represents geographic outlines of the respective basins.The Permian Basin The Permian Basin extends throughout West Texas and Southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for more than 41% of total United States oil production in 2021. Overall in 2021, Occidental’s share of production in the Permian Basin was approximately 487 Mboe/d. Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two business units: Permian Resources, which includes unconventional opportunities, and Permian EOR, which utilizes EOR techniques such as CO2 floods and waterfloods. Occidental has a leading position in the Permian Basin, producing approximately 9% of total oil in the basin throughout 2021. By exploiting the natural synergies between Permian Resources and Permian EOR, Occidental is able to deliver unique short- and long-term advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its Permian Basin operations. Permian Resources unconventional oil development projects provide very short-cycle investment payback, averaging less than two years. These investments contribute cash flow, while increasing long-term value and sustainability through higher return on capital employed. Occidental’s oil and gas operations in Permian Resources include approximately 1.5 million net acres. In 2021, well design processes, technologies and logistics improvements drove increased operational efficiencies, which helped lower the overall well cost while improving recovery. Overall in 2021, Permian Resources produced from approximately 6,000 gross wells and added 222 MMboe to Occidental’s proved reserves through development and extensions of proved area.The Permian Basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs, favorable CO2 flooding performance and the expansive CO2 transportation and processing infrastructure has resulted in decades of high-value enhanced oil production. With 35 active CO2 floods and over 50 years of experience, Occidental is the industry leader in Permian Basin CO2 flooding, which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10% to 25%. Technology improvements, such as the recent trend toward vertical expansion of the CO2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets, continue to yield more recovery from existing projects, and Permian EOR produced from approximately 14,100 gross wells in 2021.Significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding Occidental’s existing CO2 projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been water-flooded. Permian EOR has a large inventory of future CO2 projects, 26 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISwhich could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions. In addition, OLCV continues making progress towards supplying anthropogenic CO2 for the purpose of CCUS in Occidental’s Permian EOR operations.In 2021, Occidental spent approximately $1.1 billion of capital in the Permian Basin, of which approximately 93% was spent on Permian Resources assets. Also in 2021, Occidental divested of certain non-strategic assets in the Permian Resources business unit, as well as acquired additional working interests in certain assets in our Permian EOR business unit. In 2022, Occidental expects to allocate approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, or almost half of its worldwide capital budget to the Permian Basin.Rockies and Other DomesticOccidental was Colorado’s top oil and gas producer in 2021, with interests in approximately 600,000 net acres and net production of approximately 302 Mboe/d in 2021 in our Rockies and Other Domestic locations. Production in Colorado is derived from 2,200 operated vertical wells and 2,300 operated horizontal wells primarily focused in 400,000 net acres in the Niobrara and Codell formations. The DJ Basin provides competitive economics, low breakeven costs and free cash flow generation through Occidental’s contiguous acreage position and royalty uplift.In the DJ Basin, horizontal drilling results in the field continue to be strong, with improved operational efficiencies in drilling and completions. In 2021, Occidental drilled 72 operated horizontal wells and completed 163 operated horizontal wells. Also, in 2021, Occidental divested of certain non-operated assets in the DJ Basin. In 2022, Occidental plans to deploy approximately $0.4 billion in total net capital spending in the Rockies and Other Domestic.In January 2021, the COGCC adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements, or “setbacks,” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures. Other state agencies, including the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, have also updated their regulations regarding oil and gas operations. As of December 31, 2021, Occidental is fully permitted, or has submitted permit applications to applicable regulatory agencies, for all planned 2022 drilling and completions activity in the DJ Basin. As of year-end 2021, Occidental had not been denied any permits and received its first Oil & Gas Development Plan permit approval under the new COGCC regulations in the fourth quarter of 2021. Occidental has a dedicated, multidisciplinary stakeholder relations team that conducts regulatory and community outreach with respect to its permit applications and operations in Colorado. Occidental continues to have development optionality by flexing resources between the DJ Basin and other high rate-of-return projects in the Permian or Powder River Basin. Occidental’s focus for 2022 in Colorado is continuing to proactively implement Colorado’s new and updated regulatory processes and build operational inventory.Occidental has gained efficiencies in the permitting process and will continue to look for additional opportunities to do so. As discussed above, Occidental does not anticipate significant near-term changes to our development program in the DJ Basin based on these regulations. However, if Occidental is unable to obtain new drilling permits to develop a significant portion of the company’s undeveloped acreage in the DJ Basin, the company’s DJ Basin assets may be subject to testing for impairment, and if deemed to be impaired, such impairment could be material to our financial statements.Occidental holds approximately 5.0 million net acres in other domestic locations, which includes the Powder River Basin, North DJ Basin and Wyoming.OFFSHORE DOMESTIC ASSETSGulf of MexicoOccidental is the fourth-largest oil and gas producer in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico, operating 10 strategically located deep-water floating platforms, producing from 17 active fields while owning a working interest in 180 blocks – one of the largest portfolios in the Gulf of Mexico. Occidental further operates marine shore-bases in Galveston, Texas, and Port Fourchon, Louisiana, as well as two helicopter bases in Louisiana that are configured to support the western and eastern Gulf operations, which are located across the 600-mile platform spread as well as providing back up and redundancy to each other. A central supply chain base, with a training center, is located in Broussard, Louisiana, and the operations are supported and managed with engineering and technical staff from The Woodlands, Texas, offices. In 2021, Occidental increased net production to 144 Mboe/d from approximately 78 gross wells, investing over $300 million in capital, primarily directed towards drilling activity in its Horn Mountain West subsea development, Lucius and Holstein facilities, using one floating drill ship and one platform rig. Occidental also progressed and accelerated key infrastructure facility projects for Horn Mountain West, Caesar-Tonga Subsea Expansion as well as initiating a major subsea-pumping project supporting the K2 Complex.Operational excellence and efficiency was a prime initiative in 2021 for both drilling and well performance, including the implementation of several stimulations and artificial lift projects, together with optimum sequencing of platform turn-arounds, to reduce both planned and unplanned downtime for a third consecutive year. Hazard and operability studies of all 10 platforms were completed in 2021 and implementation of the resulting risk reduction projects was commenced. During 2021, all necessary regulatory permits for new wells and for existing operations were obtained timely.OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 27MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe following table shows areas of continuing development in the Gulf of Mexico, along with the corresponding working interest in those areas.Working InterestHorn Mountain100 %Holstein100 %Marlin100 %Lucius64 %K2 Complex42 %Caesar Tonga34 %Constellation33 %In 2022, Occidental expects to allocate approximately $0.5 billion in capital expenditures to continue to leverage its strategically advantaged infrastructure across the Gulf of Mexico to deliver high-margin production while seeking expansion and exploration opportunities. Occidental plans to conduct production adding activities with one floating drillship, one-to-two platform rigs with several other well service vessels. Horn Mountain West first production is scheduled for summer 2022, with Caesar-Tonga Subsea Expansion ready for first production before spring 2023. Several seismic acquisition programs are planned in 2022 to delineate and de-risk development opportunities as well as generate new opportunities that support the strategy of continued long-term production from the Gulf of Mexico.INTERNATIONAL INTERESTSBUSINESS REVIEWOccidental conducts its ongoing international operations in two sub-regions: the Middle East and North Africa. Its activities include oil, NGL and natural gas production through direct working-interests, production sharing agreements (PSA) and production sharing contracts (PSC). Under the PSCs, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Overall, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher. Approximately $0.5 billion of Occidental’s worldwide capital budget is expected to be allocated to its international operations in 2022.MIDDLE EAST / NORTH AFRICA ASSETS1.Algeria2.Oman3.Qatar4.UAE28 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISAlgeriaOperations in Algeria involve production and development activities in 18 fields within Blocks 404A and 208, which are located in the Berkine Basin in Algeria’s Sahara Desert and are governed by an agreement between Occidental, Sonatrach and other partners. Occidental is responsible for 24.5% of the development and production costs. The El Merk Central Processing Facility (CPF) in Block 208 processes produced oil and NGL, while the Hassi Berkine South and Ourhoud CPFs in Block 404A processes produced oil. The rights to produce from the Block 404 fields expire between December 2022 and 2036 and the rights to produce from the Block 208 fields expire in 2032. In 2021, net production in Algeria was 43 Mbbl/d. Also, in 2021, Occidental signed a Heads of Agreement with Sonatrach and other partners to discuss a new 25-year PSA that would align the expiration date for all 18 fields. Discussions regarding the potential new PSA are ongoing. In the first quarter of 2022, the joint venture plans to commence a drilling program of four wells. OmanIn Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9 with a 50% working interest, Block 27 with a 65% working interest, Block 53 (Mukhaizna Field) with a 47% working interest and Block 62 with a 100% working interest. Occidental additionally has interests in Blocks 30, 51, 65 and 72. Occidental holds 6.0 million gross acres and has 10,000 potential well inventory locations. In 2021, Occidentals share of production was 74 Mboe/d.The Block 9 contract expires in 2030 and the Block 27 contract expires in 2035. Occidental’s share of production for Blocks 9 and 27 was 25 Mboe/d and 6 Mboe/d, respectively, in 2021. Occidental has produced over 718 million gross barrels from Block 9 since the beginning of its operation through successful exploration, continuous drilling improvements and EOR projects. The Mukhaizna Field contract expires in 2035 and is a major pattern steam flood project for EOR that utilizes some of the largest mechanical vapor compressors ever built. Since assuming operations in the Mukhaizna Field in 2005, Occidental has drilled over 3,560 new wells and has increased gross production by over 15-fold. Occidental’s share of production for Mukhaizna Field was 30 Mboe/d in 2021. The Block 62 contract expires in 2028 and Occidental delivered production of 12 Mboe/d in 2021. Block 65 is under the exploration phase with a 73% working interest and Occidental’s share of production in 2021 was one Mboe/d based on three oil discoveries. In 2021, Occidental invested capital of $363 million to drill 111 wells and execute facilities projects to support development and EOR activities.In 2022, Occidental plans to invest over $0.3 billion of capital to drill 128 wells and execute required facilities projects. Occidental will continue to enhance production by adding extended and dual laterals, stimulating wells with OXY JETTING, an in-house developed stimulation technique, and expanding thermal conformance. Occidental will continue to execute projects in Oman targeting emissions reductions. Based on the successful exploration results in Block 65 for 2021, the block’s Declaration of Commerciality is planned for 2022.QatarIn Qatar, Occidental partners in the Dolphin Energy Project, an investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests. Occidental has a 24.5% interest in the upstream operations (Dolphin) to develop and produce NGL, natural gas and condensate from Qatar’s North Field through mid-2032. Occidental also has a 24.5% interest in DEL, which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in the midstream and marketing segment section in this Form 10-K under Pipeline. In 2021, Occidental’s net share of production from Dolphin was 40 Mboe/d.UAEIn 2011, Occidental acquired a 40% participating interest in the Shah gas field (Al Hosn Gas), joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, which expires in 2041. In 2021, Occidental’s share of production from Al Hosn Gas was 234 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas and 37 Mbbl/d of NGL and condensate. Al Hosn Gas includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in the midstream and marketing segment section in this Form 10-K under Gas Processing, Gathering and CO2. In 2019 and 2020, Occidental acquired 9-year exploration concessions and, subject to a declaration of commerciality, 35-year production concessions for Onshore Block 3 and Block 5, which cover an area approximately 1.5 million acres and 1.0 million acres, respectively, and are adjacent to Al Hosn Gas. In 2021, Occidental announced a multi-zone oil and gas discovery in Block 3. In 2022, Occidental plans to continue work on an expansion project that will increase the production capacity of the Al Hosn Gas processing facilities from the current 1.28 Bcf/d to 1.45 Bcf/d in 2023 and continue further exploration activities in Onshore Block 3 and Block 5.Ghana - Discontinued OperationsIn October 2021, Occidental completed the sale of its Ghana assets. Prior to the divestiture, Ghana operations included production and development activities located offshore in the West Cape Three Point Block and the Deepwater Tano Block. Occidental’s net share of production in 2021 was 16 Mboe/d.OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 29MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISPROVED RESERVESProved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. Oil, NGL and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs. The following table shows the 2021, 2020 and 2019 calculated first-day-of-the-month average prices for both WTI and Brent oil prices, as well as the Henry Hub gas prices measured in million British thermal units (MMbtu):202120202019WTI Oil ($/Bbl)$66.56 $39.57 $55.69 Brent Oil ($/Bbl)$69.24 $43.41 $63.03 Henry Hub Natural Gas ($/MMbtu)$3.60 $1.98 $2.58 Mt. Belvieu NGL ($/Bbl) (a)$44.22 $18.74 N/A(a)Mt. Belvieu pricing was added as an NGL benchmark beginning in 2020. Prior to 2020, WTI oil was used as a benchmark for NGL.Occidental had proved reserves from continuing operations at year-end 2021 of 3,512 MMboe, compared to the year-end 2020 amount of 2,911 MMboe. Proved developed reserves represented approximately 75% and 78% of Occidental’s total proved reserves at year-end 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following table shows the breakout of Occidental’s proved reserves from continuing operations by commodity as a percentage of total proved reserves:20212020Oil50 %51 %NGL22 %20 %Natural gas28 %29 %Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources. For further information regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, see the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information section in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.CHANGES IN PROVED RESERVESOccidental’s total proved reserves from continuing operations increased 601 MMboe in 2021, which was primarily driven by price and other revisions of 829 MMboe and extensions and discoveries of 145 MMboe. These increases were partially offset by production of 426 MMboe and asset divestitures of 11 MMboe. Changes in reserves were as follows:MMboe2021Revisions of previous estimates829 Improved recovery20 Extensions and discoveries145 Purchases44 Sales(11)Production(426)Total 601 Occidental’s ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of infill development, extension, discovery and improved recovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect Occidental’s reserves.Revisions of Previous EstimatesRevisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data. In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental. For example, lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations. Offsetting this effect, lower prices increase Occidental’s share of proved reserves under PSCs because more oil is required to recover costs. Conversely, when prices rise, Occidental’s share of proved reserves decreases for PSCs and economically 30 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISrecoverable reserves may increase for other operations. Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease, as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data.In 2021, Occidental’s revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves were positive 829 MMboe, of which approximately 421 MMboe were positive price revisions. The positive price revisions were primarily associated with the Permian Basin (380 MMboe) and the DJ Basin (51 MMboe), which were partially offset by negative price revisions of 35 MMboe on international PSCs.An additional 208 MMboe of positive revisions were related to additions associated with infill development projects, primarily in the Permian Basin (103 MMboe) and the DJ Basin (90 MMboe).Further positive revisions of 101 MMboe were associated with updates based on reservoir performance. The remaining revisions were associated with various other cost related revisions (57 MMboe) and management changes in development plans primarily due to higher average commodity prices compared to the prior year (42 MMboe).Improved RecoveryIn 2021, Occidental added proved reserves of 20 MMboe related to improved recovery primarily due to secondary and tertiary projects, mainly in certain international assets which accounted for approximately two-thirds of the reserve additions. These properties comprise conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO2 flood, waterflood or steam flood. These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration. Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells. The use of either CO2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either CO2 or steam and other economic factors. Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells. Extensions and DiscoveriesOccidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs. In 2021, extensions and discoveries added 145 MMboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the Permian Basin (120 MMboe) and Gulf of Mexico (10 MMboe).Purchases of Proved ReservesIn 2021, Occidental purchased proved reserves of 44 MMboe primarily consisting of proved reserves in the Permian EOR.Sales of Proved ReservesIn 2021, Occidental sold 11 MMboe in proved reserves, primarily related to the divestitures of certain non-strategic assets in the Permian Basin.Proved Undeveloped ReservesOccidental had PUD reserves at year-end 2021 of 865 MMboe, compared to the year-end 2020 amount of 645 MMboe.Changes in PUD reserves were as follows:MMboe2021Revisions of previous estimates280 Improved recovery10 Extensions and discoveries60 Purchases6 Sales— Transfer to proved developed reserves(136)Total220 Revisions of previous estimates were a positive 280 MMboe. Approximately 203 MMboe of the positive revisions were related to additions associated with infill development projects, primarily in the Permian Basin (99 MMboe) and the DJ Basin (90 MMboe). Additionally, the revisions included positive price revisions of 50 MMboe. The positive price revisions were primarily associated with the Permian Basin (48 MMboe) and the DJ Basin (8 MMboe). Further, 38 MMboe of positive revisions were related to management changes in development plans. The remaining revisions were associated with various updates based on reservoir performance. Extensions and discoveries added 60 MMboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the Permian Basin (45 MMboe) and Gulf of Mexico (10 MMboe). Total improved recovery additions of 10 MMboe were primarily the result OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 31MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISof secondary and tertiary projects in international assets (9 MMboe). The 2021 additions to PUD reserves were offset by transfers to proved developed reserves. Transfers to proved developed reserves were a total of 136 MMboe. The transfers were primarily associated with the DJ Basin (70 MMboe), the Permian Basin (41 MMboe), and Gulf of Mexico (18 MMboe). PUD reserves are supported by a five-year detailed field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled. Only PUD reserves which are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan. A portion of the PUD reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development projects.In 2021, Occidental incurred approximately $0.6 billion to convert PUD reserves to proved developed reserves, and in 2021 Occidental converted approximately 15% of its PUD reserves to proved developed, when adjusted for revisions and sales. As of December 31, 2021, Occidental had 865 MMboe of PUD reserves of which 60% were associated with domestic onshore, 8% with Gulf of Mexico and 32% with international assets. Occidental’s most active development areas are located in the Permian Basin, which represented 45% of the PUD reserves as of December 31, 2021. Almost half of Occidental’s 2022 capital program of $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion is allocated to the development program in the Permian Basin. Overall, Occidental plans to spend approximately $3.0 billion over the next five years to develop its PUD reserves in the Permian Basin.As of December 31, 2021, Occidental had 192 MMboe of pre-2017 PUD reserves that remained undeveloped. These PUD reserves relate to approved long-term development plans, 187 MMboe of which are associated with international development projects with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity. Occidental remains committed to these projects and continues to actively progress the development of these volumes. In addition to the above, Occidental has 112 MMboe of PUD reserves that are scheduled to be developed more than five years from their initial date of booking. These PUD reserves are primarily related to approved long-term development plans with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity, 63 MMboe of which are associated with other Permian EOR projects and 38 MMboe associated with international development projects. RESERVES EVALUATION AND REVIEW PROCESSOccidental’s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2021, were made by Occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management. The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves. This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts. As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves. Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type curve analysis, material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes, seismic analysis and computer simulation of the reservoir performance. These reliable field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.Net PUD reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. PUD reserves are supported by a five-year, detailed, field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled. The development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel. Annually, a detailed review is performed by Occidental’s Worldwide Reserves Group and its technical personnel on a lease-by-lease basis to assess whether PUD reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date. Any leases not showing timely transfers from PUD reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and have sufficient capital committed in the development plan. Only PUD reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan. A portion of the PUD reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development plans.The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with SEC rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental’s oil and gas reserves data. He has over 40 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe. He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. He is an American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Certified Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the United Nations 32 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISEconomic Commission for Europe Expert Group on Resource Management. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.Occidental has a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee), consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental’s oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental’s Board of Directors during the year. Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes. For additional reserves information, see Supplemental Oil and Gas Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.In 2021, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2021, in accordance with SEC regulatory standards. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental’s 2021 year-end total proved reserves portfolio. In 2021, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 36% of Occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 91% of Occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves.Management retained Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental. Occidental has filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKThe oil and gas exploration and production industry is highly competitive, is subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions and operations are highly dependent on oil prices and, to a lesser extent, NGL and natural gas prices. Oil prices increased significantly in 2021. During 2021, as compared to 2020, the average annual $/Bbl of WTI crude increased to $67.91 from $39.40 and the average annual Brent price per barrel increased to $70.78 from $43.21.Oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production or supply chain disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and costs in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates and inflation rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.NGL prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids. Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock. In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations, global LNG demand and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.We expect that oil prices in the near-term will continue to be influenced by the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting impact on oil and gas supply and demand. These and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil, NGL and domestic gas prices reliably. For purposes of the current capital plan, Occidental will continue to focus on allocating capital to its highest-return assets with the flexibility to adjust based on fluctuations in commodity prices. International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts. Occidental continues to adjust capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital. The timing, process and ultimate cost to transition to a lower carbon intensive economy remains largely unknown; various industry forecasts indicate a growing demand for hydrocarbons for the remainder of the current decade. Occidental believes its operational flexibility regarding its mix of short-cycle and mid-cycle projects and its knowledge and experience in CO2 separation, transportation, use, recycling and storage means that its oil and gas segment is well positioned to support Occidental’s transition to net zero as well as create opportunities in a low-carbon future. OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 33MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CHEMICAL SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYOxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain, beginning with the co-production of caustic soda and chlorine. Caustic soda and chlorine are marketed to external customers. In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC. OxyChem seeks to be a low-cost producer in order to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns. OxyChem’s focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale. Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets. Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities. In 2021, capital expenditures for OxyChem totaled $308 million.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTIn 2021, the United States economic growth, estimated to be 5.6%, was significantly higher than the 3.4% contraction experienced in 2020, which resulted in higher demand for most products including caustic soda and PVC. Pricing for PVC continued to remain strong in 2021 due to increased domestic demand and record high pricing in global markets. Caustic soda prices were significantly higher in 2021, partially offset by higher energy costs.BUSINESS REVIEWBASIC CHEMICALS The U.S. economic growth resulted in higher domestic demand as chlor-alkali operating rates increased compared to 2020. Liquid caustic soda and chlorine prices/margins were higher in 2021 due to strong demand in most market segments, which was partially offset by higher energy prices. Increases in prices/margins for caustic, chlorine and chlorine derivatives in 2021 versus 2020 was driven by strong demand, weather events and other supply disruptions.VINYLSStrong demand from the second half of 2020 continued into 2021, resulting in an 11% increase in domestic PVC demand. Housing starts, construction projects and low mortgage rates were the main catalyst driving the growth. During 2021, PVC producers were confronted with extended production outages, weather events and supply chain interruptions while PVC converters also experienced challenges due to shortages of labor, parts and raw materials. As with 2020, higher U.S. demand limited PVC availability for export markets. 2021 PVC export volume was down 32% year over year. PVC exports represented 19% of total North American production in 2021 compared to 28% in 2020.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKIndustry performance will depend on the health of the global economy and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The housing, construction and automotive markets are expected to remain strong throughout 2022. Product margins will depend on market supply and demand balances, feedstock and energy prices, supply chain interruptions, labor constraints and rising inflation rates. Further recovery in the petroleum industry should strengthen the demand/margins for some of Occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants. U.S. commodity export markets could be impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar.BASIC CHEMICALSDemand for basic chemicals is expected to further improve in 2022 over 2021 levels. Improvement in most market segments is expected with the anticipated improvement in the overall economy and recovering supply chains. Demand for chlorine and derivatives will improve with continued growth in the housing, general construction and automotive markets. Demand for alkali products, particularly caustic soda, will improve with growth in the pulp and paper, industrial and alumina markets. Chlor-alkali operating rates should improve moderately with higher demand and continued competitive energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs.VINYLSDomestic PVC demand is expected to remain strong with further year-over-year growth in 2022. Residential construction spending and expected new infrastructure projects are forecasted to drive domestic growth in 2022. New domestic PVC capacity is expected to fully enter the market in 2022 but is not expected to have a material impact on PVC production rates due to domestic and export growth expectations.34 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISMIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYThe midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize value by optimizing the use of its gathering, processing, transportation, storage and terminal commitments and by providing the oil and gas segment access to domestic and international markets. To generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to Occidental’s subsidiaries, as well as third parties. The midstream and marketing segment operates or contracts for services on gathering systems, gas plants, co-generation facilities and storage facilities and invests in entities that conduct similar activities.This segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas and power used in Occidental’s various businesses. Capital is employed to sustain or expand assets to improve the competitiveness of Occidental’s businesses. In 2021, capital expenditures related to the midstream and marketing segment totaled $106 million.Also included in the midstream and marketing segment is OLCV. OLCV seeks to leverage Occidental’s carbon management expertise through the development of CCUS projects, and invests in innovative low-carbon technologies that are expected to reduce our carbon footprint and enable others to do the same.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTMidstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses, including its marketing, gathering and transportation, gas processing and power-generation assets. The marketing business aggregates, markets and stores Occidental and third-party volumes. Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. The marketing business results can experience significant volatility depending on commodity prices and the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. In 2021, Permian to Gulf Coast transportation capacity increased as new third-party pipelines were completed. This, along with reduction in Permian Basin production, reduced the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. The Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads have decreased from an average of $1.43 per barrel in 2020 to $0.48 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2021. A $0.25 change in the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads impacts total year operating cash flows by approximately $65 million. Gas gathering, processing and transportation results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment’s plants, as well as the margins obtained on related services from investments in which Occidental has an equity interest. The 2021 increases in NGL prices and sulfur prices positively impacted the gas processing business.BUSINESS REVIEWMARKETINGThe marketing group markets substantially all of Occidental’s oil, NGL and natural gas production and optimizes its transportation and storage capacity. Occidental’s third-party marketing activities focus on purchasing oil, NGL and gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage assets. These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets. In 2021, compared to the prior year, marketing results were favorable due to the rising crude oil price environment and its impact on export sales.DELIVERY AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITMENTSOccidental has made long-term commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, NGL and natural gas. The total amount contracted to be delivered is approximately 92 MMbbl of oil through 2025, 731 MMbbl of NGL through 2029 and 764 Bcf of gas through 2029. The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product.Occidental has pipeline take-or-pay capacity of approximately 800 thousand barrels per day (Mbbl/d) to the Gulf Coast, leased storage capacity of approximately 10 MMbbl and capacity at the Ingleside Crude terminal of approximately 525 Mbbl/d.PIPELINEOccidental’s pipeline business mainly consists of its 24.5% ownership interest in DEL. DEL owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline (Dolphin Pipeline), which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman. The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf/d and currently transports approximately 2.0 Bcf/d and up to 2.2 Bcf/d in the summer months.GAS PROCESSING, GATHERING AND CO2Occidental processes its and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGL and other gas byproducts, including CO2 and delivers dry gas to pipelines. Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGL.As of December 31, 2021, Occidental owned all of the 2.2% non-voting general partner interest and 49.7% of the limited partner units in WES. On a combined basis, with its 2% non-voting limited partner interest in Western Midstream Operating, LP (WES Operating), Occidental's total effective economic interest in WES and its subsidiaries was 51.8%. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 35MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS10-K for more information regarding Occidental’s equity method investment in WES. WES owns gathering systems, plants and pipelines and earns revenue from fee-based and service-based contracts with Occidental and third parties.Occidental’s 40% participating interest in Al Hosn Gas also includes sour gas processing facilities that are designed to process 1.28 Bcf/d of natural gas and separate it into salable gas, condensate, NGL and sulfur. In 2021, the project produced 640 MMcf/d of natural gas, 100 Mbbl/d of NGL and condensate, and 11,700 tons/d of sulfur, of which Occidental’s net share was 256 MMcf/d of natural gas, 40 Mbbl/d of NGL and condensate and 4,700 tons/d of sulfur.In 2021, compared to the prior year, gas processing, gathering and CO2 results increased primarily due to higher sulfur and NGL prices.POWER GENERATION FACILITIESEarnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties.LOW-CARBON VENTURESOLCV was formed to execute on Occidental’s vision to reduce global emissions and provide a more sustainable future through the development of low-carbon energy and products. OLCV capitalizes on Occidental’s extensive experience in utilizing CO2 in its development of CCUS projects and providing services to third parties to facilitate the implementation of their CCUS projects. Moreover, OLCV is fostering new technologies, including DAC and low-carbon power sources, and business models with the potential to position Occidental as a leader in the production of low-carbon oil and products.Occidental has developed standards and protocols recognized by the EPA for monitoring, reporting and verifying the amount, safety and permanence of CO2 stored through secure geologic sequestration. Occidental holds the nation’s first two EPA-approved monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) plans for geologic sequestration through EOR production and obtained a third MRV plan in 2021. OLCV is currently conducting front-end engineering design work and feasibility studies on a number of projects to capture and sequester CO2, either from the atmosphere or from industrial point sources. In 2022, OLCV plans to invest approximately $300 million to pursue various projects.The profitability of sequestration projects is dependent upon the costs of developing, building and operating sequestration infrastructure, demand for sequestration services from emitters and the availability of certain tax attributes and credits generated from the capture and storage of CO2.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKMidstream and marketing segment results can experience volatility depending on the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads, commodity price changes and demand impacting export sales. To a lesser extent, declines in commodity prices, including NGL and sulfur prices, reduce the results for the gas processing business.At the end of 2021, the U.S. experienced economy-wide cost increases, which could increase the cost of sequestration projects. Occidental saw increased interest from third parties in providing sequestration services during the year. Additionally, grants, credits and other tax-advantaged low-carbon attributes continue to be actively discussed at both state and federal levels. These trends are expected to continue, which Occidental believes will enhance the economics of sequestration projects. 36 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITYSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSegment earnings exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations, but include gains and losses from divestitures of segment assets and income from the segments’ equity investments.

Domestic oil and gas results, excluding significant items affecting comparability, increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher realized oil, NGL and natural gas prices, partially offset by higher DD&A rates and overall lower oil volumes, primarily in the Permian Basin and DJ Basin. International oil and gas results, excluding significant items affecting comparability, increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher oil prices partially offset by lower oil volumes.ProductionThe following table sets forth the production volumes of oil, NGL and natural gas per day from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and includes a year-over-year change calculation: Production per Day, Ongoing Operations (Mboe/d)2021Year over Year Change2020Year over Year Change2019United States Permian487 (15)%575 13 %509 Rockies & Other Domestic302 (9)%332 126 %147 Gulf of Mexico144 11 %130 124 %58 Total933 (10)%1,037 45 %714 InternationalAlgeria & Other International44 (2)%45 88 %24 Al Hosn Gas76 (3)%78 (5)%82 Dolphin40 (9)%44 5 %42 Oman74 (13)%85 (4)%89 Total234 (7)%252 6 %237 Total Production from Ongoing Operations1,167 (9)%1,289 36 %951 Operations exited (a)16 (72)%58 (26)%78 Total Production (Mboe/d) (b)1,183 (12)%1,347 31 %1,029 (a)Operations exited include the Ghana assets (sold in October 2021), the Colombia onshore assets (sold in December 2020) and the Qatar Idd El Shargi Fields (exited in 2019).(b)Natural gas volumes have been converted to Boe based on energy content of six Mcf of gas to one barrel of oil. Boe equivalent does not necessarily result in price equivalency. Please refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (unaudited) section of this Form 10-K for additional information on oil and gas production and sales.OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 39MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISAverage daily production volumes from ongoing operations decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to maintaining capital expenditures at a level to sustain production at the rate Occidental exited 2020. Lease Operating ExpenseThe following table sets forth the average lease operating expense per Boe from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021:202120202019Average lease operating expense per Boe$7.58 $6.38 $9.07 Average lease operating expense per Boe increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily as a result of higher maintenance, support and workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico, including additional costs associated with platforms reaching the end of their useful life, as well as higher energy and purchase injectant costs in the Permian, partially offset by continued operational efficiencies which decreased down hole maintenance and workover and support costs in the Permian.CHEMICAL SEGMENTmillions202120202019Segment Sales$5,246 $3,733 $4,102 Segment Results$1,544 $664 $799 Chemical segment results increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to improved demand due to improved U.S. economic growth and higher prices across most product lines, including caustic soda and PVC, partially offset by higher raw material costs, primarily ethylene and energy.MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENTmillions202120202019Segment Sales$2,863 $1,768 $4,132 Segment Results (a)$257 $(4,175)$241 Items affecting comparabilityAsset sales gains (losses) and others, net (b)$124 $(46)$114 Goodwill impairments and other charges (c)$(21)$(4,194)$(1,002)Derivative gains (losses), net (d)$(252)$97 $(184)(a)Results included significant items affecting comparability discussed in the footnotes below.(b)The 2021 amount included a $102 million gain from the sale of 11.5 million limited partner units in WES. The 2020 amount represented a loss on the exchange of WES common units to retire a $260 million note. The 2019 amount represented a $114 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Plains GP Holdings, L.P. (together, Plains). (c)The 2020 amount included a $2.7 billion other-than-temporary impairment of the equity investment in WES and $1.4 billion of impairments related to the write-off of goodwill and a loss from an equity investment related to WES’ write-off of its goodwill. The 2019 amount included a $1 billion charge as a result of recording Occidental’s investment in WES at fair value as of December 31, 2019 upon the loss of control.(d)The 2019 amount represented a $30 million mark-to-market gain on an interest rate swap for WES and other derivative mark-to-market activity.Midstream and marketing segment results, excluding items affecting comparability, increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to improved marketing results from higher crude oil prices and higher sulfur prices at Al Hosn Gas. 40 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCORPORATESignificant corporate items include the following:millions202120202019Items Affecting ComparabilityAnadarko acquisition-related costs (a)$(153)$(339)$(1,647)Bridge loan financing fees (a)$— $— $(122)Acquisition-related pension & termination benefits (a)$— $114 $37 Interest rate swap gains (losses), net (b)$122 $(428)$122 Early debt extinguishment expenses and other$(118)$— $(22)Warrants gains, net (b)$— $5 $81 (a)See Note 5 - Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.(b)See Note 8 - Derivatives in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. INCOME TAXES Total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance, were $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences. The total deferred tax liabilities were $10.5 billion and $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in net deferred tax liability in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the impact of lower capital spending and domestic asset impairments for which Occidental does not receive an immediate tax benefit, partially offset by the utilization of net operating losses and other tax attributes.LEGAL ENTITY REORGANIZATIONIn order to align Occidental’s legal entity structure with the nature of its business activities after completing the acquisition of Anadarko and subsequent large scale post-Acquisition divestiture program, management has undertaken a legal entity reorganization that is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.As a result of this legal entity reorganization, management will make an adjustment to the tax basis in a portion of its operating assets, thus reducing Occidental’s deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2022, Occidental will record a one-time non-cash tax benefit that is currently estimated not to exceed $2.6 billion, in connection with this reorganization. The timing of any reduction in Occidental’s future cash taxes as a result of this legal entity reorganization will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing commodity prices, capital activity level and production mix. Occidental will complete its review of its tax basis calculations, fair value assessments and other information and will finalize the adjustment to its deferred tax liabilities during the first quarter of 2022. WORLDWIDE EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:millions202120202019SEGMENT RESULTS Oil and gas$4,145 $(9,632)$2,520 Chemical1,544 664 799 Midstream and marketing257 (4,175)241 Unallocated corporate items(2,241)(2,562)(3,206)Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes$3,705 $(15,705)$354 Income tax benefit (expense) Federal and state(247)2,607 34 Foreign(668)(435)(895)Total income tax benefit (expense)(915)2,172 (861)Income (loss) from continuing operations$2,790 $(13,533)$(507)Worldwide effective tax rate25 %14 %243 %OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 41MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISIn 2021, Occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 25%, which was higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to higher tax rates in the foreign jurisdictions in which Occidental operates, partially offset by the tax impact of business credits, state tax revaluations and other domestic tax benefits.In 2020, Occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 14%, which was largely a result of the impairment of the WES goodwill and certain international assets for which Occidental received no tax benefit and higher-taxed international operations which generally caused Occidental’s tax rate to vary significantly from the U.S. corporate tax rate.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSREVENUE AND OTHER INCOME ITEMSmillions202120202019Net sales$25,956 $17,809 $20,911 Interest, dividends and other income$166 $118 $217 Gains (losses) on sale of assets, net$192 $(1,666)$622 NET SALESPrice and volume changes generally represent the majority of the change in the oil and gas and chemical segments sales. Midstream and marketing sales generally represent the margins earned by the marketing business at it strives to optimize the use of its transportation, storage and terminal commitments to provide access to domestic and international markets and, to a lesser extent, NGL and sulfur revenues from the gas processing business. The increase in net sales in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher realized commodity prices, which were partially offset by lower oil volumes. Chemical sales increased primarily due to higher prices and volumes across all product lines, specifically PVC, VCM and caustic due to increased domestic demand and record high pricing in global markets. Midstream and marketing sales improved due to the rising crude oil price environment and its impact on export sales and higher realized sulfur prices at Al Hosn Gas.GAINS (LOSSES) ON SALE OF ASSETS, NETThe 2021 gains on sales of assets, net, was primarily comprised of a gain from the sale of limited partner units of WES in the first quarter of 2021 as well as post-closing consideration earned on 2020 asset sales as a result of certain production and pricing targets being met. Losses on asset sales in 2020 included $820 million related to the sale of certain non-core, largely non-operated acreage in the Permian Basin, $440 million related to the sale of 4.5 million mineral acres and 1 million fee surface acres located in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, $353 million related to the sale of the Colombia onshore assets and a loss of $46 million related to an exchange of 27.9 million WES limited partner units to retire a $260 million note payable to WES.

TRANSPORTATION AND GATHERING EXPENSETransportation and gathering expense decreased in 2021 from the prior year, primarily as a result of lower domestic oil and gas production volumes.CHEMICAL AND MIDSTREAM COST OF SALESChemical and midstream cost of sales increased in 2021 from the prior year, primarily due to higher ethylene and energy costs in the chemical segment and higher energy costs in the midstream segment. PURCHASED COMMODITIESPurchased commodities increased in 2021 largely as a result of higher crude oil prices on third-party crude purchases related to the midstream and marketing segment. OTHER OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING EXPENSEOther operating and non-operating expense increased in 2021 from the prior year, primarily due to a net gain in 2020 related to the settlement, curtailment and special termination benefits on pension plans acquired in the Acquisition. DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATIONDepreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense increased in 2021 from the prior year, primarily due to higher DD&A rates primarily in the onshore U.S. domestic assets. As a result of Occidental's mid-year reserve review undertaken in the second quarter of 2021, DD&A rates for the second half of 2021 were lower compared to the first half of 2021 due to increased proved reserves primarily related to positive price revisions. Proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves were estimated during this mid-year review using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER CHARGESIn 2021, asset impairments and other charges of $304 million were mainly comprised of the impairment of undeveloped leases that either expired or were set to expire in the near-term where Occidental had no plans to pursue exploration activities. In 2020, asset impairments and other charges included pre-tax impairments of $4.5 billion primarily related to domestic onshore unproved acreage as well as $1.3 billion primarily related to other domestic onshore assets and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition there were $931 million of impairment and related charges associated with Occidental’s proved properties in Algeria to remeasure the Algeria oil and gas properties to their fair value. Also for the midstream and marketing segment, there were pre-tax impairment charges of $2.7 billion other-than-temporary impairment of the equity investment in WES and $1.2 billion of impairments related to the write-off of goodwill. In 2021, impairments included $276 million related to undeveloped leases that either expired or were set to expire in the near-term, where Occidental had no plans to pursue exploration activities.TAXES OTHER THAN ON INCOMETaxes other than on income in 2021 increased from the prior year, primarily due to higher production taxes, which are directly tied to higher commodity prices.OTHER ITEMSIncome (expense) millions202120202019Gains (losses) on interest rate swaps and warrants$122 $(423)$233 Income from equity investments$631 $370 $373 Income tax benefit (expense)$(915)$2,172 $(861)GAINS (LOSSES) ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND WARRANTS Gains on interest rate swaps in 2021 were due to an increase in the floating reference rate of interest rate swaps.INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTSIncome from equity investments in 2021 increased as a result of higher earnings from WES as income from equity earnings in 2020 included a loss of $240 million related to WES’s write-off of its goodwill. OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 43MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISINCOME TAX BENEFIT (EXPENSE)Income tax expense increased in 2021 from the prior year, as a result of higher pre-tax income, which was primarily related to higher commodity prices.LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NETDiscontinued operations, net, primarily included a $437 million after-tax loss contingency associated with Occidental’s former operations in Ecuador, see Note - 13 Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part ii Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. In addition, discontinued operations, net was associated with operations in Ghana which were sold in October 2021.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH ON HANDAs of December 31, 2021, Occidental had approximately $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. A substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the United States.SOURCES AND USES OF CASHIn the current commodity price environment, Occidental expects to fund its operational and capital requirements as well as return capital to its shareholders via an increase in common dividends and a reactivated share repurchase program with cash flows from operations. Sustained strength in commodity prices and the resultant cash flow generated will also allow Occidental to continue to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing debt and other financial obligations. Occidental currently expects its operational cash flows and cash on hand to be sufficient to meet its current debt maturities and other obligations for the next 12 months from the date of this filing. Should commodity prices return to their 2020 lows, Occidental’s $4.0 billion RCF, receivables securitization facility and access to capital markets are available to meet its ongoing capital needs, purchase obligations, near-term debt maturities and other liabilities and financial obligations, if required.Occidental’s 2022 capital budget is $3.9 billion to $4.3 billion, of which only a small percentage is allocated to non-cancellable commitments. As of December 31, 2021, Occidental had $101 million in current maturities of long-term debt through December 31, 2022, and an additional $465 million in long-term obligations due in 2023. The current maturities of long-term debt were paid in January 2022. As of December 31, 2021, Occidental had $268 million in non-cancelable lease payments due in 2022, and an additional $212 million in non-cancelable lease payments due in 2023. Dividends on common and preferred stock were $839 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.Occidental is party to various purchase agreements that are not accounted for as leases or otherwise accrued as liabilities as of December 31, 2021. These agreements consist primarily of obligations to secure terminal, pipeline and processing capacity, purchase services used in the normal course of business including transporting and disposing of produced water, purchase goods used in the production of finished goods including certain chemical raw materials and power and agreements relating to equipment maintenance and service. The amounts that will be paid for such outstanding off-balance sheet purchase obligations as of December 31, 2021 are $3.0 billion in 2022, $4.3 billion in 2023 and 2024, $2.6 billion in 2025 and 2026 and $2.6 billion in 2027 and thereafter.SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMOn February 10, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program with a maximum dollar limit of $3 billion and no set term limits, which supersedes the previously authorized share repurchase program. 44 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe following table summarizes and cross-references Occidental’s contractual obligations and indicates on- and off-balance sheet obligations as of December 31, 2021.

Long-term purchase contracts were discounted at a 4.99% discount rate. DEBT ACTIVITYOccidental recently completed its large scale asset divestiture program and used the net proceeds from asset sales and free cash flow to repay near and medium-term debt maturities. During 2021, through repayments and cash tenders Occidental reduced its face value of borrowings by $6.7 billion from $35.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, to $28.5 billion as of December 31, 2021.In January 2022, Occidental used cash on hand to repay of $101 million in outstanding 2.600% senior notes due April 2022, which were called in December 2021. Subsequent to the repayment of this note, there are no remaining 2022 debt maturities.In the fourth quarter of 2021, Occidental completed a cash tender offer for outstanding senior notes with a face value of $1.5 billion and maturities ranging from 2024 to 2049 and called and repaid $627 million of senior notes due 2022. In the third quarter of 2021, Occidental completed a cash tender for outstanding senior notes with a face value of $3.0 billion and maturities ranging from 2022 through 2026, paid $224 million of senior notes upon maturity and fully retired $1.1 billion of floating interest rate notes due August 2022. In the first quarter of 2021, Occidental repaid $174 million of debt upon maturity. In December 2021, Occidental entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement on its existing $5.0 billion RCF in which the total commitment was decreased to $4.0 billion, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) benchmark was changed to SOFR, an environmental key performance indicator was added with regard to scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from worldwide operated assets, making this a sustainability-linked loan, and the facility maturity date was extended to June 30, 2025. As of December 31, 2021, under the most restrictive covenants of its financing agreements, Occidental had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental common stock.See Note 6 - Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information related to Occidental’s debt issuance and repayments.GUARANTEESOccidental has entered into various guarantees, indemnities and commitments provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that Occidental or its consolidated subsidiaries or affiliates will meet their various obligations.OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 45MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCASH FLOW ANALYSISCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIESmillions202120202019Operating cash flow from continuing operations$10,253 $3,842 $7,336 Operating cash flow from discontinued operations, net of taxes181 113 39 Net cash provided by operating activities$10,434 $3,955 $7,375 Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher commodity prices, especially for oil, as average WTI and Brent prices increased by 72% and 64%, respectively. The chemical segment also generated substantial operating cash flows largely due to higher demand for most chemical products including caustic soda and PVC and higher pricing relative to 2020. The overall increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by an increase in working capital related to receivables, which increased largely as a result of higher commodity prices.

In 2020, Occidental reduced capital spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and targeted its capital spend in 2021 to maintain Q4 production and other maintenance capital for operating segments. Additionally, Occidental completed its major divestiture plans, reducing proceeds from asset sales year over year. See Note 5 - Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a listing of assets and equity investments sold in 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, Occidental received a $450 million return of investment from DEL, which is being presented in other investing activities, net, and acquired an additional working interests in certain assets in the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico for approximately $360 million.

Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in proceedings under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state, local and international environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and injunctive relief. Usually Occidental or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for matters, other than for environmental remediation and the arbitration award disclosed below, that satisfy this criteria as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, were not material to Occidental’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.In 2016, Occidental received payments from the Republic of Ecuador of approximately $1.0 billion pursuant to a November 2015 arbitration award for Ecuador’s 2006 expropriation of Occidental’s Participation Contract for Block 15. The awarded amount represented a recovery of 60% of the value of Block 15. In 2017, Andes Petroleum Ecuador Ltd. (Andes) filed a demand for arbitration, claiming it is entitled to a 40% share of the judgment amount obtained by Occidental. Occidental contends that Andes is not entitled to any of the amounts paid under the 2015 arbitration award because Occidental’s recovery was limited to Occidental’s own 60% economic interest in the block. On March 26, 2021, the arbitration tribunal issued an award in favor of Andes and against Occidental Exploration and Production Company (OEPC) in the amount of $391 million plus interest. In June 2021, OEPC filed a motion to vacate the award due to concerns regarding the validity of the award. In addition, OEPC has made a demand for significant additional claims not addressed by the arbitration tribunal that OEPC has against Andes relating to Andes' 40% share of costs, liabilities, losses and expenses due under the farmout agreement and joint operating agreement to which Andes and OEPC are parties. In December 2021, the U.S. District Court Southern District of New York confirmed the arbitration award, plus prejudgment interest, in the aggregate amount of $558 million. OEPC has appealed the judgement.In August 2019, Sanchez Energy Corporation and certain of its affiliates (Sanchez) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Sanchez is a party to agreements with Anadarko as a result of its 2017 purchase of Anadarko's Eagle Ford Shale assets. Sanchez attempted to reject some of the agreements related to the purchase of Anadarko’s Eagle Ford Shale assets (the Bankruptcy Litigation). If Sanchez was permitted to reject certain of those agreements, then Anadarko may owe deficiency payments to various third parties. In December 2021, Occidental and certain of its affiliates entered into an agreement to resolve the Bankruptcy Litigation. Occidental recorded a contingency reserve as of September 30, 2021, associated with the settlement.If unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur, future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected. Occidental’s estimates are based on information known about the legal matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Occidental reassesses the probability and estimability of contingent losses as new information becomes available.TAX MATTERSDuring the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local and international tax jurisdictions. Tax years through 2017 for U.S. federal income tax purposes have been audited by the IRS pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program and subsequent taxable years are currently under review. Tax years through 2012 have been audited for state income tax purposes. Significant audit matters in international jurisdictions have been resolved through 2010. During the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. For Anadarko, its taxable years through 2014 and tax year 2016 for U.S. federal tax purposes have been audited by the IRS. Tax years through 2008 have been audited for state income tax purposes. There is one outstanding significant tax matter in an international jurisdiction related to a discontinued operation. As stated above, during the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and matters of law. Other than the matter discussed below, Occidental believes that the resolution of these outstanding tax matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.Anadarko received an $881 million tentative refund in 2016 related to its $5.2 billion Tronox Adversary Proceeding settlement payment in 2015. In September 2018, Anadarko received a statutory notice of deficiency from the IRS disallowing the net operating loss carryback and rejecting Anadarko’s refund claim. As a result, Anadarko filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court to dispute the disallowances in November 2018. The case was in the IRS appeals process until the second OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 47MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISquarter of 2020; however, it has since been returned to the U.S. Tax Court, where a trial date has been set for July 2022 and Occidental expects to continue pursuing resolution.In accordance with ASC 740’s guidance on the accounting for uncertain tax positions, Occidental has recorded no tax benefit on the tentative cash tax refund of $881 million. As a result, should Occidental not ultimately prevail on the issue, there would be no additional tax expense recorded relative to this position for financial statement purposes other than future interest. However, in that event, Occidental would be required to repay approximately $1 billion in federal taxes, $27 million in state taxes and accrued interest of $314 million. A liability for this amount plus interest is included in deferred credits and other liabilities-other.INDEMNITIES TO THIRD PARTIESOccidental, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2021, Occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURESOccidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and international laws and regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality. The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and international laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. Occidental or certain of its subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party sites. Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal, treatment or disposal; or operation and maintenance of remedial systems. The environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATIONAs of December 31, 2021, Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at 165 sites. The following table presents Occidental’s current and non-current environmental remediation liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($155 million in 2021 and $123 million in 2020) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities - environmental remediation liabilities ($0.9 billion in 2021 and $1.0 billion in 2020).Occidental’s environmental remediation sites are grouped into four categories: National Priorities List (NPL) sites listed or proposed for listing by the EPA on the CERCLA NPL and three categories of non-NPL sites — third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-operated Occidental sites.20212020millions, except number of sitesNumber of SitesRemediation BalanceNumber of SitesRemediation BalanceNPL sites30 $427 35 $447 Third-party sites69 273 69 293 Occidental-operated sites15 122 17 144 Closed or non-operated Occidental sites51 277 49 267 Total165 $1,099 170 $1,151 As of December 31, 2021, Occidental’s environmental liabilities exceeded $10 million each at 20 of the 165 sites described above and 96 of the sites had liabilities from $0 to $1 million each. As of December 31, 2021, two sites — the Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus)-indemnified Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and a landfill in Western New York — accounted for 96% of its liabilities associated with NPL sites. 14 of the 30 NPL sites are indemnified by Maxus.Five of the 69 third-party sites — a Maxus-indemnified chrome site in New Jersey, a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee, a former oil field and a landfill in California and an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental reimburses the current owner for certain remediation activities — accounted for 75% of Occidental’s liabilities associated with these sites. Nine of the 69 third-party sites are indemnified by Maxus.Four sites — oil and gas operations in Colorado and chemical plants in Kansas, Louisiana and Texas — accounted for 69% of the liabilities associated with the Occidental-operated sites. Ten other sites — a landfill in Western New York, a 48 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISformer refinery in Oklahoma, former chemical plants in California, Delaware, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Tennessee and Washington, and a closed coal mine in Pennsylvania — accounted for 75% of the liabilities associated with closed or non-operated Occidental sites.Environmental remediation liabilities vary over time depending on factors such as acquisitions or divestitures, identification of additional sites and remedy selection and implementation. Occidental recorded environmental remediation expenses of $28 million, $36 million and $112 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Environmental remediation expenses primarily relate to changes to existing conditions from past operations. Based on current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately 40% of the year-end remediation balance over the next three to four years with the remainder over the subsequent 10 or more years. Occidental believes its range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond those amounts currently recorded for environmental remediation for all of its environmental sites could be up to $1.3 billion.MAXUS ENVIRONMENTAL SITESWhen Occidental acquired Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986, Maxus, a subsidiary of YPF S.A., agreed to indemnify Occidental for a number of environmental sites, including the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site (Site) along a portion of the Passaic River. On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware. Prior to filing for bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with clean-up and other costs associated with the sites subject to the indemnity, including the Site.In March 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) specifying remedial actions required for the lower 8.3 miles of the Lower Passaic River. The ROD does not address any potential remedial action for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River or Newark Bay. During the third quarter of 2016, and following Maxus’s bankruptcy filing, Occidental and the EPA entered into an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD with an estimated cost of $165 million. The EPA announced that it will pursue similar agreements with other potentially responsible parties.Occidental has accrued a reserve relating to its estimated allocable share of the costs to perform the design and remediation called for in the AOC and the ROD, as well as for certain other Maxus-indemnified sites. Occidental's accrued estimated environmental reserve does not consider any recoveries for indemnified costs. Occidental’s ultimate share of this liability may be higher or lower than the reserved amount, and is subject to final design plans and the resolution of Occidental's allocable share with other potentially responsible parties. Occidental continues to evaluate the costs to be incurred to comply with the AOC and the ROD and to perform remediation at other Maxus-indemnified sites in light of the Maxus bankruptcy and the share of ultimate liability of other potentially responsible parties. In June 2018, Occidental filed a complaint under CERCLA in Federal District Court in the State of New Jersey against numerous potentially responsible parties for reimbursement of amounts incurred or to be incurred to comply with the AOC and the ROD, or to perform other remediation activities at the Site.In September 2021, the EPA issued a ROD with an estimated cost of $441 million for an interim remedy plan for the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River. At this time, Occidental’s role or responsibilities under this ROD, and those of other potentially responsible parties, have not been determined with the EPA. Discussions between Occidental and the EPA are ongoing about this ROD. In June 2017, the court overseeing the Maxus bankruptcy approved a Plan of Liquidation (Plan) to liquidate Maxus and create a trust to pursue claims against current and former parents YPF and each of its respective subsidiaries and affiliates (YPF) and Repsol, S.A. and each of its respective subsidiaries and affiliates (Repsol), as well as others to satisfy claims by Occidental and other creditors for past and future cleanup and other costs. In July 2017, the court-approved Plan became final and the trust became effective. The trust is pursuing claims against YPF, Repsol and others and is expected to distribute assets to Maxus' creditors in accordance with the trust agreement and Plan. In June 2018, the trust filed its complaint against YPF and Repsol in Delaware bankruptcy court asserting claims based upon, among other things, fraudulent transfer and alter ego. During 2019, the bankruptcy court denied Repsol's and YPF's motions to dismiss the complaint as well as their motions to move the case away from the bankruptcy court. Discovery remains ongoing.OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 49MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISENVIRONMENTAL COSTSOccidental’s environmental costs, some of which include estimates, are presented below for each segment for each of the years ended December 31:millions202120202019Operating Expenses Oil and gas$267 $176 $174 Chemical88 73 80 Midstream and marketing6 4 12 Total$361 $253 $266 Capital ExpendituresOil and gas$87 $74 $109 Chemical66 40 34 Midstream and marketing1 1 4 Total$154 $115 $147 Remediation ExpensesCorporate$28 $36 $112 Operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis.

Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts. The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management’s judgment.OIL AND GAS PROPERTIESThe carrying value of Occidental’s property, plant and equipment (PP&E) represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any asset retirement obligations (AROs) and capitalized interest, net of DD&A and any impairment charges. For assets acquired in a business combination, PP&E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date. AROs and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. For exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and operating viability of the project. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether Occidental is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological and geophysical costs as incurred for exploration activities.Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method. It amortizes leasehold acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves. As a result of Occidental's mid-year reserve review undertaken in the second quarter of 2021, DD&A rates for the second half of 2021 were lower compared to the first half of 2021 due to increased proved reserves primarily related to positive price revisions. Proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves were estimated during this mid-year review using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements.Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Several factors could change Occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves. For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit. Occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Generally, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices. In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental’s control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves. Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded. Changes in the political and regulatory climate could lead to decreases in proved reserves as development horizons may be extended into the future. Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable. If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management’s plans or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment. Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 51MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISperiod. Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows unless observable and comparable transactions are available. The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants. The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time. These assumptions include estimates of future production, product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas proved and unproved reserves and estimates of future operating and development costs. It is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in impairments.For impairment testing, unless prices are contractually fixed, Occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows. Future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves. Market prices for oil, NGL and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Changes in global supply and demand, transportation capacity, currency exchange rates, applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts. Future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly. Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $14.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, and $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2020. The unproved amounts are not subject to DD&A until they are classified as proved properties. Individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms, success rates and other factors to provide for full amortization upon lease expiration or abandonment. Significant unproved properties, primarily as a result of the Acquisition, are assessed individually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recovered a valuation allowance is provided if an impairment is indicated. Occidental periodically reviews significant unproved properties for impairments; numerous factors are considered, including but not limited to, availability of funds for future exploration and development activities, current exploration and development plans, favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property, geologists’ evaluation of the property, the current and projected political and regulatory climate, contractual conditions and the remaining lease term for the properties. If an impairment is indicated, Occidental will first determine whether a comparable transaction for similar properties or implied acreage valuation derived from domestic onshore market participants is available and will adjust the carrying amount of the unproved property to its fair value using the market approach. In situations where the market approach is not observable and unproved reserves are available, undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on managements’ risk adjusted estimates of unproved reserves, future commodity prices and future costs to produce the reserves. If undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. Occidental utilizes the same assumptions and methodology discussed above for cash flows associated with proved properties. PROVED RESERVESOccidental estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC and Financial Accounting Standards Board. This definition includes oil, NGL and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Occidental’s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments.The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental’s oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD&A rate. For example, a 5% increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD&A rate by approximately $0.65/Bbl, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $275 million annually at current production rates. 52 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISFAIR VALUESOccidental estimates fair-value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets and initial measurements of AROs.Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value.Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs. When estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, Occidental must apply various assumptions.FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIESOccidental utilizes published prices or counterparty statements for valuing the majority of its financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:■Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date. These derivatives are classified as using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities (Level 1).■Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, international exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities (Level 2) and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.■Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as using unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the valuation hierarchy.■Occidental values debt using market-observable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets. For debt instruments that are not traded, the fair value is determined by interpolating the value based on debt with similar terms and credit risk.NON-FINANCIAL ASSETSOccidental uses market-observable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued. When Occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions. The cost approach is based on management’s best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management’s best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment. The results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates and other factors, most of which are often outside of management’s control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant’s view of long-term prices, costs and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in Occidental’s business plans and investment decisions.ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURESEnvironmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Occidental records environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs that relate to existing conditions from past operations when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements. Occidental bases its environmental remediation liabilities on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective. Occidental periodically reviews its environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available. Occidental generally records reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 53MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIShighly probable.Many factors could affect Occidental’s future remediation costs and result in adjustments to its environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses. The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and control contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify Occidental’s proposed remedial plan; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs. In these circumstances, Occidental evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate when estimating Occidental’s ultimate share of liability. Occidental records its environmental remediation liabilities at its expected net cost of remedial activities and, based on these factors, believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.In addition to the costs of investigations and cleanup measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at CERCLA NPL sites, Occidental’s environmental remediation liabilities include management’s estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems. If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and adjusts its environmental remediation liabilities accordingly.If Occidental were to adjust the balance of its environmental remediation liabilities based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings. For example, if the balance were reduced by 10%, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $110 million. If the balance were increased by 10%, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $110 million.INCOME TAXESOccidental files various U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns. The impact of changes in tax regulations are reflected when enacted. In general, deferred federal, state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Occidental routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. If Occidental concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Occidental recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense (benefit). See Note 10 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.LOSS CONTINGENCIESOccidental is involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits. Occidental accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Management’s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management’s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors. See Note 13 - Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.54 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATAPortions of this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, and they include, but are not limited to: any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items or future financial position or sources of financing; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations or business strategy; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Words such as “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “aim,” “goal,” “target,” “objective,” ""commit,"" ""advance,"" “likely” or similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes are generally indicative of forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update, modify or withdraw any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Although Occidental believes that the expectations reflected in any of its forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially. In addition, historical, current and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Factors that could cause results to differ from those projected or assumed in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic; Occidental’s indebtedness and other payment obligations, including the need to generate sufficient cash flows to fund operations; Occidental’s ability to successfully monetize select assets and repay or refinance debt and the impact of changes in Occidental’s credit ratings; assumptions about energy markets; global and local commodity and commodity-futures pricing fluctuations; supply and demand considerations for, and the prices of, Occidental’s products and services; actions by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries; results from operations and competitive conditions; future impairments of our proved and unproved oil and gas properties or equity investments, or write-downs of productive assets, causing charges to earnings; unexpected changes in costs; availability of capital resources, levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations; the regulatory approval environment, including Occidental's ability to timely obtain or maintain permits or other governmental approvals, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects; Occidental's ability to successfully complete, or any material delay of, field developments, expansion projects, capital expenditures, efficiency projects, acquisitions or dispositions; risks associated with acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures, such as difficulties integrating businesses, uncertainty associated with financial projections, projected synergies, restructuring, increased costs and adverse tax consequences; uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested properties and businesses; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves; lower-than-expected production from development projects or acquisitions; Occidental’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes and improve Occidental’s competitiveness; exploration, drilling and other operational risks; disruptions to, capacity constraints in, or other limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver Occidental’s oil and natural gas and other processing and transportation considerations; general economic conditions, including slowdowns, domestically or internationally, and volatility in the securities, capital or credit markets; inflation; governmental actions, war and political conditions and events; legislative or regulatory changes, including changes relating to hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operations, retroactive royalty or production tax regimes, deep-water and onshore drilling and permitting regulations and environmental regulation (including regulations related to climate change); environmental risks and liability under federal, regional, state, provincial, tribal, local and international environmental laws and regulations (including remedial actions); Occidental's ability to recognize intended benefits from its business strategies and initiatives, such as OLCV or announced GHG emissions reduction targets or net-zero goals; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; disruption or interruption of production or manufacturing or facility damage due to accidents, chemical releases, labor unrest, weather, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks or insurgent activity; the creditworthiness and performance of Occidental's counterparties, including financial institutions, operating partners and other parties; failure of risk management; Occidental’s ability to retain and hire key personnel; supply, transportation, and labor constraints; reorganization or restructuring of Occidental’s operations; changes in state, federal or international tax rates; and actions by third parties that are beyond Occidental's control.Additional information concerning these and other factors that may cause Occidental’s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations can be found in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as in Occidental’s other filings with the SEC, including Occidental’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 55QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKGENERALOccidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices. Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental’s budgeted 2022 pre-tax annual income by approximately $200 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and approximately $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.10 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental’s budgeted 2022 pre-tax income of approximately $40 million. These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental’s results to prices also will change. Marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil, natural gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities. A $0.25 change in the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads impacts budgeted 2022 operating cash flows by approximately $65 million.Occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices. A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively. A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $30 million. Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins.Occidental uses forwards derivative instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations for oil and natural gas and swaps to manage interest rate risks.RISK MANAGEMENTOccidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies. The controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check. Members of the risk management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer. Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, reporting to senior management on various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.FAIR VALUE OF MARKETING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTSOccidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value. Fair values for these contracts are derived from Level 1 and Level 2 sources. The fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant. The following table shows the fair value of Occidental’s derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:Maturity Periods Source of Fair Value Assets (Liabilities)millions20222023 and 20242025 and 20262027 and thereafterTotalPrices actively quoted$(91)$— $— $— $(91)Prices provided by other external sources(23)— — — (23)Total$(114)$— $— $— $(114)QUANTITATIVE INFORMATIONOccidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities. This measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95% level of confidence. Additionally, Occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice. As a result of these controls, Occidental believes that the market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance.56 OXY 2021 FORM 10-KQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESINTEREST RATE RISK GENERALOccidental pays fixed interest rates and receives a floating interest rate indexed to three-month LIBOR on its interest rate swaps. The remaining swaps have mandatory termination dates in September 2022 and 2023 with notional amounts of $275 million and $450 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, Occidental had a net liability of approximately $428 million based on the fair value of the swaps of negative $751 million netted against $323 million in posted cash collateral. A 25-basis point decrease in implied LIBOR rates over the term of the swaps would result in an additional liability of approximately $88 million on these swaps.As of December 31, 2021, Occidental had variable rate debt with a notional value of $68 million outstanding. A 25-basis point increase in LIBOR interest rates would increase gross interest expense approximately $1.7 million per year.As of December 31, 2021, Occidental had fixed rate debt with a fair value of $31.1 billion outstanding. A 25-basis point change in Treasury rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt approximately $629 million.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Occidental’s international operations have limited currency risk. Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes. A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars. Additionally, all of Occidental’s consolidated international oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency. The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income. CREDIT RISK The majority of Occidental’s counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and any inability of these customers to meet their settlement commitments. Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate. Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. Occidental also enters into futures contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk, if any.Certain OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features, primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of collateral that each party would need to post. The fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-contingent features, that were net liabilities as of December 31, 2021 was $107 million (net of $323 million collateral) and $104 million (net of $374 million collateral) as of December 31, 2020. Credit-risk-contingent features are primarily related to interest rate swaps.As of December 31, 2021, the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties. Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses as of December 31, 2021, was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.OXY 2021 FORM 10-K 57FINANCIAL STATEMENTSINDEX",2023-12-30 21:20:33.093951

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8 and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Part 1, Item 1A. The following sections include a discussion of results for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 as well as certain 2020 results. The comparative results for fiscal 2021 with fiscal 2020 generally have not been included in this Form 10-K, but may be found in “Part II - Item 7.

In 2022, as compared to 2021, the average annual price per barrel of WTI crude increased to $94.23 from $67.91 and the average annual Brent price per barrel increased to $98.83 from $70.78. The return of oil demand to its pre-pandemic levels, the ongoing global impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the limited increase in supply in 2022 have resulted in an increase in benchmark oil prices year-over-year. Occidental does not operate or own assets in either Russia or Ukraine. It is expected that the price of oil will be volatile for the foreseeable future given the current geopolitical risks, the ongoing global impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, and uncertainty around the global economy, oil demand in China as it emerges from its zero-COVID policy, production levels in OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries and further releases from or additions to the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve.Occidental works to manage inflation impacts by capitalizing on operational efficiencies, locking in pricing on longer term contracts and working closely with vendors to secure the supply of critical materials. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of Occidental's outstanding debt is fixed rate.STRATEGYOccidental is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition with its portfolio of oil and gas, chemicals and midstream and marketing assets and its ongoing development of carbon management and storage solutions and GHG emissions reduction efforts. Occidental conducts its operations with a priority on HSE, sustainability and social responsibility. Occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of:■Returning capital to shareholders, while redeeming a portion of preferred equity to continue improving Occidental’s financial position;■Enhancing its existing asset base with new investments in its core cash-generative oil and gas and chemical businesses as well as emerging low-carbon businesses with a focus on its net-zero pathway;■Advancing technologies and business solutions to help drive a sustainable low-carbon future; and■Further reducing long-term financial leverage.OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND CAPITAL EFFICIENCY Occidental's operational priorities for 2022 were to maximize operational efficiencies by investing $4.5 billion in high return assets to generate long-term sustainable free cash flow that will provide cash flow stability throughout the commodity cycle. Occidental set new operational records and efficiency benchmarks in the Permian, Rockies, Gulf of Mexico, Oman and UAE. OxyChem generated record earnings, beating its previous record set in 2021. With the increase in commodity prices and Occidental’s focus on its operational efficiencies, Occidental’s higher cash flow allowed it to reduce its leverage and advance its shareholder return framework. DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS Strong cash flow in 2022 allowed Occidental to continue its deleveraging efforts. In 2022, Occidental reduced its debt principal by more than $10.5 billion, leaving less than $18.0 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2022, and meeting its near-term debt reduction goal. As of December 31, 2022, Occidental had debt maturities of approximately $22 million in 2023, $1.1 billion in 2024 and $1.2 billion in 2025. The current maturity of $22 million was paid in January 2023, leaving no debt maturing in 2023. Occidental’s $673 million Zero Coupons can be put to Occidental in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons. The Zero Coupons can next be put to Occidental in October 2023, which, if put in whole, would require a payment of approximately $344 million at such date. Occidental currently has the intent and ability to meet this obligation, including, if necessary, using amounts available under the RCF should the put right be exercised. In the year ended December 31, 2022, Occidental settled all outstanding interest rate swaps with $255 million in cash and the application of $144 million collateral, leaving none outstanding as of December 31, 2022. DEBT RATINGS As of the date of this filing, Occidental’s long-term debt was rated BB+ by Fitch Ratings, Ba1 by Moody’s Investors Service and BB+ by Standard and Poor’s. Occidental believes the deleveraging performed to date may lead to future ratings upgrades, but cannot determine the timing of any potential ratings change. Any downgrade in credit ratings could impact Occidental's ability to access capital markets and increase its cost of capital. Occidental’s non-investment grade debt rating may require Occidental or its subsidiaries to provide financial assurance in the form of cash, letters of credit, surety bonds or other acceptable support under certain contractual arrangements. OXY 2022 FORM 10-K25MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSHAREHOLDER RETURN FRAMEWORKCapital is returned to shareholders through Occidental’s dividend and share repurchases. Occidental’s current dividend is $0.18 per share per quarter, or $0.72 on an annualized basis. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Occidental completed its $3.0 billion share repurchase program. In February 2023, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $3.0 billion of Occidental’s shares of common stock. Occidental anticipates that a higher percentage of excess free cash flow is expected to be allocated to shareholder returns in 2023 with the intention to begin redeeming the preferred stock. Occidental’s preferred stock includes a mandatory redemption provision that obligates Occidental to redeem the preferred at 110% of the par value on a dollar-for-dollar basis for every dollar distributed to common shareholders above $4.00 per share, on a trailing 12-month basis.SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP STRATEGYIn 2020, Occidental was the first U.S. oil and gas company to announce goals to achieve net-zero GHG emissions for its total emissions inventory including use of sold products. These goals include achieving net-zero GHG emissions (i) from its operations and energy use before 2040, with an ambition to do so before 2035, and (ii) from its total carbon inventory, including the use of its sold products, with an ambition to do so before 2050. In 2020, Occidental also set various interim targets, including 2025 carbon and methane intensity targets, and Occidental was the first U.S. oil and gas company to endorse the World Bank’s initiative for zero routine flaring by 2030. In 2022, the Board of Directors adopted Occidental’s updated HSE and Sustainability Principles, based on engagement with shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. The Principles reinforce the alignment among Occidental’s core values, goals and strategies, underpin our operational management system, and help to guide our workforce across our businesses.Occidental seeks to meet its sustainability and environmental goals through its development and commercialization of technologies that lower both GHG emissions from industrial processes and existing atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Occidental believes that carbon removal technologies, including DAC and CCUS, can, with incentives necessary for their development and deployment, provide essential CO2 reductions to assist the world’s transition to a less carbon-intensive economy. During 2022, Occidental undertook the following actions, among others, toward advancing its low-carbon strategy:■Achieved zero routine flaring of gas across its U.S. oil and gas operations, 8 years ahead of the World Bank’s 2030 target; ■Reduced estimated methane emissions by 33% from the 2020 baseline;■Began construction activities for DAC 1 in the Permian;■Acquired interests in approximately 265,000 net acres of pore space access along the U.S. Gulf Coast; and■Invested approximately $530 million in low-carbon businesses, technologies, and net-zero pathway advancements, including the aforementioned pore space.The future costs associated with emissions reduction, carbon removal and CCUS to meet its long-term net-zero GHG goals may be substantial and execution of its plans and net-zero pathway depends on securing third-party capital investments. Occidental is pursuing multiple pathways to fund these projects including project financing, long-term carbon removal or CCUS agreements, and identifying business opportunities with stakeholders in carbon-intensive industriesKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORSOccidental seeks to meet its strategic goals by continually measuring its success against key performance indicators that drive total stockholder return. In addition to efficient capital allocation and deployment discussed below in the section titled Oil and Gas Segment - Business Strategy, Occidental believes its most significant performance indicators are: OPERATIONAL■Total spend per barrel - In 2023, Occidental will continue to focus on controlling total costs from a per-barrel perspective. Total spend per barrel is the sum of capital spending, general and administrative expenses, other operating and non-operating expenses and oil and gas lease operating costs divided by global oil, NGL and natural gas sales volumes.■Daily production - Occidental seeks to maximize field operability and minimize production down-time. FINANCIAL■CROCE - CROCE is calculated as (i) the cash flows from operating activities, before changes in working capital, plus distributions from WES classified as investing cash flows, divided by (ii) the average of the opening and closing balances of total equity plus total debt.■Maintain and improve financial leverage to a level consistent with investment grade credit metrics. SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL■Specific interim emissions reduction and emissions intensity targets to advance our goal of net-zero operational and energy use emissions before 2040, with an ambition to achieve before 2035.■Milestones in specific carbon removal and CCUS projects that advance our net-zero total emissions inventory, including use of sold products, with an ambition to achieve before 2050.■Facilitate deployment of carbon removal, CCUS and other solutions to advance total carbon impact past 2050.26 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOIL AND GAS SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYOccidental’s oil and gas segment focuses on long-term value creation and leadership in sustainability, health, safety and the environment. In each core operating area, Occidental’s operations benefit from scale, technical expertise, decades of high-margin inventory, environmental and safety leadership and commercial and governmental collaboration. These attributes allow Occidental to bring additional production quickly to market, extend the life of older fields at lower costs and provide low-cost returns-driven growth opportunities with advanced technology. Occidental is one of the largest U.S. producers of liquids, which includes oil and NGL, allowing Occidental to maximize cash margins on a per barrel basis. The advantages that Occidental’s portfolio provides, coupled with its advanced subsurface characterization ability and the proven ability to execute, position Occidental for full-cycle success in the years ahead. The oil and gas segment maximizes efficiencies to deliver lower breakeven costs and generate excess free cash flow. The oil and gas segment strives to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize full-cycle value of the assets.The oil and gas business implements Occidental’s strategy primarily by:■Operating and developing areas where reserves are known to exist and optimizing capital intensity in core areas, primarily in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico, UAE, Oman and Algeria;■Maintaining a disciplined and prudent approach to capital expenditures with a focus on high-return, short and mid-cycle, cash-flow-generating opportunities and an emphasis on creating value and further enhancing Occidental’s existing positions;■Focusing Occidental’s subsurface characterization and technical activities on unconventional opportunities, primarily in the Permian Basin and Rockies;■Using secondary and tertiary recovery techniques in mature fields; and■Focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies and innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions.In 2022, oil and gas capital expenditures were approximately $3.8 billion and primarily focused on Occidental’s assets in the Permian Basin, DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and Oman. In 2023, Occidental plans to spend $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion to develop its oil and gas assets.OIL AND GAS PRICE ENVIRONMENTOil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance.

OXY 2022 FORM 10-K27MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDOMESTIC INTERESTSBUSINESS REVIEWOccidental conducts its domestic operations through land leases, subsurface mineral rights it owns, or a combination of both. Occidental’s domestic oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to 10 years, which is extended through the end of production once it commences. Occidental has leasehold and mineral interests in 9.5 million net acres, of which approximately 52% is leased, 47% is owned subsurface mineral rights and 1% is owned land with mineral rights. Approximately $3.6 billion to $4.0 billion of Occidental’s worldwide capital budget is expected to be allocated to its domestic operations in 2023.DOMESTIC ASSETS (a)1. Powder River Basin2. DJ Basin3. Permian Basin4. Gulf of Mexico(a)Map represents geographic outlines of the respective basins.The Permian Basin The Permian Basin extends throughout West Texas and Southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the United States, accounting for more than 43% of total United States oil production in 2022. Overall in 2022, Occidental’s production in the Permian Basin was approximately 513 Mboe/d. Occidental manages its Permian Basin operations through two businesses: Permian Resources, which includes unconventional opportunities, and Permian EOR, which utilizes secondary and tertiary recovery techniques. Occidental had a leading position in the Permian Basin, producing approximately 8% of the total oil in the basin in 2022. By exploiting the natural synergies between Permian Resources and Permian EOR, Occidental is able to deliver unique short- and long-term advantages, efficiencies and expertise across its Permian Basin operations. The Permian Resources unconventional business is focused on developing and producing unconventional reservoir targets using horizontal drilling technology. The development programs are designed to create long-term value from primary development by maximizing the recovery of oil, utilizing sustainable practices and providing strong financial returns. Occidental’s unconventional oil and gas operations in Permian Resources include approximately 1.4 million net acres. In 2022, our activities were focused in the core development areas with emphasis on maintaining the industry leading capital intensity through optimized surface infrastructure and customized well designs. Overall, in 2022, Permian Resources produced from approximately 3,300 gross wells and added 387 MMboe to Occidental’s proved reserves through development and extensions of proved areas. The Permian Basin’s concentration of large conventional reservoirs, strong CO2 flooding performance and the expansive CO2 transportation and processing infrastructure has resulted in decades of high-value enhanced oil production. With 34 active CO2 floods and over 50 years of experience, Occidental is the industry leader in Permian Basin CO2 flooding, which can increase ultimate oil recovery by 10% to 25%. Technology improvements, such as the recent trend toward vertical 28 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISexpansion of the CO2 flooded interval into residual oil zone targets, continue to yield more recovery from existing projects, and Permian EOR produced from approximately 13,000 gross wells in 2022.Significant opportunities also remain to gain additional recovery by expanding Occidental’s existing CO2 projects into new portions of reservoirs that have only been waterflooded. Permian EOR has a large inventory of future CO2 projects, which could be developed over the next 20 years or accelerated, depending on market conditions. In 2022, Occidental spent approximately $2.3 billion of capital in the Permian Basin, of which approximately 93% was spent on Permian Resources assets.Rockies and Other DomesticIn 2022, Occidental produced approximately 277 Mboe/d net in the Rockies and Other Domestic locations. Production in the DJ Basin is derived from 2,000 operated vertical wells and 2,400 operated horizontal wells primarily focused in the Niobrara and Codell formations. The DJ Basin, including the North DJ Basin, comprises approximately 800,000 total net acres and provides competitive economics, low breakeven costs and free cash flow generation through Occidental’s contiguous acreage position and royalty uplift.In the DJ Basin, horizontal drilling results in the field continue to be strong, with improved operational efficiencies in drilling and completions. In 2022, Occidental drilled 68 operated horizontal wells and completed 54 operated horizontal wells. Occidental is focusing on obtaining the necessary state, local and federal permits required to construct facilities and drill and complete wells in the DJ Basin. In January 2021, the COGCC adopted new regulations that impose siting requirements, or “setbacks,” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures. Under these new regulations and through thoughtful surface location planning, Occidental obtained COGCC approval for five Oil and Gas Development Plans, inclusive of 12 well pad and facility locations and approximately 150 wells. In addition to the approximately 150 wells approved through the Oil and Gas Development Plan process, during the third quarter of 2022, Occidental became the first oil and gas operator in Colorado to obtain COGCC approval for the first Comprehensive Area Plan under the new COGCC rules. This comprehensive plan will support nine well pads and approximately 140 new wells and will provide for substantial future development in a geographically remote area on Colorado’s eastern plains. Oil and Gas Development Plans associated with the Comprehensive Area Plan will be submitted in 2023.As of December 31, 2022, Occidental is permitted, or had permit applications submitted to applicable regulatory agencies, for nearly all planned 2023 drilling and completions activity in the DJ Basin. In 2023, Occidental plans to submit state and local permits with the goal of building operational inventory and maintaining its social license to operate in Colorado. Occidental has a dedicated stakeholder relations team that conducts regulatory and community outreach with respect to its permit applications and operations in Colorado with a focus on building trust and fostering open communication with those that live and work near our operations.Occidental has gained efficiencies in the permitting process and will continue to look for additional opportunities to do so. As discussed above, Occidental does not anticipate significant near-term changes to our development program in the DJ Basin based on these regulations. However, if Occidental is unable to obtain new drilling permits to develop a significant portion of the company’s undeveloped acreage in the DJ Basin, the company’s DJ Basin assets may be subject to testing for impairment, and if deemed to be impaired, such impairment could be material to our financial statements.Occidental has interest in over 300,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin, mainly located in Converse County and Campbell County, Wyoming. The field contains the Turner, Niobrara, Mowry and Parkman formations that hold both liquids and natural gas. In 2022, Occidental drilled 19 operated horizontal wells and completed 14 horizontal wells in the Powder River Basin. The company plans to run one continuous operated drilling rig in 2023 with targeted completion activity throughout the year.Occidental holds approximately 4.6 million net acres in other domestic locations, which consist of legacy acreage and fee minerals outside of Occidental’s core operated areas including parts of Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.OFFSHORE DOMESTIC ASSETSGulf of MexicoOccidental is the fourth-largest oil and gas producer in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico, operating 10 strategically located deep-water floating platforms, the highest number among all the deep water operators, and producing from 18 active fields while owning a working interest across 252 blocks, including approximately 1.0 million net acres. Occidental’s position is one of the largest portfolios in the Gulf of Mexico. Occidental further operates two marine shore-bases in Galveston, Texas, and Port Fourchon, Louisiana, as well as two helicopter bases in Louisiana that all provide back up and redundancy to each other to support the Gulf operations. A central logistics base with an integrated training center is located in Broussard, Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico operations and development are managed and supported with engineering and technical staff from The Woodlands, Texas, office tower. In 2022, Occidental increased net production to 147 Mboe/d from approximately 88 gross wells, investing over $450 million in capital, including exploration capital, primarily directed towards drilling activity in its new Horn Mountain West subsea development, Lucius and Holstein facilities, drilling five wells using one floating drill ship, one platform rig and several service rigs. Occidental successfully and safely initiated first production from its new Horn Mountain West field and tied back to the Horn Mountain facility, increasing production at the platform by over 34 Mboe/d from three subsea oil wells, OXY 2022 FORM 10-K29MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISon budget and three months ahead of schedule. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the new Caesar-Tonga Subsea Expansion project was also started several months ahead of schedule, debottlenecking the prolific giant Caesar-Tonga field and thus enabling future field expansion projects. Major subsea-pumping projects supporting the Marco Polo/K2 field and the Marlin/King field were progressed as well as extensive 4D seismic shoots in the Holstein field and elsewhere, setting up a runway of future development opportunities.Operational excellence and efficiency continued as the prime objective in 2022 and gathered further momentum, reducing overall base production decline rates through the implementation of several successful well stimulations and artificial lift projects. Platform operating efficiencies were significantly improved and machinery uptimes were increased all through subordinated focus and condition monitoring initiatives as well as multiple upgrade projects. Continued optimum sequencing of annual platform turn-arounds provided further operational efficiencies, avoiding around two hundred days per year of shut-ins.During 2022, all necessary regulatory permits for new wells and existing operations were obtained timely without any operational delays. Occidental was further awarded 30 new leases from BOEM’s Lease Sale 257 and was the second most successful bidder. Occidental’s Gulf of Mexico assets continued to be among the lowest carbon emissions operations in the industry with zero routine flaring and zero cold venting.The following table shows key areas of ongoing development in the Gulf of Mexico, along with the corresponding working interest in those areas.Working InterestHorn Mountain100 %Holstein100 %Marlin100 %Lucius67 %K2 Complex42 %Caesar Tonga34 %Constellation33 %In 2023, Occidental expects to continue development and expansion of its existing assets across the Gulf of Mexico, to safely deliver high-margin production while continuing to add to its drill well inventory on existing leases through expansion and infrastructure led exploration opportunities around existing infrastructure. Occidental plans to conduct development and exploration activities in 2023 using one to two floating drill ships, one platform rig and several other well service vessels and continue to optimize its extensive portfolio of lease working interests.30 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISINTERNATIONAL INTERESTSBUSINESS REVIEWOccidental conducts its ongoing international operations in two sub-regions: the Middle East and North Africa. Its activities include oil, NGL and natural gas production through direct working-interests, PSAs and PSCs. Under the PSCs, Occidental records a share of production and reserves to recover certain development and production costs and an additional share for profit. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to Occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on Occidental’s economic interest as defined in the contracts. Occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Overall, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater when product prices are higher. Approximately $0.5 billion of Occidental’s worldwide capital budget is expected to be allocated to its international operations in 2023.MIDDLE EAST / NORTH AFRICA ASSETS1.Algeria2.Oman3.Qatar4.UAEAlgeriaOccidental’s interest in Algeria involves development and production rights in 18 fields within Blocks 404a and 208, which are located in the Berkine Basin in Algeria’s Sahara Desert and are governed by an agreement amongst Occidental, Sonatrach and other partners. Occidental is responsible for 24.5% of the development and production costs. The El Merk central processing facility in Block 208 processes produced oil, NGL and natural gas, while the Hassi Berkine South and Ourhoud central processing facilities in Block 404a process produced oil. The rights to produce from the Block 404a fields expire between May 2023 and 2036, and the rights to produce from the Block 208 fields expire in 2032.In 2022, net production in Algeria was 45 Mbbl/d, two gross development wells were drilled and annual net capital expenditures were $25 million. In July 2022, Occidental signed a new PSC with Sonatrach and other partners which, upon approval by the Algerian government, will be for a new 25-year term for all of the fields under the current hydrocarbon agreement. With respect to the new PSC, Occidental is responsible for 35% of the development and production costs, and government approval is expected in the first half of 2023.OmanIn Oman, Occidental is the operator of Block 9, Block 27, Block 53 (Mukhaizna Field), Block 62 and Block 65 and has additional interests in Blocks 30, 51 and 72, which are under the Exploration phase. The working interest and contract expiration year for each of the respective blocks are shown in the table below. Occidental holds 6.0 million gross acres and has 10,000 potential well inventory locations. In 2022, Occidental’s share of production was 65 Mboe/d.

The Mukhaizna Field in Block 53 is a major pattern steam flood project for EOR that utilizes some of the largest mechanical vapor compressors ever built. Since assuming operations in the Mukhaizna Field in 2005, Occidental has drilled close to 3,580 new wells and has produced over 575 million gross barrels. In 2022, Occidental declared commerciality for Block 65 and invested capital of $362 million across all of the Oman blocks to drill 92 wells and execute facilities projects to support development and EOR activities.In 2023, Occidental will continue to enhance production by adding extended and dual laterals, stimulating wells with the OXY JETTINGTM wellbore stimulation system, and expanding thermal conformance. Occidental will also continue to execute projects in Oman targeting emissions reductions. QatarIn Qatar, Occidental partners in the Dolphin Energy Project, an investment that is comprised of two separate economic interests. Occidental has a 24.5% interest in the upstream operations (Dolphin) to develop and produce NGL, natural gas and condensate from Qatar’s North Field through mid-2032. Occidental also has a 24.5% interest in DEL, which operates a pipeline and is discussed further in the midstream and marketing segment section in this Form 10-K under Pipeline. In 2022, Occidental’s net share of production from Dolphin was 37 Mboe/d.UAEIn 2011, Occidental acquired a 40% participating interest in the Shah gas field (Al Hosn Gas), joining with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, which expires in 2041. In 2022, Occidental’s net share of production from Al Hosn Gas was 227 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas and 35 Mbbl/d of NGL and condensate. Al Hosn Gas includes gas processing facilities which are discussed further in the midstream and marketing segment section in this Form 10-K under Gas Processing, Gathering and CO2. In 2019 and 2020, Occidental acquired 9-year exploration concessions and, subject to a declaration of commerciality, 35-year production concessions for Onshore Block 3 and Block 5, which cover an area approximately 1.5 million acres and 1.0 million acres, respectively, and are adjacent to Al Hosn Gas. In 2022 and 2021, Occidental announced multi-zone oil and gas discoveries in Onshore Block 3. In 2023, Occidental plans to complete an expansion project that commenced in 2022 to increase the production capacity of the Al Hosn Gas processing facilities from 1.28 Bcf/d to 1.45 Bcf/d and continue further exploration and appraisal activities in Onshore Block 3 and Block 5. 32 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISPROVED RESERVESProved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves were estimated using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. Oil, NGL and natural gas prices used for this purpose were based on posted benchmark prices and adjusted for price differentials including gravity, quality and transportation costs. The following table shows the 2022, 2021 and 2020 calculated first-day-of-the-month average prices for both WTI and Brent oil prices, as well as the Henry Hub gas prices measured in MMbtu:202220212020WTI Oil ($/Bbl)$93.67 $66.56 $39.57 Brent Oil ($/Bbl)$97.77 $69.24 $43.41 Henry Hub Natural Gas ($/MMbtu)$6.36 $3.60 $1.98 Mt. Belvieu NGL ($/Bbl)$47.81 $44.22 $18.74 Occidental had proved reserves from continuing operations at year-end 2022 of 3,817 MMboe, compared to the year-end 2021 amount of 3,512 MMboe. Proved developed reserves represented approximately 71% and 75% of Occidental’s total proved reserves at year-end 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table shows the breakout of Occidental’s proved reserves from continuing operations by commodity as a percentage of total proved reserves:20222021Oil50 %50 %NGL22 %22 %Natural gas28 %28 %Occidental does not have any reserves from non-traditional sources. For further information regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, see the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information section in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.CHANGES IN PROVED RESERVESChanges in Occidental’s 2022 reserves were as follows:MMboe2022Revisions of previous estimates474 Improved recovery89 Extensions and discoveries176 Purchases10 Sales(21)Production(423)Total 305 Occidental’s ability to add reserves, other than through purchases, depends on the success of infill development, extension, discovery and improved recovery projects, each of which depends on reservoir characteristics, technology improvements and oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside management’s control and may negatively or positively affect Occidental’s reserves.Revisions of Previous EstimatesRevisions can include upward or downward changes to previous proved reserve estimates for existing fields due to the evaluation or interpretation of geologic, production decline or operating performance data. In addition, product price changes affect proved reserves recorded by Occidental. For example, lower prices may decrease the economically recoverable reserves, particularly for domestic properties, because the reduced margin limits the expected life of the operations. Offsetting this effect, lower prices increase Occidental’s share of proved reserves under PSCs because more oil is required to recover costs. Conversely, when prices rise, Occidental’s share of proved reserves decreases for PSCs and economically recoverable reserves may increase for other operations. Reserve estimation rules require that estimated ultimate recoveries be much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease, as changes are made due to increased availability of technical data. OXY 2022 FORM 10-K33MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISIn 2022, Occidental’s revisions of previous estimates of proved reserves were positive 474 MMboe. These revisions were primarily due to 335 MMboe of positive revisions related to additions associated with infill development projects, mainly in the Permian Basin (232 MMboe) and the DJ Basin (94 MMboe). An additional 136 MMboe of positive revisions were related price revisions. The positive price revisions were primarily associated with the Permian Basin (147 MMboe), the Gulf of Mexico (8 MMboe) and the DJ Basin (4 MMboe), which were partially offset by negative price revisions of 29 MMboe on international PSCs.Further positive revisions of 93 MMboe were associated with updates based on reservoir performance and 5 MMBoe were associated with management changes in development plans. The positive revisions were offset by negative revisions associated with various other cost and interest related revisions (95 MMboe).Improved RecoveryIn 2022, Occidental added proved reserves of 89 MMboe related to improved recovery, primarily in the Permian EOR, which accounted for 87% of the improved recovery reserve additions. These properties comprise conventional projects, which are characterized by the deployment of EOR development methods, largely employing application of CO2 flood, waterflood or steam flood. These types of conventional EOR development methods can be applied through existing wells, though additional drilling is frequently required to fully optimize the development configuration. Waterflooding is the technique of injecting water into the formation to displace the oil to the offsetting oil production wells. The use of either CO2 or steam flooding depends on the geology of the formation, the evaluation of engineering data, availability and cost of either CO2 or steam and other economic factors. Both techniques work similarly to lower viscosity causing the oil to move more easily to the producing wells. The remaining improved recovery additions were due to secondary and tertiary projects for certain international assets.Extensions and DiscoveriesOccidental also added proved reserves from extensions and discoveries, which are dependent on successful exploration and exploitation programs. In 2022, extensions and discoveries added 176 MMboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the Permian Basin (155 MMboe) and Powder River Basin (7 MMboe).Purchases of Proved ReservesIn 2022, Occidental purchased proved reserves of 10 MMboe primarily consisting of proved reserves in the Permian Basin.Sales of Proved ReservesIn 2022, Occidental sold 21 MMboe in proved reserves related to the divestitures of certain non-strategic assets in the Permian Basin.Proved Undeveloped ReservesOccidental had PUD reserves at year-end 2022 of 1,119 MMboe, compared to the year-end 2021 amount of 865 MMboe.Changes in PUD reserves were as follows:MMboe2022Revisions of previous estimates270 Improved recovery49 Extensions and discoveries107 Purchases1 Sales(10)Transfer to proved developed reserves(163)Total254 Revisions of previous estimates were a positive 270 MMboe. Approximately 263 MMboe of the positive revisions were related to additions associated with infill development projects in the Permian Basin (170 MMboe) and the DJ Basin (93 MMboe). Additionally, the revisions included positive price revisions of 24 MMboe. The positive price revisions were primarily associated with the Permian Basin. The remaining positive revisions were associated with various updates based on reservoir performance. The positive revisions were offset by negative revisions associated with various other cost and interest related revisions (21 MMboe).Extensions and discoveries added 107 MMboe primarily related to the recognition of proved reserves in the Permian Basin (100 MMboe). Total improved recovery additions of 49 MMboe were primarily the result of conventional projects in the Permian EOR (44 MMboe) and secondary and tertiary projects in international assets (5 MMboe). The 2022 additions to 34 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISPUD reserves were partially offset by transfers to proved developed reserves of 163 MMboe. The transfers were primarily associated with the Permian Basin (89 MMboe), the DJ Basin (40 MMboe) and Gulf of Mexico (21 MMboe). In 2022, Occidental incurred approximately $1.2 billion to convert PUD reserves to proved developed reserves, and in 2022 Occidental converted approximately 19% of its PUD reserves to proved developed, when adjusted for revisions and sales. As of December 31, 2022, Occidental had 1,119 MMboe of PUD reserves of which 73% were associated with domestic onshore, 4% with Gulf of Mexico and 23% with international assets. Occidental’s most active development areas are located in the Permian Basin, which represented 54% of the PUD reserves as of December 31, 2022. Occidental’s total planned 2023 capital expenditures are between $5.4 billion and $6.2 billion. Overall, Occidental plans to spend approximately $4.6 billion over the next five years to develop its PUD reserves in the Permian Basin.PUD reserves are supported by a five-year detailed field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled. Only PUD reserves which are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan. A portion of the PUD reserves are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development projects.As of December 31, 2022, Occidental had 241 MMboe of pre-2018 PUD reserves that remained undeveloped. These PUD reserves relate to approved long-term development plans, 175 MMboe of which are primarily associated with international development projects with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity and 66 MMboe of which are related to approved long-term development plans for Permian EOR projects, also with physical limitations in existing gas processing capacity. Occidental remains committed to these projects and continues to actively progress the development of these volumes. In addition to the above, Occidental has 57 MMboe of PUD reserves that are scheduled to be developed more than five years from their initial date of booking. These PUD reserves are related to approved long-term development plans, 41 MMboe of which are associated with international development projects and 16 MMboe with the Gulf of Mexico projects. RESERVES EVALUATION AND REVIEW PROCESSOccidental’s estimates of proved reserves and associated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2022, were made by Occidental’s technical personnel and are the responsibility of management. The estimation of proved reserves is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty of economic producibility and funding commitments by Occidental to develop the reserves. This process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts. As part of the proved reserves estimation process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. Price differentials between benchmark prices (the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the year) and realized prices and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the net reserves. Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analysis, type well profile analysis, computer simulation of the reservoir performance, volumetric analysis and material balance calculations that take into account the volumes of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated reservoir pressure changes supported by various technologies including seismic analysis. These reliable field-tested technologies have demonstrated reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. Operating and capital costs are forecast using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities.Net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods for which the incremental cost of any additional required investment is relatively minor.Net PUD reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. PUD reserves are supported by a five-year, detailed, field-level development plan, which includes the timing, location and capital commitment of the wells to be drilled. The development plan is reviewed and approved annually by senior management and technical personnel. Annually, a detailed review is performed by Occidental’s Corporate Reserves Group and its technical personnel on a lease-by-lease basis to assess whether PUD reserves are being converted on a timely basis within five years from the initial disclosure date. Any leases not showing timely transfers from PUD reserves to proved developed reserves are reviewed by senior management to determine if the remaining reserves will be developed in a timely manner and have sufficient capital committed in the development plan. Only PUD reserves that are reasonably certain to be drilled within five years of booking and are supported by a final investment decision to drill them are included in the development plan. A portion of the PUD reserves associated with international operations are expected to be developed beyond the five years and are tied to approved long-term development plans.The current Senior Vice President, Reserves for Oxy Oil and Gas is responsible for overseeing the preparation of reserve estimates, in compliance with SEC rules and regulations, including the internal audit and review of Occidental’s oil and gas reserves data. He has over 40 years of experience in the upstream sector of the exploration and production business and has held various assignments in North America, Asia and Europe. He is a three-time past Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers Oil and Gas Reserves Committee. He is an AAPG Certified Petroleum Geologist and currently serves on the AAPG Committee on Resource Evaluation. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers, the Colorado School of Mines Potential Gas Committee and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Expert OXY 2022 FORM 10-K35MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISGroup on Resource Management. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in geology from Emory University in Atlanta.Occidental has a Reserves Committee, consisting of senior corporate officers, to review and approve Occidental’s oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental’s Board of Directors during the year. Since 2003, Occidental has retained Ryder Scott, independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes. For additional reserves information, see Supplemental Oil and Gas Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.In 2022, Ryder Scott conducted a process review of the methods and analytical procedures utilized by Occidental’s engineering and geological staff for estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications as of December 31, 2022, in accordance with SEC regulatory standards. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for selected oil and gas properties considered to be a valid representation of Occidental’s 2022 year-end total proved reserves portfolio. In 2022, Ryder Scott reviewed approximately 42% of Occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves. Since being engaged in 2003, Ryder Scott has reviewed the specific application of Occidental’s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately 92% of Occidental’s existing proved oil and gas reserves.Management retained Ryder Scott to provide objective third-party input on its methods and procedures and to gather industry information applicable to Occidental’s reserve estimation and reporting process. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reasonableness of reserves quantities reported by Occidental. Occidental has filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.Based on its reviews, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that the overall procedures and methodologies Occidental utilized in estimating the proved reserves volumes, preparing the economic evaluations and determining the reserves classifications for the reviewed properties are appropriate for the purpose thereof and comply with current SEC regulations.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKThe oil and gas exploration and production industry is highly competitive, is subject to significant volatility due to various market conditions and operations are highly dependent on oil prices and, to a lesser extent, NGL and natural gas prices. Oil prices increased significantly in 2022. During 2022, as compared to 2021, the average annual $/Bbl of WTI crude increased to $94.23 from $67.91 and the average annual Brent price per barrel increased to $98.83 from $70.78.Oil prices will continue to be affected by: (i) global supply and demand, which are generally a function of global economic conditions, inventory levels, production or supply chain disruptions, technological advances, regional market conditions and the actions of OPEC, other significant producers and governments; (ii) transportation capacity, infrastructure constraints, and costs in producing areas; (iii) currency exchange rates and inflation rates; and (iv) the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions. The ongoing global impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and whether the oil industry will be able to sustain a continued supply response have resulted in an increase in benchmark oil prices year-over-year. Occidental does not operate or own assets in either Russia or Ukraine. It is expected that the price of oil will be volatile for the foreseeable future given the current geopolitical risks, the ongoing global impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, the evolving macro-economic environment and supply activity (as a result of COVID-19) from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries and the Biden Administration’s releases from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve.NGL prices are related to the supply and demand for the components of products making up these liquids. Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are used as feedstock. In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify the pricing volatility from region to region.Domestic natural gas prices and local differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand fundamentals, as well as government regulations, global LNG demand and availability of transportation capacity from producing areas.We expect that oil prices in the near term will continue to be influenced by the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting impact on oil and gas supply and demand. These and other factors make it difficult to predict the future direction of oil, NGL and domestic gas prices reliably. For purposes of the current capital plan, Occidental will continue to focus on allocating capital to high return assets with the flexibility to adjust based on fluctuations in commodity prices. International gas prices are generally fixed under long-term contracts. Occidental continues to adjust capital expenditures in line with current economic conditions, such as supply chain constraints, rising interest rates, global logistics and high inflation, which has continued to disrupt global supply and demand balances, with the goal of keeping returns well above its cost of capital. The timing, process and ultimate cost to transition to a less carbon-intensive economy remains largely unknown; various industry forecasts indicate a growing demand for hydrocarbons for the remainder of the current decade. Occidental believes its operational flexibility to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize full-cycle value of its assets and its knowledge and experience in CO2 separation, transportation, use, recycling and storage position its oil and gas segment to support Occidental’s transition to net zero as well as create opportunities in a low-carbon future. 36 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CHEMICAL SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYOxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain, beginning with the co-production of caustic soda and chlorine. Caustic soda and chlorine are marketed to external customers. In addition, chlorine, together with ethylene, is converted through a series of intermediate products into PVC. OxyChem seeks to be a low-cost producer in order to generate cash flow in excess of its normal capital expenditure requirements and achieve above-cost-of-capital returns. OxyChem’s focus on chlorovinyls allows it to maximize the benefits of integration and take advantage of economies of scale. Capital is employed to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects and developments designed to improve the competitiveness of segment assets. Acquisitions and plant development opportunities may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses or take advantage of other specific opportunities. The conversion of the Battleground chlor-alkali plant to membrane technology is expected to commence in 2023 with completion expected in 2026. In 2022, capital expenditures for OxyChem totaled $322 million.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTAlthough the United States economic growth lagged significantly behind that of 2021, demand for domestically produced products remained high, including liquid caustic soda and PVC. Lockdowns in China, along with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine increased the demand for U.S. produced products in 2022, as ethylene and energy costs remained advantaged over global pricing. Caustic soda prices were significantly higher in 2022 and PVC pricing trended downward during the second half of 2022, as supply chain constraints, rising interest rates, global logistics and high inflation continued to disrupt global supply and demand balances.BUSINESS REVIEWBASIC CHEMICALS Despite the slower U.S. economic growth in 2022, chlor-alkali operating rates increased compared to 2021 as the U.S. maintained its competitive advantage in energy and feedstock costs. Pricing and margins for most products were higher in 2022 due to strong demand in most market segments, and weather events and other supply disruptions restricted supply.VINYLSPVC demand softened in 2022 from record highs in 2021 resulting in a 7% decrease in domestic PVC demand. Export demand strengthened in 2022 by 46% compared to 2021. Year over year operating rates were flat in 2022 due to a softening PVC market during the second half of 2022 that was offset by the weather-related events experienced in early 2021. Higher interest rates, lower housing starts, and inflation contributed to the lower domestic PVC demand and US producers shifted available volumes to the export markets. PVC exports represented 27% of total North American production in 2022 compared to 19% in 2021.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKIndustry performance will depend on the health of the global economy. Response to inflation will continue to control the housing and construction sectors during 2023. Automotive markets are expected to improve as semiconductor supply normalizes and demand responds. Product margins will depend on market supply and demand balances, feedstock and energy prices, supply chain interruptions, labor constraints and rising inflation rates. Further recovery in the petroleum industry should strengthen the demand and margins for some of Occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants. U.S. commodity export markets could be impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar.BASIC CHEMICALSDemand for basic chemicals is expected to decline from the robust levels of 2022. Demand in most market segments is expected to follow the trend of the general economy throughout 2023. Demand for chlorine and derivatives should gradually improve across the year as international growth returns and the domestic housing, general construction and automotive markets begin to stabilize. Demand for alkali products, particularly caustic soda, may decline moderately with lower demand in the pulp and paper, industrial and alumina markets. Chlor-alkali operating rates should remain relatively flat overall in comparison with 2022 due to continued globally advantaged energy and raw material pricing as compared to global feedstock costs.VINYLSDomestic PVC demand is expected to remain neutral to lower in 2023. Residential construction spending is expected to be lower in 2023, while new domestic infrastructure projects and recovering global demand is expected to offset the domestic decline. New domestic PVC capacity came online in 2022 but is not expected to have a material impact on PVC production rates. OXY 2022 FORM 10-K37MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISMIDSTREAM AND MARKETING SEGMENTBUSINESS STRATEGYThe midstream and marketing segment strives to maximize value by optimizing the use of its gathering, processing, transportation, storage and terminal commitments and by providing the oil and gas segment access to domestic and international markets. To generate returns, the segment evaluates opportunities across the value chain and uses its assets to provide services to Occidental’s subsidiaries, as well as third parties. The midstream and marketing segment operates or contracts for services on gathering systems, gas plants, co-generation facilities and storage facilities and invests in entities that conduct similar activities.This segment also seeks to minimize the costs of gas and power used in Occidental’s various businesses. Capital is employed to sustain or expand assets to improve the competitiveness of Occidental’s businesses. In 2022, capital expenditures related to the midstream and marketing segment totaled $268 million.Also included in the midstream and marketing segment is OLCV. OLCV seeks to leverage Occidental’s carbon management expertise through the development of CCUS projects, and invests in emerging low-carbon technologies that are expected to reduce our carbon footprint and enable others to do the same.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTMidstream and marketing segment earnings are affected by the performance of its various businesses, including its marketing, gathering and transportation, gas processing and power-generation assets. The marketing business aggregates, markets and stores Occidental and third-party volumes. Marketing performance is affected primarily by commodity price changes and margins in oil and gas transportation and storage programs. The marketing business results can experience significant volatility depending on commodity prices and the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. The Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads have decreased from an average of $0.48 per barrel in 2021 to $0.36 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2022. A $0.25 change in the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads impacts total year operating cash flows by approximately $65 million. Gas gathering, processing and transportation results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment’s plants, as well as the margins obtained on related services from investments in which Occidental has an equity interest.BUSINESS REVIEWMARKETINGThe marketing group markets substantially all of Occidental’s oil, NGL and natural gas production and optimizes its transportation and storage capacity. Occidental’s third-party marketing activities focus on purchasing oil, NGL and natural gas for resale from parties whose oil and gas supply is located near its transportation and storage capacity. These purchases allow Occidental to aggregate volumes to better utilize and optimize its assets. In 2022, compared to the prior year, marketing results were impacted by the timing of crude oil sales, partially offset by higher gas marketing margin from transportation capacity optimization.DELIVERY AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITMENTSOccidental has made long-term commitments to certain refineries and other buyers to deliver oil, NGL and natural gas. The total amount contracted to be delivered is approximately 80 MMbbl of oil through 2025, 567 MMbbl of NGL through 2029 and 845 Bcf of gas through 2029. The price for these deliveries is set at the time of delivery of the product.Occidental has crude pipeline take-or-pay capacity of approximately 850 Mbbl/d to the Gulf Coast, leased crude storage capacity of approximately 10 MMbbl and capacity at the crude terminal of approximately 525 Mbbl/d. Certain of Occidental’s crude pipeline take-or-pay agreements expire in 2025 and take-or-pay commitments will reduce by two thirds by 2027.PIPELINEOccidental’s pipeline business mainly consists of its 24.5% ownership interest in DEL. DEL owns and operates a 230-mile-long, 48-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline, known as the Dolphin Pipeline, which transports dry natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman. The Dolphin Pipeline has capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf/d and currently transports approximately 2.0 Bcf/d and up to 2.2 Bcf/d in the summer months.GAS PROCESSING, GATHERING AND CO2Occidental processes its own and third-party domestic wet gas to extract NGL and other gas byproducts, including CO2 and delivers dry gas to pipelines. Margins primarily result from the difference between inlet costs of wet gas and market prices for NGL.As of December 31, 2022, Occidental owned all of the 2.3% non-voting general partner interest and 49.5% of the limited partner units in WES. On a combined basis, with its 2% non-voting limited partner interest in WES Operating, Occidental's total effective economic interest in WES and its subsidiaries was 51.7%. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information regarding 38 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOccidental’s equity method investment in WES. WES owns gathering systems, plants and pipelines and earns revenue from fee-based and service-based contracts with Occidental and third parties.Occidental’s 40% participating interest in Al Hosn Gas also includes sour gas processing facilities that are designed to process 1.33 Bcf/d of natural gas and separate it into salable gas, condensate, NGL and sulfur. In 2022, the project produced 568 MMcf/d of natural gas, 88 Mbbl/d of NGL and condensate, and 10,700 tons/d of sulfur, of which Occidental’s net share was 227 MMcf/d of natural gas, 35 Mbbl/d of NGL and condensate and 4,280 tons/d of sulfur.In 2022, compared to the prior year, gas processing, gathering and CO2 results increased primarily due to higher sulfur and NGL prices.POWER GENERATION FACILITIESEarnings from power and steam generation facilities are derived from sales to affiliates and third parties.LOW-CARBON VENTURESOLCV was formed to execute on Occidental’s vision to reduce global emissions and provide a more sustainable future through the development of low-carbon energy and products. OLCV capitalizes on Occidental’s extensive experience in utilizing CO2 in its development of CCUS projects and providing services to third parties to facilitate the implementation of their CCUS projects. Moreover, OLCV is fostering emerging technologies, including DAC and low-carbon power sources, and other business models with the potential to position Occidental as a leader in the production of low-carbon energy and products.Occidental has developed standards and protocols recognized by the EPA for monitoring, reporting and verifying the amount, safety and permanence of CO2 stored through secure geologic sequestration. Occidental holds the nation’s first two EPA-approved monitoring, reporting and verification plans for geologic sequestration through EOR production and obtained a third monitoring, reporting and verification plan in 2021. In 2022, OLCV acquired approximately three hundred thousand acres of pore space. In 2022, Occidental also commenced EPA Class 6 permitting with the intention of developing five sequestration hubs. OLCV commenced construction on the world’s largest DAC facility in 2022, which is expected to be online in 2025. OLCV is also currently conducting front-end engineering design work and feasibility studies on a number of projects to capture and sequester CO2, either from the atmosphere or from industrial point sources. In 2023, OLCV plans to invest between $100 million and $500 million, dependent upon potential partner participation, to pursue various projects.The profitability of sequestration projects is dependent upon the costs of developing, building and operating sequestration infrastructure, demand for sequestration services from emitters and the availability of certain tax attributes and credits generated from the capture and storage of CO2.In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act that contains, among other provisions, certain tax incentives related to climate change and clean energy. These incentives may attract more third-party investment of OLCV’s projects which may help accelerate certain projects. The ultimate impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on Occidental’s emerging low-carbon businesses and net-zero pathway will depend on a number of factors, interpretations and assumptions as well as additional regulatory guidance.INDUSTRY OUTLOOKMidstream and marketing segment results can experience volatility depending on commodity price changes, demand impacting export sales and the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads. Gas gathering, processing and transportation results are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and the volumes that are processed and transported through the segment’s plants, as well as the margins obtained on related services from investments in which Occidental has an equity interest.Throughout 2022, the U.S. experienced economy-wide cost increases, which could increase the cost of sequestration projects. Occidental saw increased interest from third parties in providing sequestration services during the year. Additionally, grants, credits and other tax-advantaged low-carbon attributes continue to be actively discussed at both state and federal levels. These trends are expected to continue, which Occidental believes will enhance the economics of sequestration projects.

Boe equivalent does not necessarily result in price equivalency. Please refer to the Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (unaudited) section of this Form 10-K for additional information on oil and gas production and sales.Average daily production volumes from ongoing operations remained materially consistent in 2022 as compared to 2021. Production increased in the Permian Basin due to increased development activity, which was partially offset by a decrease in production, especially natural gas, in the DJ Basin reflecting reduced capital investment and the impact of rising commodity prices that reduce Occidental's share of production under international production sharing contracts.Lease Operating ExpenseThe following table sets forth the average lease operating expense per Boe from ongoing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022:202220212020Average lease operating expense per Boe$9.52 $7.58 $6.38 Average lease operating expense per Boe increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily as a result of inflationary pressures which led to higher workover, support and maintenance costs in the Permian Basin, Rockies and Other and Gulf of Mexico, as well as higher purchase injectant costs in the Permian Basin.

Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets, net of any allowances, through future operating income and reversal of temporary differences. The total deferred tax liabilities were $7.7 billion and $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net deferred tax liability in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the legal entity reorganization that Occidental undertook in the first quarter of 2022. See more discussion below.WORLDWIDE EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for income from continuing operations:millions202220212020SEGMENT RESULTS Oil and gas$12,803 $4,145$(9,632)Chemical2,508 1,544664 Midstream and marketing273 257(4,175)Unallocated corporate items(1,467)(2,241)(2,562)Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes$14,117 $3,705$(15,705)Income tax benefit (expense) Federal and state248 (247)2,607 Foreign(1,061)(668)(435)Total income tax benefit (expense)(813)(915)2,172 Income (loss) from continuing operations$13,304 $2,790$(13,533)Worldwide effective tax rate6%25 %14%In 2022, Occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 6%, which was impacted by a tax benefit associated with Occidental's legal entity reorganization, as further described below.In 2021, Occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 25%, which was higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to higher tax rates in the foreign jurisdictions in which Occidental operates, partially offset by the tax impact of business credits, state tax revaluations and other domestic tax benefits.In 2020, Occidental’s worldwide effective tax rate was 14%, which was largely a result of the impairment of the WES goodwill and certain international assets for which Occidental received no tax benefit and higher-taxed international operations which generally caused Occidental’s tax rate to vary significantly from the U.S. corporate tax rate.LEGAL ENTITY REORGANIZATIONTo align Occidental’s legal entity structure with the nature of its business activities after completing the Anadarko Acquisition and subsequent large scale post-acquisition divestiture program, management undertook a legal entity reorganization that was completed in the first quarter of 2022.As a result of this legal entity reorganization, management made an adjustment to the tax basis in a portion of its operating assets, thus reducing Occidental’s deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, in 2022, Occidental recorded a tax benefit of $2.7 billion in connection with this reorganization. The timing of any reduction in Occidental’s future cash taxes as a result of this legal entity reorganization will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing commodity prices, capital activity level and production mix. The legal entity reorganization transaction is currently under IRS review as part of the Company’s 2022 federal tax audit.INFLATION REDUCTION ACT In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act that contains, among other provisions, a corporate book minimum tax on financial statement income, an excise tax on stock buybacks, a methane emissions fee and certain tax incentives related to climate change and clean energy. Occidental is currently evaluating the provisions of this act. The ultimate impact of the act is yet to be determined and will depend on additional regulatory guidance and interpretations.

The increase in net sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher realized commodity prices in the oil and gas segment. Chemical sales increased primarily due to higher prices and volumes across all product lines. The increase in midstream and marketing sales was due to higher crude oil prices impacting the marketing businesses.EXPENSE ITEMSmillions202220212020Oil and gas operating expense$4,028 $3,160 $3,065 Transportation and gathering expense$1,475 $1,419 $1,600 Chemical and midstream cost of sales$3,273 $2,772 $2,408 Purchased commodities$3,287 $2,308 $1,395 Selling, general and administrative$945 $863 $864 Other operating and non-operating expense$1,271 $1,065 $884 Taxes other than on income$1,548 $1,005 $622 Depreciation, depletion and amortization$6,926 $8,447 $8,097 Asset impairments and other charges$— $304 $11,083 Anadarko Acquisition-related costs$89 $153 $339 Exploration expense$216 $252 $132 Interest and debt expense, net$1,030 $1,614 $1,424 OIL AND GAS OPERATING EXPENSEOil and gas operating expense increased in 2022 from the prior year, primarily as a result of higher workovers, supports and maintenance costs in the Permian Basin, Rockies and Other and Gulf of Mexico, as well as higher purchase injectant costs in the Permian Basin. CHEMICAL AND MIDSTREAM COST OF SALESChemical and midstream cost of sales increased in 2022 from the prior year, primarily due to higher raw material costs in the chemical segment, primarily energy costs, and increased power generation costs in the midstream and marketing segment.PURCHASED COMMODITIESPurchased commodities increased in 2022 from the prior year, largely as a result of higher prices on third-party crude purchases related to the midstream and marketing segment.OTHER OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING EXPENSEOther operating and non-operating expense increased in 2022 from the prior year, primarily due to increases in employee related costs and environmental remediation expenses.DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATIONDD&A expense decreased in 2022 from the prior year, primarily as a result of lower per Boe DD&A rates due to higher proved reserves as a result of positive program adds during 2021.46 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER CHARGESThere were no asset impairments in 2022. In 2021, asset impairments and other charges of $304 million were mainly comprised of the impairment of undeveloped leases that either expired or were set to expire in the near term where Occidental had no plans to pursue exploration activities.TAXES OTHER THAN ON INCOMETaxes other than on income in 2022 increased from the prior year, primarily due to higher production taxes, which are directly tied to revenues, and higher ad valorem taxes.INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE, NETInterest and debt expense decreased in 2022 from the prior year, due to lower outstanding debt as a result of debt repayments.OTHER ITEMSIncome (expense) millions202220212020Gains (losses) on interest rate swaps and warrants$317 $122 $(423)Income from equity investments$793 $631 $370 Income tax benefit (expense)$(813)$(915)$2,172 Loss from discontinued operations, net$— $(468)$(1,298)LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NETThere were no discontinued operations in 2022.

In addition, discontinued operations, net was associated with operations in Ghana which were sold in October 2021.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH ON HANDAs of December 31, 2022, Occidental had approximately $1.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents. A substantial majority of this cash is held and available for use in the United States.SOURCES AND USES OF CASHOccidental currently expects its operational cash flows and cash on hand to be sufficient to meet its current debt maturities and other obligations for the next 12 months from the date of this filing. Should commodity prices return to their 2020 lows, Occidental’s $4.0 billion RCF, receivables securitization facility and access to capital markets are available to meet its ongoing capital needs, purchase obligations, near-term debt maturities and other liabilities and financial obligations, if required.Occidental’s planned 2023 capital expenditures are between $5.4 billion and $6.2 billion, of which only a small percentage is allocated to non-cancellable commitments. As of December 31, 2022, Occidental had $22 million in current maturities of long-term debt which were paid in January 2023, and an additional $1.1 billion in long-term obligations due in 2024.As of December 31, 2022, Occidental had $433 million in non-cancelable lease payments due in 2023, and an additional $335 million in non-cancelable lease payments due in 2024. Dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022.Occidental is party to various purchase agreements that are not accounted for as leases or otherwise accrued as liabilities as of December 31, 2022. These agreements consist primarily of obligations to secure terminal, pipeline and processing capacity, purchase services used in the normal course of business including transporting and disposing of produced water, purchase goods used in the production of finished goods including certain chemical raw materials and power and agreements relating to equipment maintenance and service. The amounts that will be paid for such outstanding off-balance sheet purchase obligations as of December 31, 2022 are $3.0 billion in 2023, $4.2 billion in 2024 and 2025, $2.5 billion in 2026 and 2027 and $2.2 billion in 2028 and thereafter.SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMUnder the $3.0 billion share repurchase program announced and completed in 2022, Occidental purchased approximately 47.7 million shares. In February 2023, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $3.0 billion of Occidental’s shares of common stock.

Changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and judgments and actual results may differ from these estimates upon settlement but generally not by material amounts. The selection and development of these policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve management’s judgment.OIL AND GAS PROPERTIESThe carrying value of Occidental’s PP&E represents the cost incurred to acquire or develop the asset, including any AROs and capitalized interest, net of DD&A and any impairment charges. For assets acquired in a business combination, PP&E cost is based on fair values at the acquisition date. AROs and interest costs incurred in connection with qualifying capital expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.Occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, Occidental capitalizes costs of acquiring properties, costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs. The costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. If proved reserves have been found, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. For exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and operating viability of the project. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and in particular, whether Occidental is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.Occidental expenses annual lease rentals, the costs of injectants used in production and geological and geophysical costs as incurred for exploration activities.Occidental determines depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties by the unit-of-production method. It amortizes leasehold acquisition costs over total proved reserves and capitalized development and successful exploration costs over proved developed reserves.Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Several factors could change Occidental’s proved oil and gas reserves. For example, Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover its costs and generally an additional share for profit. Occidental’s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product prices rise and increases when prices decline. Generally, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher product prices. In other cases, particularly with long-lived properties, lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of a portion of proved reserves becomes uneconomical. For such properties, higher product prices typically result in additional reserves becoming economical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond Occidental’s control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors, in turn, could lead to changes in the quantity of proved reserves. Additional factors that could result in a change of proved reserves include production decline rates and operating performance differing from those estimated when the proved reserves were initially recorded. Changes in the political and regulatory climate could lead to decreases in proved reserves as development horizons may be extended into the future. Occidental performs impairment tests with respect to its proved properties whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recoverable. If there is an indication the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered due to significant and prolonged declines in current and forward prices, significant changes in reserve estimates, changes in management’s plans or other significant events, management will evaluate the property for impairment. Under the successful efforts method, if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the proved property, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment charge in the period. Individual proved properties are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows unless observable and comparable transactions are available. The fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by market participants. The impairment test incorporates a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash flows which can change significantly over time. These assumptions include estimates of future production, product prices, contractual prices, estimates of risk-adjusted oil and gas proved and unproved reserves and estimates of OXY 2022 FORM 10-K51MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISfuture operating and development costs. It is reasonably possible that prolonged declines in commodity prices, reduced capital spending in response to lower prices or increases in operating costs could result in impairments.For impairment testing, unless prices are contractually fixed, Occidental uses observable forward strip prices for oil and natural gas prices when projecting future cash flows. Future operating and development costs are estimated using the current cost environment applied to expectations of future operating and development activities to develop and produce oil and gas reserves. Market prices for oil, NGL and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future. Changes in global supply and demand, transportation capacity, currency exchange rates, applicable laws and regulations and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions could impact current forecasts. Future fluctuations in commodity prices could result in estimates of future cash flows to vary significantly. Net capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties were $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, and $14.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. The unproved amounts are not subject to DD&A until they are classified as proved properties. Individually insignificant unproved properties are combined and amortized on a group basis based on factors such as lease terms, success rates and other factors to provide for full amortization upon lease expiration or abandonment. Significant unproved properties, primarily as a result of the Anadarko Acquisition, are assessed individually for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property may not be recovered a valuation allowance is provided if an impairment is indicated. Occidental periodically reviews significant unproved properties for impairments; numerous factors are considered, including but not limited to, availability of funds for future exploration and development activities, current exploration and development plans, favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property or the adjacent property, geologists’ evaluation of the property, the current and projected political and regulatory climate, contractual conditions and the remaining lease term for the properties. If an impairment is indicated, Occidental will first determine whether a comparable transaction for similar properties or implied acreage valuation derived from domestic onshore market participants is available and will adjust the carrying amount of the unproved property to its fair value using the market approach. In situations where the market approach is not observable and unproved reserves are available, undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on managements’ risk adjusted estimates of unproved reserves, future commodity prices and future costs to produce the reserves. If undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. Occidental utilizes the same assumptions and methodology discussed above for cash flows associated with proved properties. PROVED RESERVESOccidental estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC’s Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X and Financial Accounting Standards Board. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. Occidental’s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments.The most significant ongoing financial statement effect from a change in Occidental’s oil and gas reserves or impairment of its proved properties would be to the DD&A rate. For example, a 5% increase or decrease in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the DD&A rate by approximately $0.60/Bbl, which would increase or decrease pre-tax income by approximately $270 million annually at current production rates. FAIR VALUESOccidental estimates fair-value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets and initial measurements of AROs.Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is 52 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISrecorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value, which may be determined using different methods of fair value measurements, largely based on the availability and quality of market information. Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements, maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs. FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIESOccidental utilizes published prices or counterparty statements for valuing the majority of its financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value. In addition to using market data, Occidental makes assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental measures fair value using the following methods:■Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the balance sheet date. These derivatives are classified as using quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities (Level 1).■OTC bilateral financial commodity contracts, international exchange contracts, options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified as using observable inputs other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities (Level 2) and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.■Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. The assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions and the fair value is designated as using unobservable inputs (Level 3) within the valuation hierarchy.■Occidental values debt using market-observable information for debt instruments that are traded on secondary markets. For debt instruments that are not traded, the fair value is determined by interpolating the value based on debt with similar terms and credit risk.NON-FINANCIAL ASSETSOccidental uses market-observable prices for assets when comparable transactions can be identified that are similar to the asset being valued. When Occidental is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or for a similar asset then the cost or income approach is used depending on the quality of information available to support management’s assumptions. The cost approach is based on management’s best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management’s best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and the expected cash flows are discounted using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment. The results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates and other factors, most of which are often outside of management’s control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant’s view of long-term prices, costs and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in Occidental’s business plans and investment decisions.ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURESCertain subsidiaries of Occidental incur environmental liabilities and expenditures that relate to current operations and are expensed or capitalized by such subsidiaries as appropriate. Certain subsidiaries also incur environmental liabilities and expenditures with respect to remediation of existing conditions from alleged past practices at Third-Party, Currently Operated, and Closed or Non-operated Sites. Those environmental liabilities and related charges and expenses for estimated remediation costs from past operations are recorded when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Occidental discloses such remediation liabilities on a consolidated basis. In determining the environmental remediation liability and the range of reasonably possible additional losses, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience, remedial objectives, available technologies, applicable laws and regulations and cost-sharing arrangements. These environmental remediation liabilities are based on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred, using the most cost-effective technology reasonably expected to achieve the remedial objective. Occidental periodically reviews these environmental remediation liabilities and adjusts them as new information becomes available. Occidental’s subsidiaries generally record reimbursements or recoveries of environmental remediation costs in income when received, or when receipt of recovery is highly probable.Many factors could affect future remediation costs incurred by Occidental’s subsidiaries and result in adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and the range of reasonably possible additional losses. The most significant are: (1) cost estimates for remedial activities may vary from the initial estimate; (2) the length of time, type or amount of remediation necessary to achieve the remedial objective may change due to factors such as site conditions, the ability to identify and OXY 2022 FORM 10-K53MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIScontrol contaminant sources or the discovery of additional contamination; (3) a regulatory agency may ultimately reject or modify proposed remedial plans; (4) improved or alternative remediation technologies may change remediation costs; (5) laws and regulations may change remediation requirements or affect cost sharing or allocation of liability; and (6) changes in allocation or cost-sharing arrangements may occur.Certain sites involve multiple parties with various cost-sharing arrangements, which generally fall into the following three categories: (1) environmental proceedings that result in a negotiated or prescribed allocation of remediation costs among the affected Occidental’s subsidiary and other alleged potentially responsible parties; (2) oil and gas ventures in which each participant pays its proportionate share of remediation costs reflecting its working interest; or (3) contractual arrangements, typically relating to purchases and sales of properties, in which the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating remediation costs. In these circumstances, the affected subsidiary evaluates the financial viability of other parties with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to such subsidiary of their failure to participate when estimating its ultimate share of liability. Occidental subsidiaries record environmental remediation liabilities at their expected net cost of remedial activities. Based on these factors, except as otherwise disclosed in Note 12 - Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Occidental’s subsidiaries believe that they will not be required to assume a share of liability of such other potentially responsible parties in an amount materially above amounts reserved.In addition to the costs of investigations and clean-up measures, which often take in excess of 10 years at CERCLA NPL sites, Occidental subsidiaries’ environmental remediation liabilities include estimates of the costs to operate and maintain remedial systems. If remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations, technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental’s subsidiaries review and adjust their environmental remediation liabilities accordingly.If Occidental or its subsidiaries were to adjust the balance of their environmental remediation liabilities based on the factors described above, the amount of the increase or decrease would be recognized in earnings. For example, if the balance were reduced by 10%, Occidental would record a pre-tax increase to income of $105 million. If the balance were increased by 10%, Occidental would record an additional remediation expense of $105 million.INCOME TAXESOccidental and its subsidiaries file various U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns. The impact of changes in tax regulations are reflected when enacted. In general, deferred federal, state and foreign income taxes are provided on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Occidental routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets. If Occidental concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Occidental recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recorded is equal to the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized through final settlement with a taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense (benefit). See Note 10 - Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.LOSS CONTINGENCIESOccidental or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings and audits. Occidental or its affected subsidiaries, as appropriate, accrues reserves for these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate on a consolidated basis, exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred. Occidental reviews such loss contingencies on an ongoing basis.Loss contingencies are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate. Management’s judgments could change based on new information, changes in, or interpretations of, laws or regulations, changes in management’s plans or intentions, opinions regarding the outcome of legal proceedings or other factors. See Note 13 - Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.54 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSAFE HARBOR DISCUSSION REGARDING OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING DATAPortions of this report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Occidental does not undertake any obligation to update, modify or withdraw any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Although Occidental believes that the expectations reflected in any of its forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially. In addition, historical, current and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Factors that could cause results to differ from those projected or assumed in any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, including slowdowns and recessions, domestically or internationally; Occidental’s indebtedness and other payment obligations, including the need to generate sufficient cash flows to fund operations; Occidental’s ability to successfully monetize select assets and repay or refinance debt and the impact of changes in Occidental’s credit ratings; the scope and duration of the global or regional health pandemics or epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic; assumptions about energy markets; global and local commodity and commodity-futures pricing fluctuations and volatility; supply and demand considerations for, and the prices of, Occidental’s products and services; actions by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries; results from operations and competitive conditions; future impairments of Occidental's proved and unproved oil and gas properties or equity investments, or write-downs of productive assets, causing charges to earnings; unexpected changes in costs; inflation, its impact on markets and economic activity and related monetary policy actions by governments in response to inflation; availability of capital resources, levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations; the regulatory approval environment, including Occidental's ability to timely obtain or maintain permits or other governmental approvals, including those necessary for drilling and/or development projects; Occidental's ability to successfully complete, or any material delay of, field developments, expansion projects, capital expenditures, efficiency projects, acquisitions or dispositions; risks associated with acquisitions, mergers and joint ventures, such as difficulties integrating businesses, uncertainty associated with financial projections, projected synergies, restructuring, increased costs and adverse tax consequences; uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested properties and businesses; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves; lower-than-expected production from development projects or acquisitions; Occidental’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from prior or future streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes and improve Occidental’s competitiveness; exploration, drilling and other operational risks; disruptions to, capacity constraints in, or other limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver Occidental’s oil and natural gas and other processing and transportation considerations; volatility in the securities, capital or credit markets; governmental actions, war (including the Russia-Ukraine war) and political conditions and events; environmental risks and liability under federal, regional, state, provincial, tribal, local and international environmental laws, and regulations, and litigation (including the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future laws, regulations and litigation); legislative or regulatory changes, including changes relating to hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operations, retroactive royalty or production tax regimes, deep-water and onshore drilling and permitting regulations and environmental regulations (including regulations related to climate change); Occidental's ability to recognize intended benefits from its business strategies and initiatives, such as Occidental's low carbon ventures businesses or announced greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets or net-zero goals; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; disruption or interruption of production or manufacturing or facility damage due to accidents, chemical releases, labor unrest, weather, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or insurgent activity; the creditworthiness and performance of Occidental's counterparties, including financial institutions, operating partners and other parties; failure of risk management; Occidental’s ability to retain and hire key personnel; supply, transportation, and labor constraints; reorganization or restructuring of Occidental’s operations; changes in state, federal or international tax rates; and actions by third parties that are beyond Occidental's control.Additional information concerning these and other factors that may cause Occidental’s results of operations and financial position to differ from expectations can be found in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, as well as in Occidental’s other filings with the SEC, including Occidental’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. OXY 2022 FORM 10-K55QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKCOMMODITY PRICE RISKGENERALOccidental’s results are sensitive to fluctuations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices. Price changes at current global prices and levels of production affect Occidental’s budgeted 2023 pre-tax annual income by approximately $200 million for a $1 per barrel change in oil prices and approximately $30 million for a $1 per barrel change in NGL prices. If domestic natural gas prices varied by $0.10 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on Occidental’s budgeted 2023 pre-tax income of approximately $30 million. These price-change sensitivities include the impact of PSC and similar contract volume changes on income. If production levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental’s results to prices also will change. Marketing results are sensitive to price changes of oil, natural gas and, to a lesser degree, other commodities. A $0.25 change in the Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads impacts budgeted 2023 operating cash flows by approximately $65 million.Occidental’s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices. A variation in chlorine and caustic soda prices of $10 per ton would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $10 million and $30 million, respectively. A variation in PVC prices of $0.01 per lb. would have a pre-tax annual effect on income of approximately $30 million. Historically, over time, product price changes have tracked raw material and feedstock product price changes, somewhat mitigating the effect of price changes on margins.RISK MANAGEMENTOccidental conducts its risk management activities for marketing and trading under the controls and governance of its risk control policies. The controls under these policies are implemented and enforced by a risk management group which monitors risk by providing an independent and separate evaluation and check. Members of the risk management group report to the Corporate Vice President and Treasurer. Controls for these activities include limits on value at risk, limits on credit, limits on total notional trade value, segregation of duties, delegation of authority, daily price verifications, reporting to senior management on various risk measures and a number of other policy and procedural controls.FAIR VALUE OF MARKETING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTSOccidental carries derivative contracts it enters into in connection with its marketing activities at fair value. Fair values for these contracts are derived from Level 1 and Level 2 sources. The fair values in future maturity periods are insignificant. The following table shows the fair value of Occidental’s derivatives (excluding collateral), segregated by maturity periods and by methodology of fair value estimation:Maturity Periods Source of Fair Value Assets (Liabilities)millions20232024 and 20252026 and 20272028 and thereafterTotalPrices actively quoted$(18)$— $— $— $(18)Prices provided by other external sources31 1 — — 32 Total$13 $1 $— $— $14 QUANTITATIVE INFORMATIONOccidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity contracts used in trading activities. This measure determines the maximum potential negative one day change in fair value with a 95% level of confidence. Additionally, Occidental uses complementary trading limits including position and tenor limits and maintains liquid positions as a result of which market risk typically can be neutralized or mitigated on short notice. As a result of these controls, Occidental believes that the market risk of its trading activities is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on its performance.56 OXY 2022 FORM 10-KQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESINTEREST RATE RISK GENERALAs of December 31, 2022, Occidental had fixed rate debt with a fair value of $17.5 billion outstanding. A 25-basis point change in Treasury rates would change the fair value of the fixed rate debt approximately $295 million.The table below provides information about Occidental’s long-term debt obligations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Occidental’s international operations have limited currency risk. Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and limiting cash positions in foreign currencies to levels necessary for operating purposes. A vast majority of international oil sales are denominated in United States dollars. Additionally, all of Occidental’s consolidated international oil and gas subsidiaries have the United States dollar as the functional currency. The effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income. CREDIT RISK The majority of Occidental’s counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy commodities to its customers and any inability of these customers to meet their settlement commitments. Occidental manages credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by entering into netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral or other credit risk mitigants, as appropriate. Occidental actively evaluates the creditworthiness of its counterparties, assigns appropriate credit limits and monitors credit exposures against those assigned limits. Occidental also enters into futures contracts through regulated exchanges with select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk, if any.As of December 31, 2022, the substantial majority of the credit exposures were with investment grade counterparties. Occidental believes its exposure to credit-related losses as of December 31, 2022, was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been insignificant for all years presented.
