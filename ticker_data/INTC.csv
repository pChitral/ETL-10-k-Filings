50863,INTC,INTEL CORP,2014,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. MD&A is organized as follows:•Overview. Discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the company in order to provide context for the remainder of MD&A.•Critical Accounting Estimates. Accounting estimates that we believe are most important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts.•Results of Operations. An analysis of our financial results comparing 2013 to 2012 and comparing 2012 to 2011.•Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity.•Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Discussion of the methodologies used in the valuation of our financial instruments.•Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. Overview of contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off-balance-sheet arrangements outstanding as of December 28, 2013, including expected payment schedule.The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 14, 2014.OverviewOur results of operations for each period were as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dec. 28,2013 Sept. 28,2013 Change Dec. 28,2013 Dec. 29,2012 ChangeNet revenue $13,834 $13,483 $351 $52,708 $53,341 $(633)Gross margin $8,571 $8,414 $157 $31,521 $33,151 $(1,630)Gross margin percentage 62.0% 62.4% (0.4)% 59.8% 62.1% (2.3)%Operating income $3,549 $3,504 $45 $12,291 $14,638 $(2,347)Net income $2,625 $2,950 $(325) $9,620 $11,005 $(1,385)Diluted earnings per common share $0.51 $0.58 $(0.07) $1.89 $2.13 $(0.24)Revenue for 2013 was down 1% from 2012. PCCG experienced lower platform unit sales in the first half of the year, but saw offsetting growth in the back half as the PC market began to show signs of stabilization. DCG continued to benefit from the build out of Internet cloud computing and the strength of our product portfolio resulting in increased platform volumes for DCG for the year. Higher factory start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology led to a decrease in gross margin compared to 2012. In response to the current business environment and to better align resources, management approved several restructuring actions including targeted workforce reductions as well as the exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges of $240 million for 2013.28Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Our Q4 2013 revenue of $13.8 billion was up 3% from Q3 2013. The sequential increase was a result of stabilization in the PC market which generated 3% higher platform unit sales for PCCG. Gross margin remained flat sequentially as lower platform unit costs were offset by higher factory start-up costs for our 14nm process technology. The platform unit cost decline is attributable to our 22nm process technology coming down the cost curve as we ramp the 4th generation Intel Core processor family products in multiple fabrication facilities. In 2013, we introduced many new product technologies across all of our businesses. Our product launches included the 4th generation Intel Core processor family, Intel Xeon 22nm processors, and Intel Atom microarchitecture platforms. As 2013 progressed, we shifted our focus and investment strategy in order to increase our cadence for bringing innovative products to market. One example is the announcement of Intel Quark SoC which is an ultra-low power and cost architecture designed for the Internet of Things, from industrial machines to future wearable devices. The cash generation from our business remained strong with cash from operations of $20.8 billion in 2013. We ended the year with an investment portfolio of $20.1 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. We returned $4.5 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. We purchased $10.7 billion in capital assets as we continued making investments in new architectures and product offerings. In January 2014, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share to be paid in Q1 2014.Looking ahead to 2014, we expect revenue and gross margin to remain flat. We believe our product offerings and architectures will enable innovation and allow for future growth in the PC market through all-in-ones, 2 in 1s, convertibles and detachables. The launch of new low-power, high-performance products will continue to expand our footprint in tablets and our Internet of Things business. We also continue to make progress with the industry’s first 14nm manufacturing process and our second generation 3-D transistors (code-named “Broadwell”). Our second generation 3-D transistors will begin production in Q1 2014 and is expected to launch in the second half of 2014. As we continue to align resources to focus on tablets, low-power SoCs, and the data center, we will also streamline our overall investment position in order to hold spending flat for the year. Our Business Outlook for Q1 2014 and full-year 2014 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (R&D plus MG&A), and capital expenditures. We will keep our most current Business Outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site www.intc.com. This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K. The statements in the Business Outlook and forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. The forward-looking statements in the Business Outlook will be effective through the close of business on March 14, 2014, unless updated earlier. From the close of business on March 14, 2014, until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for April 15, 2014, we will observe a “quiet period.” During the quiet period, the Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 16, 2014, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our Business Outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.29Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Critical Accounting EstimatesThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include:•the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments;•the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and•the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment.In the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.Non-Marketable Equity InvestmentsWe regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ($2.2 billion as of December 29, 2012).Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success depends on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenue, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The valuation of these non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees’ capital structures, the terms of the investees’ issued interests, and the lack of marketability of the investments.30Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as:•the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects;•the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies;•the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory and economic changes;•factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and•the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation.If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $112 million in 2013 ($104 million in 2012 and $63 million in 2011).Long-Lived AssetsProperty, Plant and EquipmentWe assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized.Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. Based on our analysis, impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property, plant, and equipment was $172 million in 2013 ($73 million in 2012 and $100 million in 2011).GoodwillGoodwill is recorded when the purchase price for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in “Note 27: Operating Segments and Geographic Information” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit.31Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference.Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. These estimates are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt.For the annual impairment assessment in 2013, we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill, it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units. During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we have completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.Identified IntangiblesWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment assessment, we recognized impairment charges of $17 million in 2013 ($21 million in 2012 and $10 million in 2011).Income TaxesWe must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.32Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not more likely than not, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes.We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.We have not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on certain undistributed non-U.S. earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in the various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.InventoryIntel has a product development lifecycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities, and associated costs, change in nature from R&D to cost of sales. In order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as product release qualification (PRQ). We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. To determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were $319 million in 2013 ($540 million in 2012 and $46 million in 2011).Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, customer acceptance of our products, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. If the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value, we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales.The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The demand forecast is utilized in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.33Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims, as well as accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata and product warranties that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to the return rates to our customers, our customers' return rates, and the costs to repair or replace parts. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.Accounting ChangesFor a description of accounting changes, see “Note 3: Accounting Changes” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Results of OperationsCertain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for each period were as follows: 2013 2012 2011(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenueNet revenue $52,708 100.0 % $53,341 100.0% $53,999 100.0%Cost of sales 21,187 40.2 % 20,190 37.9% 20,242 37.5%Gross margin 31,521 59.8 % 33,151 62.1% 33,757 62.5%Research and development 10,611 20.1 % 10,148 19.0% 8,350 15.4%Marketing, general and administrative 8,088 15.3 % 8,057 15.1% 7,670 14.2%Restructuring and asset impairment charges 240 0.5 % — —% — —%Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 291 0.6 % 308 0.6% 260 0.5%Operating income 12,291 23.3 % 14,638 27.4% 17,477 32.4%Gains (losses) on equity investments, net 471 0.9 % 141 0.3% 112 0.2%Interest and other, net (151) (0.3)% 94 0.2% 192 0.3%Income before taxes 12,611 23.9 % 14,873 27.9% 17,781 32.9%Provision for taxes 2,991 5.7 % 3,868 7.3% 4,839 8.9%Net income $9,620 18.3 % $11,005 20.6% $12,942 24.0%Diluted earnings per common share $1.89 $2.13 $2.39 Our net revenue for 2013 decreased by $633 million, or 1%, compared to 2012. The PCCG and DCG platform unit sales decreased by 3%. Additionally, lower netbook platform and feature and entry phone component unit sales contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher PCCG and DCG platform average selling prices, which were up 2%, as well as higher ISG platform average selling prices.Our overall gross margin dollars for 2013 decreased by $1.6 billion, or 5%, compared to 2012. The decrease was due in large part to $1.8 billion of higher factory start-up costs primarily for our next-generation 14nm process technology. To a lesser extent, lower overall revenue from our Other IA operating segments, primarily in our phone and mobile component businesses and netbook group, as well as lower PCCG and DCG platform revenue contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG platform revenue, approximately $325 million of lower PCCG and DCG platform unit costs, and $221 million of lower excess capacity charges.34Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 59.8% in 2013 from 62.1% in 2012. The decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in PCCG. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2013 and 2012 from the sale of platforms in the PCCG and DCG operating segments. Our net revenue for 2012, which included 52 weeks, decreased by $658 million, or 1%, compared to 2011, which included 53 weeks. The PCCG and DCG platform unit sales decreased 1% while average selling prices were unchanged. Additionally, lower netbook platform unit sales and Multi-Comm average selling prices, primarily discrete modems, contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by our McAfee operating segment, which we acquired in the Q1 2011. McAfee contributed $469 million of additional revenue in 2012 compared to 2011.Our overall gross margin dollars for 2012 decreased by $606 million, or 2%, compared to 2011. The decrease was due in large part to $494 million of excess capacity charges, as well as lower revenue from the PCCG and DCG platform. To a lesser extent, approximately $390 million of higher unit costs on the PCCG and DCG platform as well as lower netbook and Multi-Comm revenue contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by $643 million of lower factory start-up costs as we transition from our 22nm process technology to R&D of our next-generation 14nm process technology, as well as $422 million of charges recorded in 2011 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel® 6 Series Express Chipset family. The decrease was also partially offset by the two additional months of results from our acquisition of McAfee, which occurred on February 28, 2011, contributing approximately $334 million of additional gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 2011. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a $557 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2012, compared to $482 million in 2011, primarily due to acquisitions completed in Q1 2011.Our overall gross margin percentage in 2012 was flat from 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher unit costs on the PCCG and DCG platform were offset by lower factory start-up costs and no impact in 2012 for a design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 and 2011 from the sale of platforms in the PCCG and DCG operating segments.PC Client GroupThe revenue and operating income for the PCCG operating segment for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2013 2012 2011Net revenue $33,039 $34,504 $35,624Operating income $11,827 $13,106 $14,840Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.5 billion, or 4%, in 2013 compared to 2012. PCCG platform unit sales were down 3% primarily on softness in traditional PC demand during the first nine months of the year. The decrease in revenue was driven by lower notebook and desktop platform unit sales which were down 4% and 2%, respectively. PCCG platform average selling prices were flat, with 6% higher desktop platform average selling prices offset by 4% lower notebook platform average selling prices. Operating income decreased by $1.3 billion, or 10%, in 2013 compared to 2012, which was driven by $1.5 billion of lower gross margin, partially offset by $200 million of lower operating expenses. The decrease in gross margin was driven by $1.5 billion of higher factory start-up costs primarily on our next-generation 14nm process technology as well as lower PCCG platform revenue. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $520 million of lower PCCG platform unit costs, $260 million of lower excess capacity charges, and higher sell-through of previously non-qualified units. Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.1 billion, or 3%, in 2012 compared to 2011. PCCG revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with PCs for consumer sales. Platform average selling prices and unit sales decreased 2% and 1%, respectively. The decrease was driven by 6% lower notebook platform average selling prices and 5% lower desktop platform unit sales. These decreases were partially offset by a 4% increase in desktop platform average selling prices and a 2% increase in notebook platform unit sales.35Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Operating income decreased by $1.7 billion, or 12%, in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by $644 million of lower gross margin and $1.1 billion of higher operating expenses. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower platform revenue. Additionally, $457 million of higher excess capacity charges and approximately $350 million of higher platform unit costs contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by $785 million of lower factory start-up costs as we transition from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 22nm process technology to R&D of our next-generation 14nm process technology. Additionally, the first half of 2011 included $422 million of charges recorded to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by the design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family.Data Center GroupThe revenue and operating income for the DCG operating segment for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2013 2012 2011Net revenue $11,238 $10,511 $9,911Operating income $5,164 $5,020 $5,053Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $727 million, or 7%, in 2013 compared to 2012. DCG platform average selling prices and unit sales were up 4% and 3%, respectively. Our platform unit sales continued to benefit from growth in the Internet cloud computing and high performance computing market segments.Operating income increased $144 million, or 3%, in 2013 compared to 2012 with $148 million of higher gross margin offset by higher operating expenses. Gross margin was positively impacted by higher platform revenue, partially offset by $274 million of higher factory start-up costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology, and approximately $190 million of higher DCG platform unit costs. Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $600 million, or 6%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase in revenue was due to 6% higher platform average selling prices, slightly offset by 1% lower platform unit sales. Our platform average selling prices benefited from significant growth in the Internet cloud computing and high performance computing market segments. This was offset by weakness in the enterprise server market segment.Operating income decreased by $33 million in 2012 compared to 2011 as $356 million of higher gross margin was more than offset by $389 million of higher operating expenses. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue.Other Intel Architecture Operating SegmentsThe revenue and operating income (loss) for the other Intel architecture operating segments, including ISG, Multi-Comm, the Tablet Group, the Phone Group, the Service Provider Group, the Netbook Group, and the New Devices Group for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2013 2012 2011Net revenue $4,092 $4,378 $5,005Operating income (loss) $(2,445) $(1,377) $(577)Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $286 million, or 7%, in 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily due to lower netbook platform, feature and entry phone components, and Multi-Comm unit sales. To a lesser extent, lower Multi-Comm average selling prices contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG revenue on increased platform average selling prices. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $1.1 billion in 2013 compared to 2012. The decline in operating results was primarily due to approximately $590 million of higher operating expenses in the Other IA operating segments on R&D investments in our smartphone and tablet products as well as higher cost of sales as we ramp our tablet business. Additionally, lower netbook platform and Multi-Comm revenue contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG revenue. 36Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $627 million, or 13%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower netbook platform unit sales and lower Multi-Comm average selling prices. To a lesser extent, lower netbook platform average selling prices contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG platform average selling prices.Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $800 million from an operating loss of $577 million in 2011 to an operating loss of $1.4 billion in 2012. The decline in operating results was primarily due to lower netbook revenue and higher operating expenses in the Other IA operating segments. To a lesser extent, lower Multi-Comm revenue contributed to the decrease.Software and Services Operating SegmentsThe revenue and operating income (loss) for the SSG operating segments, including McAfee, the Wind River Software Group, and the Software and Services Group, for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2013 2012 2011Net revenue $2,502 $2,381 $1,870Operating income (loss) $1 $(11) $(32)Net revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $121 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher McAfee revenue.The operating results for the SSG operating segments increased by $12 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher McAfee revenue, partially offset by higher McAfee operating expenses.Net revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $511 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to two months of incremental revenue from McAfee of $469 million. McAfee was acquired on February 28, 2011.The operating results for the SSG operating segments increased by $21 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher McAfee revenue, partially offset by higher McAfee operating expenses.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for each period were as follows:(Dollars In Millions) 2013 2012 2011Research and development (R&D) $10,611 $10,148 $8,350Marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) $8,088 $8,057 $7,670R&D and MG&A as percentage of net revenue 35% 34% 30%Restructuring and asset impairment charges $240 $— $—Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles $291 $308 $260Research and Development. R&D spending increased by $463 million, or 5%, in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was driven by higher investments in our products, primarily smartphones and tablets, as well higher compensation expenses due to annual salary increases. This increase was partially offset by lower process development costs as we transitioned from R&D to manufacturing for our 14nm process technology.R&D spending increased by $1.8 billion, or 22%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was driven by investments in our products for smartphones, tablets, Ultrabook devices, and data centers. Additionally, R&D spending increased due to higher process development costs for our 14nm process technology, higher compensation expenses mainly due to annual salary increases, additional expenses for acquisitions made in Q1 2011, and higher costs related to the development of 450mm wafer technology.Marketing, General and Administrative. MG&A expenses increased by $31 million in 2013 compared to 2012, and increased by $387 million, or 5%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to two additional months of McAfee expenses in 2012 and higher compensation expenses, due to annual salary increases as well as an increase in the number of employees.37Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. In response to the current business environment, during 2013, management approved several restructuring actions including targeted workforce reductions as well as exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions include the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Massachusetts, which we expect to cease production by the end of 2014. These targeted reductions will enable the company to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the changing market. Restructuring and asset impairment charges for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2013 2012 2011Employee severance and benefit arrangements $201 $— $—Asset impairments 39 — —Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $240 $— $—The restructuring and asset impairment activity for 2013 was as follows: (In Millions) Employee Severance and Benefits Asset Impairments TotalAccrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2012 $— $— $—Additional accruals 195 39 234Adjustments 6 — 6Cash payments (18) — (18)Non-cash settlements — (39) (39)Accrued restructuring balance as of December 28, 2013 $183 $— $183We recorded the additional accruals and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income within the “all other” operating segment. The charges incurred during 2013 include $201 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements, which impacted approximately 3,900 employees. The accrued restructuring balance as of December 28, 2013, relates to employee severance and benefits which are expected to be paid within the next 12 months and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $400 million, which will be realized within R&D, cost of sales, and MG&A. We began to realize these savings in Q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings by Q1 2015. We may incur additional charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements, as well as facility-related or other exit activities, as we continue to align our resources to meet the needs of the business.Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased by $17 million, or 6%, in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased by $48 million, or 18%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the full year of amortization of intangibles in 2012 related to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon, both completed in Q1 2011. For further information, see “Note 8: Acquisitions” and “Note 11: Identified Intangible Assets” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.38Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Share-Based CompensationShare-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion in 2013 ($1.1 billion in 2012 and $1.1 billion in 2011). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses.As of December 28, 2013, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows:(Dollars in Millions) UnrecognizedShare-BasedCompensationCosts WeightedAveragePeriodStock options $75 1.1 yearsRestricted stock units $1,625 1.2 yearsAs of December 28, 2013, there was $13 million in unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to the rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months.Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and OtherGains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other, net for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2013 2012 2011Gains (losses) on equity investments, net $471 $141 $112Interest and other, net $(151) $94 $192We recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher gains on sales of equity investments, partially offset by lower gains on third-party merger transactions. Net gains on equity investments were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower equity method losses and higher gains on third-party merger transactions, partially offset by lower gains on sales of equity investments.Net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of $439 million on the sales of our interest in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) and our shares in Clearwire Corporation in Q3 2013. For further information on these transactions, see ""Note 5: Cash and Investments"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net gains on equity investments for 2011 included a gain of $150 million on the sale of shares in VMware, Inc. Our share of equity method investee losses recognized in 2011 was primarily related to Clearwire LLC ($145 million) and these losses reduced our carrying value in Clearwire LLC to zero.We recognized an interest and other net loss in 2013 compared to a net gain in 2012. We recognized a net loss in 2013 due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of our $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in Q4 2012. Additionally, in Q2 2012 we received proceeds from an insurance claim related to the floods in Thailand.Interest and other, net decreased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a $164 million gain recognized upon formation of the Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC (Care Innovations) joint venture in Q1 2011 and higher interest expense in 2012. 39Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Provision for TaxesOur provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows:(Dollars in Millions) 2013 2012 2011Income before taxes $12,611 $14,873 $17,781Provision for taxes $2,991 $3,868 $4,839Effective tax rate 23.7% 26.0% 27.2%The U.S. R&D tax credit was reenacted in January 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. The majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by the recognition of the 2012 U.S R&D tax credit in Q1 2013. The effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the recognition of the 2013 impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit, partially offset by a lower percentage of our profits generated in lower tax jurisdictions in 2013 compared to 2012.We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2012 compared to 2011, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2012. This impact was partially offset by the U.S. R&D tax credit that was not reinstated during 2012.Liquidity and Capital Resources(Dollars in Millions) Dec 28, 2013 Dec 29, 2012Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets $20,087 $18,162Other long-term investments, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months $1,873 $543Short-term and long-term debt $13,446 $13,448Debt as percentage of stockholders’ equity 23.1% 26.3%40Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) 41Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2013 2012 2011Net cash provided by operating activities $20,776 $18,884 $20,963Net cash used for investing activities (18,073) (14,060) (10,301)Net cash used for financing activities (5,498) (1,408) (11,100)Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents (9) (3) 5Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $(2,804) $3,413 $(433)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.For 2013 compared to 2012, the $1.9 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income in 2013. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2013 compared to 2012 were $1.1 billion lower due to lower income before taxes in 2013 and 2012 income tax overpayments.Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2013, compared to December 29, 2012, included lower income taxes payable and receivable resulting from a reduction in taxes due in 2013, and lower inventories due to the sell-through of older-generation products, partially offset by the ramp of 4th generation Intel Core Processor family products.For 2013, our three largest customers accounted for 44% of our net revenue (43% in 2012 and 2011), with Hewlett-Packard Company accounting for 17% of our net revenue (18% in 2012 and 19% in 2011), Dell accounting for 15% of our net revenue (14% in 2012 and 15% in 2011), and Lenovo accounting for 12% of our net revenue (11% in 2012 and 9% in 2011). These three customers accounted for 34% of our accounts receivable as of December 28, 2013 (33% as of December 29, 2012).For 2012 compared to 2011, the $2.1 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to lower net income and changes in our working capital, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items. The adjustments for noncash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2012 compared to 2011, partially offset by increases in non-acquisition-related deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2011.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as cash used for acquisitions.The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in maturities and sales of trading assets, partially offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in purchases of licensed technology and patents. Our capital expenditures were $10.7 billion in 2013 ($11.0 billion in 2012 and $10.8 billion in 2011).Cash used for investing activities increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in 2012, as compared to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in 2011, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions. Net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2012 included our purchase of $3.2 billion of equity securities in ASML in Q3 2012. Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans.42Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2012 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program in 2013. We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in October 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $45 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. During 2013, we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to $4.8 billion in 2012. As of December 28, 2013, $3.2 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $1.6 billion in 2013 compared to $2.1 billion in 2012. Our total dividend payments were $4.5 billion in 2013 compared to $4.4 billion in 2012. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 85 quarters. In January 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share for Q1 2014. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2014 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2014.The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011, was primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of a higher amount of long-term debt in 2012 compared to 2011.LiquidityCash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 28, 2013, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $20.1 billion ($18.2 billion as of December 29, 2012). In addition to the $20.1 billion, we have $1.9 billion in other long-term investments, and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. Most of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better.Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2013 were $300 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 28, 2013. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s as of December 28, 2013. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. In 2012, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale of these notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program. For further information on the terms of the notes, see “Note 16: Borrowings” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.As of December 28, 2013, $11.3 billion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $11.3 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, approximately $2.1 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of December 28, 2013. The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the U.S. and future acquisitions of non-U.S. entities. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the U.S. and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., such amounts would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.43Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see “Fair Value” in “Note 2: Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Marketable Debt InstrumentsAs of December 28, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $20.3 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $7.2 billion was classified as Level 1, $13.0 billion as Level 2, and $59 million as Level 3.Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.Of the $13.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 60% was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 40% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3, are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.Loans Receivable and Reverse Repurchase AgreementsAs of December 28, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $805 million of loans receivable and $400 million of reverse repurchase agreements. All of these investments were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.Marketable Equity SecuritiesAs of December 28, 2013, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.2 billion of marketable equity securities. All of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.44Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 28, 2013: Payments Due by Period(In Millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years More Than5 YearsOperating lease obligations $870 $208 $298 $166 $198Capital purchase obligations1 5,503 5,375 125 — 3Other purchase obligations and commitments2 1,859 772 744 307 36Long-term debt obligations3 22,372 429 2,360 3,761 15,822Other long-term liabilities4, 5 1,496 569 663 144 120Total6 $32,100 $7,353 $4,190 $4,378 $16,1791 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 28, 2013, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies.3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $188 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes.5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $62 million to be made during 2014 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2014 are not practicable to estimate.6 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services, included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table, include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.45Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding/payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and EUV lithography. Intel agreed to provide R&D funding totaling €829 million over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately €738 million, or $1.0 billion, as of December 28, 2013. As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have not included this obligation in the preceding table. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 28, 2013, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.46Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are affected by changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of the potential changes presented below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 28, 2013, and December 29, 2012. Actual results may differ materially.Currency Exchange RatesIn general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments.Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. For further information, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $40 million as of December 28, 2013 (less than $80 million as of December 29, 2012).Interest RatesWe generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments.We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness. Our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA Corporation. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2013 (an increase of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 29, 2012). A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $10 million as of December 28, 2013 (an increase of approximately $10 million as of December 29, 2012). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see “Note 4: Fair Value” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Equity PricesOur investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of the investment. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities.47Table of ContentsAs of December 28, 2013, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $6.3 billion ($4.4 billion as of December 29, 2012). Our marketable equity investment in ASML was carried at a total fair market value of $5.9 billion, or 94% of our marketable equity portfolio, as of December 28, 2013. Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 25% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $1.6 billion, based on the value as of December 28, 2013 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.6 billion, based on the value as of December 29, 2012 using an assumed loss of 35%).Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $1.3 billion as of December 28, 2013 ($1.2 billion as of December 29, 2012). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.0 billion as of December 28, 2013 ($1.0 billion as of December 29, 2012). The majority of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 28, 2013, was concentrated in our IMFT investment of $646 million ($642 million as of December 29, 2012).48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:53:11.540889

Words such as ""anticipates,"" ""expects,"" ""intends,"" ""goals,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""seeks,"" ""estimates,"" ""continues,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in ""Risk Factors"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 13, 2015.OverviewOur results of operations for each period were as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dec 27, 2014 Dec 28, 2013 Change Dec 27, 2014 Dec 28, 2013 ChangeNet revenue $14,721 $13,834 $887 $55,870 $52,708 $3,162Gross margin $9,621 $8,571 $1,050 $35,609 $31,521 $4,088Gross margin percentage 65.4% 62.0% 3.4% 63.7% 59.8% 3.9%Operating income $4,453 $3,549 $904 $15,347 $12,291 $3,056Net income $3,661 $2,625 $1,036 $11,704 $9,620 $2,084Diluted earnings per share of common stock $0.74 $0.51 $0.23 $2.31 $1.89 $0.42Our results for Q4 2014 were a strong finish to a great year. We achieved record net revenue of $14.7 billion, up 6% from Q4 2013. We achieved increased net revenue and unit sales growth in the PCCG segment, with net revenue up 3% and operating profit up 18% from Q4 2013. DCG achieved 25% net revenue growth and 39% operating income growth from Q4 2013. We saw a moderate increase in net inventory levels from Q3 2014 as we are efficiently managing capacity while ramping our 5th generation Intel Core processor family on 14nm, code-named ""Broadwell."" The worldwide PC supply chain appears to be healthy, with inventory levels appropriate as we enter Q1 2015. Gross margin improved by approximately three and a half percentage points from Q4 2013. The increase from Q4 2013 was primarily due to lower factory start-up costs, lower PCCG and DCG platform (Platform) unit costs, higher Platform average selling prices, and higher Platform unit sales. These items were partially offset by the impact of higher cash consideration associated with our tablet platform and higher production costs on our 14nm products treated as period charges.31Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)For full year 2014, we achieved record net revenue of $55.9 billion, up 6% from 2013, operating income of $15.3 billion, up 25% from 2013, and diluted earnings per share of $2.31, up 22% from 2013. Both our PCCG and DCG businesses outperformed our expectations for the year. PCCG net revenue was up 4%, with PCCG platform unit sales up 8% primarily on higher notebook platform unit sales. We saw robust growth in DCG, with net revenue up 18% and platform average selling prices and unit sales up 10% and 8%, respectively. Gross margin of approximately 64% was up approximately four points from 2013 driven by lower Platform unit costs, lower start-up costs, and higher Platform volumes. These increases were partially offset by higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales and cash consideration provided to our customers associated with integrating our tablet platform.In 2014, we started growing again across a broad range of products and markets by introducing many new product technologies across all of our businesses. We began shipping the world's first processor on 14nm process technology. Additionally, we launched a new family of processors, Intel Core M. Intel Core M processor is enabling new designs and form factors with its full core performance in both compute and graphics. We recently launched Intel RealSense technology, which includes software and depth cameras that enable more natural and intuitive interaction with personal computing devices. In the wireless business, we qualified our first SoC application processor and baseband 3G solution, code-named ""SoFIA."" We also exceeded our goal of 40 million tablet platform unit sales in 2014.The cash generation from our business remained strong, with cash from operations of $20.4 billion in 2014. We ended the year with an investment portfolio of $14.1 billion, down approximately $6.0 billion from a year ago. Our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. We purchased $10.1 billion in capital assets, down from our prior outlook of $11.0 billion as we found efficiencies, optimized our manufacturing network, and increased our factory utilization. In addition, we returned $4.4 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased $10.8 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. Our Board of Directors authorized an increase of $20 billion to the common stock repurchase program. Effective in Q1 2015, our annual dividend increased to $0.96 per share and our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock.Looking ahead to 2015, we are forecasting revenue to grow in the mid-single digits and the midpoint of our gross margin range to be at 62% plus or minus a couple of points. Additionally, we are forecasting R&D and MG&A spending to be approximately $20.0 billion plus or minus $400 million and forecasting capital spending of $10.0 billion plus or minus $500 million. For Q1 2015, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range to be $13.7 billion plus or minus $500 million, down approximately 7% from Q4 2014. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter. We are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 60% plus or minus a couple of points. Our Business Outlook for Q1 2015 and full year 2015 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (R&D plus MG&A), and capital expenditures. We publish our Business Outlook in our quarterly earnings release.Our Business Outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our Investor Relations website, www.intc.com. This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K. The statements in the Business Outlook and forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. The forward-looking statements in the Business Outlook will be effective through the close of business on March 13, 2015, unless updated earlier. From the close of business on March 13, 2015, until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for April 14, 2015, we will observe a ""quiet period."" During the quiet period, the Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 15, 2015, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our Business Outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.32Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Critical Accounting EstimatesThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include:•the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments;•the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and•the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment.In the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.Non-Marketable Equity InvestmentsWe regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $3.2 billion as of December 27, 2014 ($2.3 billion as of December 28, 2013).Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success depends on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see ""Risk Factors"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding our investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects, the technological feasibility of our investee’s products and technologies, the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory or economic changes, and the management and governance structure of the investee. Quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as revenue, earnings, comparable performance multiples, recent financing rounds, the terms of the investees’ issued interests, and the level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $140 million in 2014 ($112 million in 2013 and $104 million in 2012).33Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Long-Lived AssetsProperty, Plant and EquipmentWe assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized.Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. Based on our analysis, impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property, plant and equipment was $115 million in 2014 ($172 million in 2013 and $73 million in 2012).GoodwillGoodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in ""Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit’s fair value. For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference.34Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following assumptions and inputs: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. These estimates are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt.For the annual impairment assessment in 2014, we determined that for each of our reporting units, it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for any reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we have completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.Identified IntangiblesWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment assessment, we recognized impairment charges of $36 million in 2014 ($17 million in 2013 and $21 million in 2012).Income TaxesWe must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not more likely than not, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes.35Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.We have not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on certain undistributed non-U.S. earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in the various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.InventoryIntel has a product development lifecycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities, and associated costs, change in nature from R&D to cost of sales. In order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as product release qualification (PRQ). We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. To determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were zero in 2014 ($319 million in 2013 and $540 million in 2012).Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, customer acceptance of our products, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. If the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value, we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales. Inventory reserves increased by approximately $290 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was driven primarily by higher production costs on 14nm treated as period charges and pre-qualification product costs. These increases were partially offset by the sell-through of written-down inventory and previously non-qualified units.The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The demand forecast is utilized in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.36Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

PCCG and DCG platform unit sales increased by 8%, driven by strength in the traditional PC business and the data center market segments. To a lesser extent, higher Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue and higher IOTG platform unit sales contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by higher cash consideration to our customers associated with integrating our tablet platform and lower MCG phone component unit sales.Our overall gross margin dollars for 2014 increased by $4.1 billion, or 13%, compared to 2013. This increase was due primarily to higher PCCG and DCG platform revenue. To a lesser extent, approximately $1.5 billion of lower PCCG and DCG platform unit costs and approximately $860 million of lower factory start-up costs, primarily driven by our next-generation 14nm process technology, also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by approximately $660 million of higher cash consideration provided to customers associated with integrating our tablet platform and higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales.Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 63.7% in 2014 from 59.8% in 2013. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin increase in PCCG and DCG. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars for 2014 and 2013 from the sale of platforms in the PCCG and DCG operating segments.37Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Our net revenue for 2013 decreased by $633 million, or 1%, compared to 2012. PCCG and DCG platform unit sales decreased by 3%. Additionally, lower MCG phone component revenue and netbook platform revenue contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher PCCG and DCG platform average selling prices, which were up 3%. To a lesser extent, higher IOTG platform average selling prices and higher Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue offset the decrease in revenue.Our overall gross margin dollars for 2013 decreased by $1.6 billion, or 5%, compared to 2012. The decrease was due in large part to $1.8 billion of higher factory start-up costs, primarily for our next-generation 14nm process technology. To a lesser extent, lower MCG phone components revenue and lower netbook platform revenue contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $320 million of lower PCCG and DCG platform unit costs and $220 million of lower excess capacity charges.Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 59.8% in 2013 from 62.1% in 2012. The decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in PCCG. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2013 and 2012 from the sale of platforms in the PCCG and DCG operating segments.PC Client GroupThe revenue and operating income for the PCCG operating segment for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2014 2013 2012Net revenue $34,669 $33,270 $34,688Operating income $14,635 $11,751 $13,008Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $1.4 billion, or 4%, in 2014 compared to 2013.

To a lesser extent, higher desktop platform unit sales of 3% and higher desktop platform average selling prices of 2% also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by lower notebook platform average selling prices of 7%.Operating income increased by $2.9 billion, or 25%, in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by $2.8 billion of higher gross margin and $109 million of lower operating expenses. The increase in gross margin was driven by approximately $1.2 billion of lower PCCG platform unit costs, approximately $930 million of lower factory start-up costs primarily driven by our next-generation 14nm process technology, and higher PCCG platform revenue. Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.4 billion, or 4%, in 2013 compared to 2012. PCCG platform unit sales were down 3%, primarily on softness in the traditional PC business during the first nine months of the year. The decrease in revenue was driven by lower notebook and desktop platform unit sales, which were down 4% and 2%, respectively. PCCG platform average selling prices were flat, with 6% higher desktop platform average selling prices offset by 4% lower notebook platform average selling prices. Operating income decreased by $1.3 billion, or 10%, in 2013 compared to 2012, driven by $1.5 billion of lower gross margin, partially offset by $234 million of lower operating expenses. The decrease in gross margin was driven by $1.5 billion of higher factory start-up costs, primarily on our next-generation 14nm process technology, as well as lower PCCG platform revenue. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $520 million of lower PCCG platform unit costs, $260 million of lower excess capacity charges, and higher sell-through of previously non-qualified units. 38Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Data Center GroupThe revenue and operating income for the DCG operating segment for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2014 2013 2012Net revenue $14,387 $12,161 $11,219Operating income $7,279 $5,569 $5,231Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $2.2 billion, or 18%, in 2014 compared to 2013.

This decrease was primarily due to higher cash consideration to our customers associated with integrating our tablet and phone platforms and lower phone component unit sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher tablet platform unit sales.39Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Operating loss for the MCG operating segment increased by $1.1 billion, or 34%, in 2014 compared to 2013, with $1.2 billion of lower gross margin and $179 million of lower operating expenses. The operating loss increased primarily due to higher cash consideration provided to customers, higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales, and lower phone components revenue. These decreases were partially offset by lower tablet unit costs.Net revenue for the MCG operating segment decreased by $416 million, or 23%, in 2013 compared to 2012. This decrease was primarily due to lower phone component unit sales and average selling prices.Operating loss increased by $1.4 billion, or 77%, in 2013 compared to 2012, driven by $737 million of lower gross margin and $635 million of higher operating expenses on R&D investments in our smartphone and tablet products as well as higher cost of sales as we ramp our tablet business. Lower phone components revenue also contributed to the increase in operating loss.Software and Services Operating SegmentsThe revenue and operating income (loss) for the SSG operating segments, including McAfee and the Software and Services Group, for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2014 2013 2012Net revenue $2,216 $2,190 $2,072Operating income (loss) $55 $24 $12Net revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $26 million in 2014 compared to 2013.The operating results for the SSG operating segments increased by $31 million in 2014 compared to 2013.Net revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $118 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher McAfee revenue.The operating results for the SSG operating segments increased by $12 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily driven by higher McAfee revenue, partially offset by higher McAfee operating expenses.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses for each period were as follows:(Dollars In Millions) 2014 2013 2012Research and development (R&D) $11,537 $10,611 $10,148Marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) $8,136 $8,088 $8,057R&D and MG&A as percentage of net revenue 35% 35% 34%Restructuring and asset impairment charges $295 $240 $—Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles $294 $291 $308Research and Development. R&D spending increased by $926 million, or 9%, in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was due to higher process development costs for our 10nm process technology, higher compensation expenses for both profit-dependent compensation and annual salary increases, as well as higher investments in our products, primarily server and new devices. This increase was partially offset by lower product investments in our smartphone, tablet, and Intel Media businesses.R&D spending increased by $463 million, or 5%, in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was driven by higher investments in our products, primarily smartphones and tablets, as well as higher compensation expenses due to annual salary increases. This increase was partially offset by lower process development costs as we transitioned from R&D to manufacturing for our 14nm process technology.Marketing, General and Administrative. MG&A expenses increased by $48 million, or 1%, in 2014 compared to 2013. MG&A expenses increased by $31 million in 2013 compared to 2012.40Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. Beginning in Q3 2013, management approved several restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions include the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Massachusetts, which we expect to cease production in Q1 2015, and the closure of our assembly and test facility in Costa Rica, which ceased production in Q4 2014. These targeted reductions will enable the company to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the current business environment. We expect these actions to be substantially complete by the end of 2015.Restructuring and asset impairment charges for each period were as follows:(In Millions) 2014 2013 2012Employee severance and benefit arrangements $265 $201 $—Asset impairments and other restructuring charges 30 39 —Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $295 $240 $—Restructuring and asset impairment activity for each period was as follows: (In Millions) Employee Severance and Benefits Asset Impairments and Other TotalAccrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2012 $— $— $—Additional accruals 195 39 234Adjustments 6 — 6Cash payments (18) — (18)Non-cash settlements — (39) (39)Accrued restructuring balance as of December 28, 2013 183 — 183Additional accruals 252 31 283Adjustments 13 (1) 12Cash payments (327) (6) (333)Non-cash settlements — (13) (13)Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2014 $121 $11 $132We recorded the additional accruals and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income and within the ""all other"" operating segments category. A majority of the accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2014 is expected to be paid within the next 12 months and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets. Restructuring actions that were approved in 2014 impacted approximately 3,700 employees. Since Q3 2013, we have incurred a total of $535 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges. These charges included a total of $466 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 7,600 employees, and $69 million in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges. We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $600 million, which will be realized within R&D, cost of sales, and MG&A. We began to realize these savings in Q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings beginning in Q2 2015. 41Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Share-Based CompensationShare-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion in 2014 ($1.1 billion in 2013 and $1.1 billion in 2012). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses.As of December 27, 2014, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows:(Dollars in Millions) UnrecognizedShare-BasedCompensationCosts WeightedAveragePeriodRestricted stock units $1,795 1.3 yearsStock options $34 11 monthsAs of December 27, 2014, there was $13 million in unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire shares of common stock under our stock purchase plan.

The majority of gains on sales, net for 2014 resulted from gains on private equity sales.We recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher gains on sales of equity investments, partially offset by lower gains on third-party merger transactions. Net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of $439 million on the sales of our interest in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) and our shares in Clearwire Corporation in Q3 2013. For further information on these transactions, see ""Note 5: Cash and Investments"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.We recognized an interest and other net gain in 2014 compared to a net loss in 2013 due to a gain recognized on the divestiture of our Intel Media assets in 2014. For further information, see ""Note 9: Divestitures"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We recognized an interest and other net loss in 2013 compared to a net gain in 2012. We recognized a net loss in 2013 due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of our $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in Q4 2012. Additionally, in Q2 2012 we received proceeds from an insurance claim related to the floods in Thailand.Provision for TaxesOur provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows:(Dollars in Millions) 2014 2013 2012Income before taxes $15,801 $12,611 $14,873Provision for taxes $4,097 $2,991 $3,868Effective tax rate 25.9% 23.7% 26.0%The U.S. R&D tax credit was reenacted in Q4 2014 retroactive for the full year. It was also reenacted in Q1 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. A substantial majority of the increase in our effective tax rate between 2014 and 2013 was driven by the reenacted U.S. R&D tax credit in 2013 containing two years' worth of R&D tax credits. The majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate between 2013 and 2012 was driven by the recognition of the 2012 U.S. R&D tax credit in Q1 2013. This was partially offset by a lower percentage of our profits generated in lower tax jurisdictions in 2013 compared to 2012.42Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Liquidity and Capital Resources(Dollars in Millions) Dec 27, 2014 Dec 28, 2013Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets $14,054 $20,087Other long-term investments $2,023 $1,473Loans receivable and other $1,285 $1,226Reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months $450 $400Short-term and long-term debt $13,711 $13,446Temporary equity $912 $—Debt as percentage of permanent stockholders’ equity 24.5% 23.1%Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions)In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:43Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)(In Millions) 2014 2013 2012Net cash provided by operating activities $20,418 $20,776 $18,884Net cash used for investing activities (9,905) (18,073) (14,060)Net cash used for financing activities (13,611) (5,498) (1,408)Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents (15) (9) (3)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $(3,113) $(2,804) $3,41344Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.For 2014 compared to 2013, the $358 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net income and adjustments for non-cash items. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2014 compared to 2013. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2014 compared to 2013 were $1.8 billion higher due to higher income before taxes in 2014 and 2012 income tax overpayments, which reduced income taxes paid in 2013.Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 27, 2014, compared to December 28, 2013, included an income taxes net receivable resulting from income tax settlement payments in 2014 and higher accounts receivable resulting from a higher portion of sales at the end of Q4 2014. For 2014, our three largest customers accounted for 46% of our net revenue (44% in 2013 and 43% in 2012), with HP accounting for 18% of our net revenue (17% in 2013 and 18% in 2012), Dell accounting for 16% of our net revenue (15% in 2013 and 14% in 2012), and Lenovo accounting for 12% of our net revenue (12% in 2013 and 11% in 2012). These three customers accounted for 43% of our accounts receivable as of December 27, 2014 (34% as of December 28, 2013).For 2013 compared to 2012, the $1.9 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income in 2013.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions.The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets,higher maturities, and sales of our available-for-sale investments. This activity was partially offset by an increase in investments in non-marketable equity investments and lower maturities and sales of trading assets. Our capital expenditures were $10.1 billion in 2014 ($10.7 billion in 2013 and $11.0 billion in 2012).Cash used for investing activities increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in purchases of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in maturities and sales of trading assets, partially offset by an increase in maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and a decrease in purchases of licensed technology and patents. Net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2012 included our purchase of $3.2 billion of equity securities in ASML in Q3 2012. Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program partially offset by the issuance of short-term debt in 2014. We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $65 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. This amount includes an increase of $20 billion in the authorization limit approved by our Board of Directors in July 2014. During 2014, we repurchased $10.8 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to $2.1 billion in 2013. As of December 27, 2014, $12.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled $1.7 billion in 2014 compared to $1.6 billion in 2013. Our total dividend payments were $4.4 billion in 2014 compared to $4.5 billion in 2013. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 89 quarters. In January 2015, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock for Q1 2015. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2015 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2015.45Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2012 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program in 2013.LiquidityCash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 27, 2014, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $14.1 billion ($20.1 billion as of December 28, 2013). In addition to the $14.1 billion, we have $2.0 billion of other long-term investments, $1.3 billion of loans receivable and other, and $450 million of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. Most of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better.Another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion. This ongoing authorization includes borrowings under our commercial paper program. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $2.4 billion during 2014, and $500 million of commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 27, 2014. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s as of December 27, 2014. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. In 2012, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale of these notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repurchase common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program. For further information on the terms of the notes, see ""Note 15: Borrowings"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.As of December 27, 2014, $12.0 billion of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $12.0 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, approximately $2.3 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of December 27, 2014. The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the U.S. and future acquisitions of non-U.S. entities. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the U.S., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., such amounts would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, working capital requirements, dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.46Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see ""Fair Value"" in ""Note 2: Accounting Policies"" and ""Note 4: Fair Value"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Marketable Debt InstrumentsAs of December 27, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $15.0 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $6.9 billion was classified as Level 1, $8.0 billion as Level 2, and $106 million as Level 3.Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active.Of the $8.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 40% was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 60% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.Loans Receivable and Reverse Repurchase AgreementsAs of December 27, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $721 million of loans receivable and $268 million of reverse repurchase agreements. All of these investments were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.Marketable Equity SecuritiesAs of December 27, 2014, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $7.1 billion of marketable equity securities. All of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.47Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Contractual ObligationsSignificant contractual obligations as of December 27, 2014 were as follows: Payments Due by Period(In Millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years More Than5 YearsOperating lease obligations $1,070 $205 $331 $219 $315Capital purchase obligations1 3,482 3,317 165 — —Other purchase obligations and commitments2 2,500 1,390 1,027 83 —Long-term debt obligations3 21,942 430 5,330 720 15,462Other long-term liabilities4, 5 1,437 780 416 128 113Total6 $30,431 $6,122 $7,269 $1,150 $15,8901 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 27, 2014, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $262 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes.5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $69 million to be made during 2015 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2015 are not practicable to estimate.6 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services, included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table, include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.48Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding or payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. As of December 27, 2014, assuming that all future milestones are met, excluding the ASML milestones subsequently mentioned, the additional required payments would be approximately $450 million. During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of EUV lithography, certain of which were amended in 2014. Under the amended agreements Intel agreed to provide R&D funding totaling €829 million over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately €562 million, or $689 million, as of December 27, 2014. As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from the preceding table.For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for smartphones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have also agreed to invest up to RMB 9.0 billion (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of the holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup, which will own Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics. As our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table.Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 27, 2014, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.49Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are affected by changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange RatesIn general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding gains and losses on the related hedging instruments.Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. For further information, see ""Risk Factors"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $50 million as of December 27, 2014 (less than $40 million as of December 28, 2013).Interest RatesWe generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments.We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness. Our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA Corporation. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014 (an increase of approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2013). A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $10 million as of December 27, 2014 (an increase of approximately $10 million as of December 28, 2013). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see ""Note 4: Fair Value"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Equity PricesOur investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities.50Table of ContentsAs of December 27, 2014, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $7.1 billion ($6.3 billion as of December 28, 2013). Substantially all of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of December 27, 2014 was concentrated in our investment in ASML of $6.9 billion ($5.9 billion as of December 28, 2013). Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of 30% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $2.1 billion, based on the value as of December 27, 2014 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.6 billion, based on the value as of December 28, 2013 using an assumed decline of 25%).Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $1.8 billion as of December 27, 2014 ($1.3 billion as of December 28, 2013). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.4 billion as of December 27, 2014 ($1.0 billion as of December 28, 2013). The majority of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 27, 2014 was concentrated in our IMFT and Cloudera (which was purchased during 2014) investments of $713 million and $280 million, respectively ($646 million for IMFT as of December 28, 2013).Commodity Price RiskAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not materially affected by commodity price risk. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place for our key commodities that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration. For further information on commodity price risk, see ""Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 51Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:53:13.135748

Overview of contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off-balance-sheet arrangements outstanding as of December 26, 2015, including expected payment schedule.The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as ""anticipates,"" ""expects,"" ""intends,"" ""goals,"" ""plans,"" ""believes,"" ""seeks,"" ""estimates,"" ""continues,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in ""Risk Factors"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 12, 2016, except for our acquisition of Altera completed on December 28, 2015 as discussed in “Note 8: Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.OverviewOur results of operations for each period were as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended(Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014 Change Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014 ChangeNet revenue $14,914 $14,721 $193 $55,355 $55,870 $(515)Gross margin $9,590 $9,621 $(31) $34,679 $35,609 $(930)Gross margin percentage 64.3% 65.4% (1.1) pts 62.6% 63.7% (1.1) ptsOperating income $4,299 $4,453 $(154) $14,002 $15,347 $(1,345)Net income $3,613 $3,661 $(48) $11,420 $11,704 $(284)Diluted earnings per share of common stock $0.74 $0.74 $— $2.33 $2.31 $0.02Effective tax rate 16.0% 21.4% (5.4) pts 19.6% 25.9% (6.3) pts32Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)We achieved record net revenue for Q4 2015 of $14.9 billion, up 1% from Q4 2014. We continue to see our business evolve as we execute on our strategy to leverage the ""Virtuous Cycle of Growth"" with higher DCG platform, NSG, and IOTG platform revenue. These operating segments made up nearly 40% of our revenue and more than 60% of our operating profit for full year 2015. DCG and IOTG both posted record net revenue for the quarter and was partially offset by lower CCG platform revenue. We continue to believe that the worldwide PC supply chain is healthy, with appropriate levels of inventory.Gross margin of 64% decreased by approximately one percentage point from Q4 2014, primarily due to higher platform unit costs that resulted in part from a higher mix of 14nm platforms, and lower platform unit sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices and, to a lesser extent, lower factory start-up costs. Gross margin increased approximately two percentage points compared to the midpoint of the Business Outlook in October 2015, primarily driven by lower platform unit costs, lower factory start-up costs, and higher platform average selling prices.For full year 2015, our net revenue of $55.4 billion was down 1% from 2014, operating income of $14.0 billion, was down 9% from 2014, and diluted earnings per share of $2.33 were up 1% from 2014. CCG net revenue was down 8% as we continued to see weakness in the macroeconomic environment and, in particular, the PC market as we were coming off of a strong growth rate in the second half of 2014 with the Microsoft Windows* XP refresh. We continue to see growth in DCG, with net revenue up 11% and platform unit sales and average selling prices up 8% and 3%, respectively.Gross margin of 63% was down approximately one point from 2014, driven by higher platform unit costs on 14nm and lower platform unit sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices, primarily driven by a higher mix of DCG platforms and higher average selling prices on a richer mix of platforms within the desktop and DCG platforms. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross margin was also partially offset by lower factory start-up costs on 14nm as well as lower production costs on 14nm, which were treated as a period charge in 2014. Operating profit was $14.0 billion in 2015, a decrease of $1.3 billion from 2014, driven by lower gross margin and increased investments in our growth market segments of the data center, Internet of Things, and memory. Our operating profit decrease was partially offset by lower investment in the PC market segment. Our effective tax rate for 2015 of 19.6% decreased 6.3 points from 2014, driven by one-time items and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years’ non-U.S. earnings.The cash generation from our business remained strong, with cash from operations of $19.0 billion in 2015. During 2015, we purchased $7.3 billion of capital assets, down $2.8 billion from 2014. This change was primarily driven by our new strategy on next-generation process technology and manufacturing efficiencies, namely that we extended the length of time we plan to use the 14nm process technology by introducing a third 14nm product, code-named ""Kaby Lake."" This product will have key performance enhancements as compared to our 6th generation Intel Core processor family. We also returned cash to stockholders by both paying $4.6 billion in dividends and repurchasing $3.0 billion of common stock through our stock repurchase program. We ended the year with an investment portfolio of $25.3 billion, up approximately $11.3 billion from a year ago. That investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. We issued approximately $9.5 billion of long-term debt to finance our Altera acquisition. For further information, see ""Note 15: Borrowings"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Effective in Q1 2016, our annual dividend increased $0.08 to $1.04 per share and our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock.Early in Q1 2016, we completed the acquisition of Altera. The acquisition will couple Intel’s leading-edge products and manufacturing process with Altera’s leading FPGA technology. The combination is expected to enable new classes of products that meet customer needs in the data center and Internet of Things market segments. We believe our product offerings and architectures will continue to enable innovation and growth in the data center and the Internet of Things market segments. The impact of the Altera acquisition has been reflected in our Business Outlook published in our January 2016 earnings release. For further information, see ""Note 8: Acquisitions"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Our Business Outlook for Q1 2016 and full year 2016 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (R&D plus MG&A), and capital expenditures. We publish our Business Outlook in our quarterly earnings release.33Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Our Business Outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our Investor Relations website, www.intc.com. This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K. The statements in the Business Outlook and forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. The forward-looking statements in the Business Outlook will be effective through the close of business on March 18, 2016, unless updated earlier. From the close of business on March 18, 2016 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for April 19, 2016, we will observe a ""quiet period."" During the quiet period, the Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 14, 2016, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our Business Outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include:•the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments;•the determination of useful lives for our property, plant and equipment and the related timing of when depreciation should begin;•the valuation and allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;•the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; identified intangibles and goodwill), which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes;•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and•the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment.In the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved.Non-Marketable Equity InvestmentsWe regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $4.5 billion as of December 26, 2015 ($3.2 billion as of December 27, 2014).Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success depends on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see ""Risk Factors"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.34Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized. The measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment. Qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding each investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; the technological feasibility of our investee’s products and technologies; the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; and the management and governance structure of the investee. Quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as revenue, earnings, comparable performance multiples, recent financing rounds, the terms of investees’ issued interests, and the level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees' revenue, costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $166 million in 2015 ($140 million in 2014 and $112 million in 2013).Property, Plant and Equipment DepreciationManagement judgment is required in determining the estimated economic useful lives of our property, plant and equipment, which can materially impact our depreciation expense. Accordingly, at least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of these assets. During the assessment performed in Q4 2015, we considered factors such as the lengthening of the process technology cadence resulting in longer node transitions on both 14nm and 10nm products. With those longer transitions, we added a third product to our 14nm roadmap. We have also increased re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As a result, we determined that the useful lives of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities should be increased from four to five years. We will account for this as a change in estimate that will be applied prospectively, effective in Q1 2016. This change in depreciable life drives approximately $1.5 billion in lower depreciation expense for 2016. Approximately half of this benefit will increase gross margin (impacting both unit cost and start-up costs), approximately one-fourth will decrease R&D expenses, and the remaining one-fourth will result in lower inventory costs and ending inventory values.As part of our long-range capacity planning, construction on certain facilities is on hold, and the facilities are not in use. These facilities are being held in a safe state, and we have plans to place them into service at a future date. The time at which these assets are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity, market demand for specific products, and where we are in the transition of products on our roadmap. Management is required to make judgments as to the timing of when these facilities will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the manufacturing of our products, which is when depreciation begins. 35Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Business CombinationsAccounting for acquisitions requires our management to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements. The items involving the most significant assumptions, estimates, and judgments include determining the fair value of the following:•Intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future cash flows, and discount rates, as well as the estimated useful life of the intangible assets;•the acquired company’s brand, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used;•deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain tax positions, and tax-related valuation allowances, which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date; •inventory; property, plant and equipment; pre-existing liabilities or legal claims; deferred revenue; and contingent consideration, each as may be applicable, and•goodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.We allocate goodwill and intangible assets to the reporting unit(s) based on the reporting unit(s) that are expected to benefit from the business combination. Upon any reorganization of our operating segments, we reevaluate our reporting units and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year following the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Long-Lived Asset ImpairmentsProperty, Plant and EquipmentWe assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized.Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. Based on our analysis, impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property, plant and equipment totaled $151 million in 2015 ($115 million in 2014 and $172 million in 2013).36Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Identified IntangiblesWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset.The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment assessment, we recognized impairment charges of $7 million in 2015 ($36 million in 2014 and $17 million in 2013).GoodwillGoodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component, and are consistent with the operating segments identified in ""Note 26: Operating Segments and Geographic Information"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. Additionally, as part of this assessment, we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit’s fair value. For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference.Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following assumptions and inputs: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. These estimates are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt.37Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)For the annual impairment assessment in 2015, we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill, it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units. During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.Income TaxesWe must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not more likely than not, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes.We use a two-step process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.We have not recognized U.S. deferred income taxes on certain undistributed non-U.S. earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. Remittances of non-U.S. earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs, as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our non-U.S. and U.S. operations. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital, and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non-U.S. earnings, which would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.InventoryIntel has a product development life cycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities, and associated costs, change in nature from R&D to cost of sales. In order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications. This milestone is known as product release qualification (PRQ). We have identified PRQ as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. To determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were insignificant in 2015 (insignificant in 2014 and $319 million in 2013).38Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, customer acceptance of our products, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost. If the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value, we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales. Inventory reserves increased by approximately $185 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The demand forecast is utilized in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. 39Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Results of OperationsConsolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) December 26, 2015 December 27, 2014 December 28, 2013 Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenueNet revenue $55,355 100.0 % $55,870 100.0% $52,708 100.0 %Cost of sales 20,676 37.4 % 20,261 36.3% 21,187 40.2 %Gross margin 34,679 62.6 % 35,609 63.7% 31,521 59.8 %Research and development 12,128 21.9 % 11,537 20.6% 10,611 20.1 %Marketing, general and administrative 7,930 14.3 % 8,136 14.6% 8,088 15.3 %Restructuring and asset impairment charges 354 0.6 % 295 0.5% 240 0.5 %Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 265 0.5 % 294 0.5% 291 0.6 %Operating income 14,002 25.3 % 15,347 27.5% 12,291 23.3 %Gains (losses) on equity investments, net 315 0.6 % 411 0.7% 471 0.9 %Interest and other, net (105) (0.2)% 43 0.1% (151) (0.3)%Income before taxes 14,212 25.7 % 15,801 28.3% 12,611 23.9 %Provision for taxes 2,792 5.1 % 4,097 7.4% 2,991 5.6 %Net income $11,420 20.6 % $11,704 20.9% $9,620 18.3 %Diluted earnings per share of common stock $2.33 $2.31 $1.89 Our net revenue in 2015 decreased by $515 million, or 1%, compared to 2014. Platform unit sales were down 9% due to challenging macroeconomic conditions, particularly in the first half of the year, and higher PC demand in 2014 driven by the Microsoft Windows XP refresh. The decrease in PC demand was partially offset by higher DCG and IOTG platform unit sales. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher platform average selling prices, which were up 8%, as we benefited from a higher mix of DCG platform unit sales and higher average selling prices on desktop and DCG platforms. To a lesser extent, the decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher NSG revenue.Our overall gross margin percentage was 62.6% in 2015, down from 63.7% in 2014. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin decrease in the CCG operating segment. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars for 2015 and 2014 from the sale of platforms in the CCG and DCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in 2015 decreased by $930 million, or 3%, compared to 2014.

Platform unit sales were up 19%, primarily driven by the ramp of our tablet platform and strength in the traditional PC business. To a lesser extent, higher NSG revenue also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by lower platform average selling prices, which were down 10% primarily on mix shift on significantly higher tablet and phone platform unit sales and cash consideration associated with integrating our tablet and phone platforms. To a lesser extent, lower CCG phone component unit sales partially offset the increase in revenue.Our overall gross margin percentage was 63.7% in 2014, up from 59.8% in 2013. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin increase in the CCG and DCG operating segments.

MG&A expenses increased by $48 million in 2014 compared to 2013.Restructuring and Asset Impairment ChargesRestructuring and asset impairment charges by program for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions) Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014 Dec 28, 20132015 restructuring program $264 $— $—2013 restructuring program 90 295 240Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $354 $295 $2402015 Restructuring Program.

We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $400 million, which will be realized within R&D, cost of sales, and MG&A. We began to realize these savings in Q2 2015 and expect to fully realize these savings after the actions are complete.46Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)2013 Restructuring Program. Beginning in Q3 2013, management approved and commenced implementation of several restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions include the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Massachusetts, which ceased production in Q1 2015, and the closure of our assembly and test facility in Costa Rica, which ceased production in Q4 2014. These targeted reductions will enable us to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the current business environment. This program was substantially complete by the end of 2015.Restructuring and asset impairment charges for the 2013 restructuring program for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions) Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014 Dec 28, 2013Employee severance and benefit arrangements $82 $265 $201Asset impairments and other restructuring charges 8 30 39Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $90 $295 $240Restructuring and asset impairment activities for the 2013 restructuring program for each period were as follows:(In Millions) Employee Severance and Benefits Asset Impairments and Other TotalAccrued restructuring balance as of December 28, 2013 $183 $— $183Additional accruals 252 31 283Adjustments 13 (1) 12Cash payments (327) (6) (333)Non-cash settlements — (13) (13)Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2014 121 11 132Additional accruals 101 9 110Adjustments (19) (1) (20)Cash payments (171) (10) (181)Non-cash settlements — (3) (3)Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2015 $32 $6 $38We recorded the additional accruals and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income and within the ""all other"" operating segments category.

Since Q3 2013, we have incurred a total of $625 million in restructuring and asset impairment charges. These charges include $548 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 8,500 employees, and $77 million in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges. We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $600 million, which will be realized within R&D, MG&A, and cost of sales. We began to realize these savings in Q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings after the actions are complete.47Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Share-Based CompensationShare-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion in 2015 ($1.1 billion in 2014 and $1.1 billion in 2013). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses.As of December 26, 2015, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows:(Dollars in Millions) UnrecognizedShare-BasedCompensationCosts WeightedAveragePeriodRestricted stock units $1,789 1.2 yearsStock options $13 8 monthsStock Purchase Plan $14 2 monthsGains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other, NetGains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other, net for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions) Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014 Dec 28, 2013Gains (losses) on equity investments, net $315 $411 $471Interest and other, net $(105) $43 $(151)We recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments, partially offset by higher gains on third-party merger transactions.We recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments, partially offset by higher gains on third-party merger transactions. The majority of gains on sales, net for 2014 resulted from gains on private equity sales. Net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of $439 million on the sales of our interest in Clearwire Communications, LLC and our shares in Clearwire Corporation in Q3 2013. For further information on these transactions, see ""Note 5: Cash and Investments"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.We recognized an interest and other net loss in 2015 compared to a net gain in 2014 primarily due to higher interest expense, which includes the 2015 issuances of our $9.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. For further information on these transactions, see ""Note 15: Borrowings"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.We recognized an interest and other net gain in 2014 compared to a net loss in 2013 due to a gain recognized on the divestiture of our Intel Media assets in 2014.Provision for TaxesOur provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions) Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014 Dec 28, 2013Income before taxes $14,212 $15,801 $12,611Provision for taxes $2,792 $4,097 $2,991Effective tax rate 19.6% 25.9% 23.7%Most of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by one-time items, a higher proportion of our income from lower tax jurisdictions, and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years’ non-U.S. earnings positively impacted our effective income tax rate.A substantial majority of the increase in our effective tax rate between 2014 and 2013 was driven by the reenacted U.S. R&D tax credit in 2013 containing two years' worth of R&D tax credits. The U.S. R&D tax credit was reenacted in Q4 2014 retroactive for the full year. It was also reenacted in Q1 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012.48Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Liquidity and Capital Resources(Dollars in Millions) Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets $25,313 $14,054Other long-term investments $1,891 $2,023Loans receivable and other $1,170 $1,335Reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months $1,000 $450Unsettled trade liabilities and other $99 $77Short-term and long-term debt $22,670 $13,655Temporary equity $897 $912Debt as percentage of permanent stockholders’ equity 37.1% 24.4%49Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions)In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions) Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014 Dec 28, 2013Net cash provided by operating activities $19,017 $20,418 $20,776Net cash used for investing activities (8,183) (9,905) (18,073)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities 1,912 (13,611) (5,498)Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents 1 (15) (9)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $12,747 $(3,113) $(2,804)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.50Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)For 2015 compared to 2014, the $1.4 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, adjustments for non-cash items, and lower net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were lower due primarily to deferred taxes, partially offset by higher depreciation. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2015 compared to 2014 were $1.2 billion lower due to lower income before taxes in 2015.Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 26, 2015 compared to December 27, 2014 included a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits. This decrease was due to higher profit-dependent compensation in 2014 that was paid out in 2015, and an increase in inventories due primarily to the ramp of our 6th generation Intel Core processor family of products, partially offset by the timing of certain tax benefits that reduced our income taxes payable position in 2015. Hewlett-Packard Company, our largest customer in 2014, separated into HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company on November 1, 2015. In 2015, these entities collectively accounted for 18% of our net revenue (18% in 2014 and 17% in 2013), Dell Inc. accounted for 15% of our net revenue (16% in 2014 and 15% in 2013), and Lenovo Group Limited accounted for 13% of our net revenue (12% in 2014 and 12% in 2013). Combined, these customers accounted for 46% of our net revenue (46% in 2014 and 44% in 2013) and 49% of our accounts receivable as of December 26, 2015 (43% as of December 27, 2014).For 2014 compared to 2013, the $358 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net income and adjustment for non-cash items.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $7.3 billion in 2015 ($10.1 billion in 2014 and $10.7 billion in 2013).The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to net trading assets activity (which was a source of cash in 2015 compared to a use of cash in 2014) and lower capital expenditures. This activity was partially offset by net available-for-sale activity (which was cash flow neutral in 2015 compared to a source of cash in 2014) and higher investments in non-marketable equity investments.The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to net available-for-sale activity (which was a source of cash in 2014 compared to a use of cash in 2013) and a decrease in cash used for net trading assets activity. This activity was partially offset by an increase in investments in non-marketable equity investments.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.Cash was provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014, primarily due to the issuance of $9.5 billion of long-term debt and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sales of common stock through employee equity incentive plans and repayments of short-term debt compared to borrowings in 2014. We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $65.0 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. During 2015, we repurchased $3.0 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $10.8 billion in 2014. As of December 26, 2015, $9.4 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled $866 million in 2015 compared to $1.7 billion in 2014. Our total dividend payments were $4.6 billion in 2015 compared to $4.4 billion in 2014. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 93 quarters. In January 2016, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock for Q1 2016. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2016 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2016.The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program, partially offset by the issuance of short-term debt in 2014. 51Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)LiquidityCash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 26, 2015, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets totaled $25.3 billion ($14.1 billion as of December 27, 2014). The increased balance compared to December 27, 2014 was primarily related to the accumulation of cash consideration required for our acquisition of Altera, which closed on December 28, 2015, subsequent to our fiscal 2015 year-end. In addition to the $25.3 billion, we have $1.9 billion of other long-term investments, $1.2 billion of loans receivable and other, and $1.0 billion of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and a substantial majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better.Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $5.0 billion, which increased in 2015 from $3.0 billion. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were $900 million during 2015, and no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 26, 2015. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s as of December 26, 2015. On December 21, 2015, we entered into a short-term credit facility to borrow up to $5.0 billion to facilitate the settlement of our acquisition of Altera. No borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility as of December 26, 2015 and it was closed in January 2016. In 2015, we issued $9.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. These notes were issued primarily to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our pending acquisition of Altera and for general corporate purposes, which may include the refinancing of existing indebtedness. For further information on the terms of the notes, see ""Note 15: Borrowings"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.As of December 26, 2015, $11.1 billion of our $25.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $11.1 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, approximately $2.6 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of December 26, 2015. The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. This amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the U.S. and future acquisitions of non-U.S. entities. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the U.S., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., such amounts would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.During 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Altera in an all-cash transaction. The transaction closed on December 28, 2015, subsequent to our fiscal 2015 year-end. As of the date we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $16.7 billion. We financed a portion of the acquisition by issuing $9.5 billion in long-term debt during 2015 and borrowing $4.0 billion against our short-term credit facility in the first quarter of 2016. We funded the remainder of the acquisition with issuances of commercial paper and existing cash and investments. For information on our indebtedness, see ""Note 15: Borrowings"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.We believe that we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see ""Fair Value"" in ""Note 2: Accounting Policies"" and ""Note 4: Fair Value"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.52Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Marketable Debt InstrumentsAs of December 26, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $23.4 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $13.2 billion was classified as Level 1, $10.0 billion as Level 2, and $118 million as Level 3.Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical instruments that are traded in active markets. We evaluate instrument-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt instrument is active.Of the $10.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 50% was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us, and approximately 50% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data.Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models, performed either by us or our pricing providers, using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes.Loans Receivable and Reverse Repurchase AgreementsAs of December 26, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $479 million of loans receivable and $2.4 billion of reverse repurchase agreements. All of these investments were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data.Marketable Equity SecuritiesAs of December 26, 2015, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $6.0 billion of marketable equity securities. Substantially all of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period.53Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Contractual ObligationsSignificant contractual obligations as of December 26, 2015 were as follows: Payments Due by Period(In Millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years More Than5 YearsOperating lease obligations $1,200 $234 $376 $264 $326Capital purchase obligations1 5,746 4,250 1,496 — —Other purchase obligations and commitments2 3,966 1,784 1,986 196 —Long-term debt obligations3 38,120 2,299 4,499 3,383 27,939Other long-term liabilities4, 5 1,263 788 214 105 156Total6 $50,295 $9,355 $8,571 $3,948 $28,4211 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $114 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes.5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $68 million to be made during 2016 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2016 are not practicable to estimate.6 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in ""Other purchase obligations and commitments"" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.54Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding or payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty. As of December 26, 2015, assuming that all future milestones are met, excluding the ASML milestones mentioned below, the additional required payments would be approximately $827 million. During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of EUV lithography, certain of which were amended in 2014. Under the amended agreements, Intel agreed to provide R&D funding totaling €829 million over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately €367 million, or $403 million, as of December 26, 2015. As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from the preceding table.For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have also agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of UniSpreadtrum. During 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment. The second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately $500 million; however, as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table.Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 26, 2015, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.55Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are affected by changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 26, 2015, and December 27, 2014. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange RatesIn general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding gains and losses on the related hedging instruments.Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. These programs reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. For further information, see ""Risk Factors"" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $75 million as of December 26, 2015 (less than $50 million as of December 27, 2014).Interest RatesWe generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt investments with interest rate swaps, and we may elect to hedge interest rate risks of our indebtedness. Gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments.We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $15 million as of December 26, 2015 (an increase of approximately $10 million as of December 27, 2014). After taking into account interest rate and currency swaps, a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.6 billion as of December 26, 2015 (an increase of approximately $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014). The increase from December 27, 2014 was primarily driven by the inclusion of $9.5 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in Q3 and Q4 2015. The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see ""Note 4: Fair Value"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Equity PricesOur investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities.56Table of ContentsAs of December 26, 2015, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $6.0 billion ($7.1 billion as of December 27, 2014). Substantially all of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of December 26, 2015 was concentrated in our investment in ASML of $5.7 billion ($6.9 billion as of December 27, 2014). Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of 30% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $1.8 billion, based on the value as of December 26, 2015 (a decrease in value of approximately $2.1 billion, based on the value as of December 27, 2014 using an assumed decline of 30%).Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable cost method equity investments had a carrying amount of $2.9 billion as of December 26, 2015 ($1.8 billion as of December 27, 2014) and included our investment in UniSpreadtrum (which was made in 2015) and Cloudera of $966 million and $454 million, respectively ($454 million for Cloudera as of December 27, 2014). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.6 billion as of December 26, 2015 ($1.4 billion as of December 27, 2014). A majority of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 26, 2015 was concentrated in our IMFT and Cloudera investments of $872 million and $256 million, respectively ($713 million and $280 million for IMFT and Cloudera, respectively, as of December 27, 2014).Commodity Price RiskAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place for our key commodities that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration.

Overview of contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off-balance-sheet arrangements outstanding as of December 31, 2016, including expected payment schedule.28Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Overview (Dollars in Billions, Except Per Share Amounts)29Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)We achieved record revenue of $59.4 billion in 2016, up $4.0 billion, or 7%, from 2015. The increase was driven by the inclusion of PSG and growth in the DCG, CCG, and IOTG businesses. Net income for 2016 was $10.3 billion, and cash flow from operations was $21.8 billion. •CCG revenue was $32.9 billion, up 2%, with platform volume down 10% and platform average selling prices up 11%. DCG revenue was $17.2 billion, up 8%, with platform volume up 8% and platform average selling prices down 1%.•Gross margin dollars were $36.2 billion, up $1.5 billion from 2015. Gross margin of 60.9% was down 1.7 points from 2015. The gross margin percentage point decrease was driven primarily by Altera and other amortization of acquisition-related charges, lower NSG gross margin, higher factory start-up costs (primarily on 10nm), higher product warranty and intellectual property charges, and CCG non-platform products. The decrease was partially offset by lower platform unit costs, platform volume, and higher platform average selling prices.•R&D and MG&A totaled $21.1 billion, up 5% from a year ago. R&D and MG&A were 35.6% of revenue in 2016, down approximately 1 point from 2015.•Restructuring and other charges were $1.9 billion, primarily driven by our 2016 Restructuring Program. •Earnings per share of $2.12 were down 21 cents, or 9% from a year ago. This decrease was primarily driven by higher restructuring and other charges, higher spending, and higher amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The decrease was partially offset by platform volume and higher platform average selling prices.•Record cash flow from operations in 2016 was approximately $21.8 billion. During 2016, we acquired Altera and other smaller acquisitions for $15.5 billion. We purchased $9.6 billion in capital assets, paid $4.9 billion in dividends, and repurchased $2.6 billion in stock. We issued $2.8 billion of long-term debt and assumed $1.5 billion as part of the Altera acquisition.2016 has been a transformative year for Intel. We have made strides to move from a PC centric company to one that is powering the cloud and billions of smart, connected devices. We are building on our strong position in client computing and are investing for growth in the data center, Internet of Things market segments, and disruptive differentiated memory technology. To accelerate our transformation, in Q2 2016, we announced the 2016 Restructuring Program, which is on track to reduce our headcount and generate savings. We are reallocating these savings to our growth segments, such as the data center and Internet of Things, and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership in Moore's Law and expand market opportunities in areas such as memory and autonomous driving. In Q1 2016, we completed the acquisition of Altera, a global semiconductor company that designs and sells programmable semiconductors and related products, and subsequently formed PSG. We have worked to integrate Altera throughout 2016 and the business continues to deliver new products and to grow. In September 2016, to further accelerate our transformation and focus our business on core strategic areas, we announced the planned divestiture of ISecG. Our Business Outlook for Q1 2017 and full year 2017 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (R&D plus MG&A), and capital expenditures. We publish our Business Outlook in our quarterly earnings release. Our Business Outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our Investor Relations website, www.intc.com. This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K. The statements in the Business Outlook and forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. The forward-looking statements in the Business Outlook will be effective through the close of business on March 17, 2017, unless updated earlier. From the close of business on March 17, 2017 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for April 27, 2017, we will observe a ""quiet period."" During the quiet period, the Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 26, 2017, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company's news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update.

The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion.30Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Critical Accounting EstimatesThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our financial position and the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of these policies require us to make subjective estimates and apply judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include:•the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; •the determination of useful lives for our property, plant and equipment and the timing of when depreciation should begin, which impacts our gross margin, R&D expenses, and to a lesser extent MG&A expenses;•the determination of other-than-temporary impairments for non-marketable equity investments requires the use of estimates about their valuations, which impacts gains or losses on equity investments, net; •the valuation and the allocation of purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions, which impacts our gross margin and operating expenses in periods subsequent to the acquisition;•the evaluation of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; identified intangibles; and goodwill), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization;•the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes as well as tax-related assets and liabilities; and•the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment.Refer to ""Note 2: Accounting Policies"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on our critical accounting estimates and policies. 31Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Results of OperationsYears Ended (In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) December 31, 2016 December 26, 2015 December 27, 2014 Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenueNet revenue $59,387 100.0 % $55,355 100.0 % $55,870 100.0%Cost of sales 23,196 39.1 % 20,676 37.4 % 20,261 36.3%Gross margin 36,191 60.9 % 34,679 62.6 % 35,609 63.7%Research and development 12,740 21.5 % 12,128 21.9 % 11,537 20.6%Marketing, general and administrative 8,397 14.0 % 7,930 14.3 % 8,136 14.6%Restructuring and other charges 1,886 3.2 % 354 0.6 % 295 0.5%Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 294 0.5 % 265 0.5 % 294 0.5%Operating income 12,874 21.7 % 14,002 25.3 % 15,347 27.5%Gains (losses) on equity investments, net 506 0.9 % 315 0.6 % 411 0.7%Interest and other, net (444) (0.8)% (105) (0.2)% 43 0.1%Income before taxes 12,936 21.8 % 14,212 25.7 % 15,801 28.3%Provision for taxes 2,620 4.4 % 2,792 5.1 % 4,097 7.4%Net income $10,316 17.4 % $11,420 20.6 % $11,704 20.9%Diluted earnings per share of common stock $2.12 $2.33 $2.31 Our net revenue in 2016 increased by $4.0 billion, or 7%, compared to 2015. Our results in 2016 reflected the inclusion of PSG from the newly acquired Altera and an extra work week, compared to 2015. The higher revenue was also driven by higher unit sales from our DCG platform and higher average selling prices from our notebook and desktop platforms. Our net revenue in 2015 decreased by $515 million, or 1%, compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue was due to challenging macroeconomic conditions, particularly in the first half of the year, and higher PC demand in 2014 driven by the Microsoft Windows XP* refresh. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher platform average selling prices on desktop and DCG platforms, higher DCG platform unit sales, along with higher NSG revenue.32Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Our overall gross margin percentage was 60.9% in 2016, down from 62.6% in 2015, and down from 63.7% in 2014. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars from the sale of platforms in the CCG and DCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in 2016 increased by $1.5 billion, or 4%, compared to 2015, and in 2015 decreased by $930 million, or 3%, compared to 2014.

Additionally, we incurred approximately $387 million of additional cost of sales charges during the period that would have been excluded from the operating results in 2016 if the acquired inventory had not been remeasured to fair value upon acquisition and then sold to end customers, resulting in zero margin on that inventory for the period. 38Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Operating ExpensesYears Ended (In Millions) Dec 31, 2016 Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014Research and development (R&D) $12,740 $12,128 $11,537Marketing, general and administrative (MG&A) $8,397 $7,930 $8,136R&D and MG&A as percentage of net revenue 35.6% 36.2% 35.2%Restructuring and other charges $1,886 $354 $295Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles $294 $265 $294Research and DevelopmentR&D spending increased by $612 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was driven by the addition of PSG expenses from the acquisition of Altera, higher investment, net of 2016 restructuring program savings, in strategically important areas such as servers, Internet of Things, new devices, and memory, as well as higher process development costs for our new 7nm process technology. These increases were partially offset by lower depreciation expense due to a change at the beginning of fiscal year 2016 to the estimated useful life of our machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities.R&D spending increased by $591 million, or 5%, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was due to higher investment in our products—primarily server, Internet of Things, and new devices—as well as expenses of newly acquired entities and higher process development costs for our 10nm process technology. This increase was partially offset by lower profit-dependent compensation and savings from the implementation of efficiencies within our CCG operating segment.Marketing, General and AdministrativeMG&A expenses increased by $467 million, or 6%, in 2016 compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to PSG expenses from the acquisition of Altera. MG&A expenses decreased by $206 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease was due to lower profit-dependent compensation as well as lower expenses from businesses that have been divested.Restructuring and Other ChargesYears Ended (In Millions) Dec 31, 2016 Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 20142016 Restructuring Program $1,823 $— $—2015 Restructuring Program — 264 —2013 Restructuring Program — 90 295Other charges 63 — —Total restructuring and other charges $1,886 $354 $2952016 Restructuring Program. In Q2 2016, our management approved and commenced the 2016 Restructuring Program to accelerate our transformation from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices. Under this program, we are in the process of closing certain facilities and reducing headcount globally to align our operations with evolving business needs by investing in our growth businesses and improving efficiencies. We expect these actions to be substantially completed by Q2 2017.39Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Restructuring actions related to this program that were approved in 2016 are expected to impact approximately 15,000 employees. We estimate that the charges incurred to date as part of the 2016 restructuring program will result in net annual headcount savings of approximately $1.6 billion as we re-balance our workforce. On an annual basis, we expect $1.4 billion of these savings will reduce our R&D and MG&A spending, and the remainder will reduce our cost of sales. We began to realize these savings in Q2 2016 and expect to fully realize these savings by Q2 2017. We are reallocating these savings to our growth segments, such as the data center and Internet of Things, and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership in Moore's Law and expand market opportunities in areas such as memory and autonomous driving. For further information on the 2016 Restructuring Program, see ""Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 2015 Restructuring Program. During 2015, management approved and commenced implementation of restructuring actions, primarily targeted workforce reductions, as we adjusted resources from areas of disinvestment to areas of investment. This program was completed in 2015.2013 Restructuring Program. During 2013, management approved and commenced implementation of several restructuring actions, including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities. These actions included the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Massachusetts and the closure of our assembly and test facility in Costa Rica. This program was completed in 2015. Other Charges. Other charges consist primarily of expenses associated with the planned divestiture of ISecG that was announced in Q3 2016. Share-Based CompensationShare-based compensation totaled $1.4 billion in 2016 ($1.3 billion in 2015 and $1.1 billion in 2014).

Most of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was driven by one-time items, a higher proportion of our income from lower tax jurisdictions, and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years' non-U.S. earnings, which positively impacted our effective income tax rate. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesWe consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources: (Dollars in Millions) Dec 31, 2016 Dec 26, 2015Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets $17,099 $25,313Other long-term investments $4,716 $1,891Loans receivable and other $996 $1,170Reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months $250 $1,000Unsettled trade liabilities and other $119 $99Short-term and long-term debt $25,283 $22,670Temporary equity $882 $897Debt as percentage of permanent stockholders’ equity 38.2% 37.1%41Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions)In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:Years Ended (In Millions) Dec 31, 2016 Dec 26, 2015 Dec 27, 2014Net cash provided by operating activities $21,808 $19,017 $20,418Net cash used for investing activities (25,817) (8,183) (9,905)Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (5,739) 1,912 (13,611)Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents — 1 (15)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $(9,748) $12,747 $(3,113)42Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.For 2016 compared to 2015, the $2.8 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working capital, partially offset by lower net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher in 2016 primarily due to restructuring and other charges and the change in deferred taxes, partially offset by lower depreciation expense. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2016 compared to 2015 were $2.6 billion lower due to bonus depreciation on capital assets placed in service, as well as timing of certain tax payments and refunds.For 2015 compared to 2014, the $1.4 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital, adjustments for non-cash items, and lower net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were lower due primarily to deferred taxes, partially offset by higher depreciation.Investing ActivitiesInvesting cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $9.6 billion in 2016 ($7.3 billion in 2015 and $10.1 billion in 2014). The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to our completed acquisition of Altera, net purchases of trading assets in 2016 compared to net sales of trading assets in 2015, and higher capital expenditures in 2016. This increase was partially offset by lower investments in non-marketable equity investments and collection of loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements.The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to cash generated by net trading asset activity and lower capital expenditures during 2015. This activity was partially offset by net available-for-sale activity (which was cash flow neutral in 2015 compared to a source of cash in 2014) and higher investments in non-marketable equity investments during 2015.Financing ActivitiesFinancing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.Cash was used for financing activities in 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015, primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and the repayment of $1.5 billion of debt in 2016. These amounts were partially offset by repayment of commercial paper in 2015 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program. We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005, and subsequently amended, to repurchase up to $65.0 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. During 2016, we repurchased $2.6 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $3.0 billion in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, $6.8 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled $1.1 billion in 2016 compared to $866 million in 2015. Our total dividend payments were $4.9 billion in 2016 compared to $4.6 billion in 2015. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 97 quarters. In January 2017, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock for Q1 2017. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2017 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2017.Cash was provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014, primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2015 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program in 2015 compared to 2014. This activity was partially offset by lower proceeds from the sales of common stock in 2015 and repayments of short-term debt in 2015 compared to borrowings in 2014. 43Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)LiquidityCash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. When assessing our sources of liquidity we include investments as shown in the Liquidity and Capital Resources table. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $5.0 billion. No commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016. On December 21, 2015, we entered into a short-term credit facility to borrow up to $5.0 billion to facilitate the settlement of our acquisition of Altera. Under this credit facility we borrowed $4.0 billion, and the facility was closed in January 2016. In Q2 2016, we issued $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to refinance existing indebtedness, including our 1.95% senior notes due 2016 and a portion of our 1.35% senior notes due 2017. As of December 31, 2016, $13.6 billion of our $17.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $13.6 billion held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, approximately $1.5 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of December 31, 2016. The remaining amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and, therefore, no U.S. current or deferred taxes have been accrued. This amount is earmarked for near-term investment in our operations outside the U.S. and future acquisitions of non-U.S. entities. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the U.S., and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Under current tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., such amounts would be subject to U.S. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes.We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, and strategic investments.44Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Contractual ObligationsSignificant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 were as follows: Payments Due by Period(In Millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years More Than5 YearsOperating lease obligations $1,226 $229 $342 $233 $422Capital purchase obligations1 7,529 5,646 1,882 1 —Other purchase obligations and commitments2 3,038 1,825 1,154 59 —Long-term debt obligations3 42,020 4,391 2,459 5,854 29,316Other long-term liabilities4, 5 1,763 841 707 114 101Total6 $55,576 $12,932 $6,544 $6,261 $29,8391 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. 3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments.4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $125 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes.5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $36 million to be made during 2017 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2017 are not practicable to estimate. Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table, as they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid.6 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in ""Other purchase obligations and commitments"" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.45Table of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding or payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding (excluding investment funding that is pending regulatory approval). These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty. As of December 31, 2016, assuming that all future milestones are met, excluding the ASML milestones mentioned below, the additional required payments would be approximately $694 million. During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of EUV lithography, certain of which were amended in 2014. Under the amended agreements, Intel agreed to provide R&D funding totaling €829 million over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our remaining obligation, contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, is approximately €193 million, or $202 million, as of December 31, 2016. As our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones, we have excluded this obligation from the preceding table.For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.During 2014, we entered into a series of agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. (Tsinghua Unigroup), an operating subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co. Ltd., to, among other things, jointly develop Intel architecture- and communications-based solutions for phones. Subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, we have also agreed to invest up to 9.0 billion Chinese yuan (approximately $1.5 billion as of the date of the agreement) for a minority stake of approximately 20% of Beijing UniSpreadtrum Technology Ltd. (UniSpreadtrum). During 2015, we invested $966 million to complete the first phase of the equity investment. The second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately $500 million; however, as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, it has been excluded from the preceding table.Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.46Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impact of these risks. All of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange RatesWe are exposed to currency exchange risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable, and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains or losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments. We are exposed to currency exchange risks from our non-U.S.-dollar-denominated debt indebtedness and may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk.Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan. We have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-U.S. dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities. We may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency-denominated future investments. We may utilize foreign currency contracts, such as currency forward or option contracts in these hedging programs. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $80 million as of December 31, 2016 (less than $75 million as of December 26, 2015).Interest RatesWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We may enter into swaps to convert fixed-rate coupon payments into floating-rate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness. Gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments.A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $100 million as of December 31, 2016 (an increase of approximately $15 million as of December 26, 2015). After taking into account interest rate and currency swaps, a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 (an increase of approximately $1.6 billion as of December 26, 2015). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher fluctuation in the fair value of our net investment position. Equity PricesOur investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments. Before we enter into hedge arrangements, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors, as well as the expected timing of disposal, to determine whether hedging is appropriate. Our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants, equity options, or other equity derivatives. We also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. Gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities.47Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $6.2 billion ($6.0 billion as of December 26, 2015). Substantially all of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of December 31, 2016 was concentrated in our investment in ASML of $6.1 billion ($5.7 billion as of December 26, 2015). Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a decline of 30% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $1.9 billion, based on the value as of December 31, 2016 (a decrease in value of approximately $1.8 billion, based on the value as of December 26, 2015 using an assumed decline of 30%).Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable cost method equity investments had a carrying amount of $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2016 ($2.9 billion as of December 26, 2015) and included our investment in UniSpreadtrum and Cloudera, Inc. (Cloudera) of $966 million and $454 million, respectively ($966 million and $454 million for UniSpreadtrum and Cloudera, respectively, as of December 26, 2015). The carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 ($1.6 billion as of December 26, 2015). A substantial majority of our non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 31, 2016 was concentrated in our IMFT and Cloudera investments of $849 million and $225 million, respectively ($872 million and $256 million for IMFT and Cloudera, respectively, as of December 26, 2015).Commodity Price RiskAlthough we operate facilities that consume commodities, we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree. We have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices. We may use commodity derivatives contracts, such as commodity swaps, in these hedging programs. In addition, we have sourcing plans in place for our key commodities that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration. 48",2023-12-30 17:53:13.554963

Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 15, 2008, with the exception of the Numonyx transaction. Our forward-looking statements for 2008 reflect the expectation that the Numonyx transaction will close during the first quarter. Overview We make, market, and sell advanced integrated digital technology products, primarily integrated circuits, for industries such as computing and communications. Integrated circuits are semiconductor chips etched with interconnected electronic switches. Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. Our products include chips, boards, and other semiconductor products that are the building blocks integral to computers, servers, consumer electronics and handheld devices, and networking and communications products. Our primary component-level products include microprocessors, chipsets, and flash memory. We offer products at various levels of integration, allowing our customers the flexibility to create advanced computing and communications systems and products. The life cycle of our products is very short, sometimes less than a year. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors, anticipate changing customer requirements, and develop and launch new products and platforms. Our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete. Maintaining scale is key to our strategy of ramping new manufacturing technologies and platforms quickly, delivering high-performance products, and lowering unit costs. As of December 29, 2007, our operating segments included the Digital Enterprise Group, Mobility Group, NAND Products Group, Flash Memory Group, Digital Home Group, Digital Health Group, and Software Solutions Group. Net revenue, gross margin, and operating income for 2007 and 2006 were as follows: (In Millions) 2007 2006 Net revenue $ 38,334 $ 35,382 Gross margin $ 19,904 $ 18,218 Operating income $ 8,216 $ 5,652 24 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Overall microprocessor revenue continues to grow, and we continue to see a shift in our sales mix from desktop microprocessors to mobile microprocessors. Microprocessor revenue within the Mobility Group operating segment increased by 16% in 2007 compared to 2006. The growth in mobile microprocessors has outpaced the growth in desktop microprocessors, and we believe this trend will continue, with a crossover occurring as early as 2009. As demand for mobile microprocessors continues to grow in the PC market segment, system price points have expanded to include new lower prices. We expect continuing erosion in average selling prices for mobile microprocessors due to this expansion in lower price points and a continued competitive market segment. However, mobile microprocessor average selling prices remain higher than desktop microprocessor average selling prices, and therefore the shift in our mix to mobile microprocessors has a positive effect on our results. Due to the price differences among mobile, desktop, and server microprocessors, the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue. The gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2007 compared to 2006. During 2007, gross margin benefited from lower microprocessor unit costs as well as a mix shift toward higher margin businesses. The decline in unit costs has been possible as we continued to gain production experience on our 65nm process technology. In addition, we are running our factories at high volumes. However, during 2007 our gross margin was negatively impacted by declining average selling prices as well as higher start-up costs related to our 45nm process technology. Our operating income grew faster than revenue during 2007 as we continued to implement our restructuring program and focused on our commitment to efficiency and on spending controls. As a result, R&D and marketing, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 34% in 2006 to 29% in 2007, and the number of employees decreased by 8% compared to the end of 2006. Results for 2007 included restructuring and asset impairment charges of $516 million, and to date we have incurred $1.1 billion in charges related to the program, which began in the third quarter of 2006. We expect to continue the program in 2008, and expect charges to decline in the second half of the year. As part of the restructuring program, we divested some of our lower margin businesses, and we expect to divest our NOR flash memory assets in the first quarter of 2008. As a result of these divestitures, we expect a negative impact on revenue and a benefit to our gross margin percentage in 2008. Our efficiency efforts have also contributed to faster factory throughput, higher yields, and improved equipment utilization. Improvements in our equipment utilization helped enable us to reduce our capital spending from $5.9 billion in 2006 to $5.0 billion in 2007. The combination of our technological innovation and our renewed commitment to customer orientation has differentiated our products and technology from our competition and has contributed to our revenue growth, which occurred in nearly all product lines and across all geographies. We are setting the pace for innovation within the industry by executing on our plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and to ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. In 2007, we completed our transition to the Intel Core microarchitecture, initially launched in 2006, in all market segments. We also started manufacturing microprocessors using our industry-leading 45nm Hi-k metal gate silicon technology, which enables higher and more energy-efficient processor performance. Our next-generation microarchitecture is scheduled for production in the second half of 2008; and we are also developing our next-generation 32nm process technology and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in 2009. From a financial condition perspective, we ended 2007 with an investment portfolio valued at $19.3 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, fixed-income debt instruments included in trading assets, and short- and long-term investments. During 2007, we repurchased $2.75 billion of stock through our stock repurchase program and paid $2.6 billion to stockholders as dividends. We exited 2007 with what we believe is the strongest combination of products, manufacturing, and silicon technology leadership in our history as we continue to ramp our 45nm process technology and plan to introduce our next-generation microarchitecture in 2008. Also in 2008, we plan to introduce products geared to future growth markets. Specifically, we plan to introduce new microprocessors, code-named “Silverthorne,” that are designed for notebooks, low-power and low-cost products, MIDs, and consumer electronics devices. In addition to our microprocessor and chipset development, we expect to make significant investments in R&D in 2008 in growth areas such as system-on-a-chip, MIDs, embedded applications, consumer electronics, and graphics. Although there is uncertainty in the global economy, we are planning for another year of growth in which profits grow faster than revenue and our investments in products, manufacturing, and silicon technology continue to generate competitive advantages. 25 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. As part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment, we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our financial resources, global presence, and brand recognition. We believe that we have the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly. Some of our key focus areas are listed below: • Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We offer platforms with ingredients designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized user computing solution compared to ingredients that are used separately. • Energy-Efficient Performance. We believe that users of computing and communications systems and devices want improved overall and energy-efficient performance. Improved overall performance can include faster processing performance and other capabilities such as multithreading and multitasking. Performance can also be improved through enhanced connectivity, security, manageability, reliability, ease of use, and interoperability among devices. Improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing the addition of these and other types of improved performance factors with lower power consumption. Our microprocessors have one, two, or four processor cores, and we continue to develop processors with an increasing number of cores, which enable improved multitasking and energy efficiency. • Design and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. Our strategy for developing microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. We plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. This coordinated schedule allows us to develop and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for the next generation of silicon process technology. We refer to this as our “tick-tock” technology development cadence. For more information, see “Research and Development” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K. • Strategic Investments. We make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and to support our key business initiatives, including investments through our Intel Capital program. We generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. Our current investment focus areas include those that we believe help to enable mobile wireless devices, advance the digital home, enhance the digital enterprise, advance high-performance communications infrastructures, and develop the next generation of silicon process technologies. Our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology. • Business Environment and Software. We plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. We also provide development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. We frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting organizations. In addition, we work collaboratively with other companies to protect digital content and the consumer. Lastly, through our Software and Solutions Group, we help enable and advance the computing ecosystem by developing value-added software products and services. We believe that the proliferation of the Internet, including user demand for premium content and rich media, is the primary driver of the need for greater performance in PCs and servers. A growing number of older PCs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users are demanding, such as streaming video, uploading photos, and online gaming. As these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power, we believe that users will need and want to buy new PCs to perform everyday tasks on the Internet. We also believe that increased Internet traffic is creating a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance. We have experienced an overall shift in sales mix from desktop microprocessors to mobile microprocessors. We believe that, based on customer demand and market trends, mobile microprocessor shipments will exceed desktop microprocessor shipments as early as 2009. Mobile microprocessors generally have higher average selling prices compared to desktop microprocessors, so the continued shift in sales mix to mobile microprocessors is expected to positively impact our revenue. Therefore, our strategy focuses on advancing mobile microprocessors to accelerate this shift in sales mix. 26 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) We are investing in areas in which we believe the application of highly integrated Intel® architecture provides growth opportunities, such as scalable, high-performance visual computing solutions that integrate vivid graphics and supercomputing performance for scientific, financial services, and other compute-intensive applications. In addition, our design and manufacturing technology leadership, including the recent introduction of our new 45nm process technology, allows us to develop low-cost, low-power microprocessors for new uses and form factors. We believe that these new microprocessors will give us the ability to extend Intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments, including MIDs, a new category of small, mobile consumer devices enabling a PC-like Internet experience; consumer electronics devices, which will deliver media and services to set-top boxes and TVs over broadband Internet connections; and ultra-low-cost PCs designed for emerging markets. We believe that the common elements for products in these new market segments are low power, low cost, and the ability to access the Internet. Strategy by Operating Segment Our Digital Enterprise Group (DEG) offers computing and communications products for businesses, service providers, and consumers. DEG products are incorporated into desktop computers, enterprise computer servers, workstations, and products that make up the infrastructure for the Internet. We also offer products for embedded designs, such as industrial equipment, point-of-sale systems, panel PCs, automotive information/entertainment systems, and medical equipment. Within DEG, our largest market segments are in desktop and enterprise computing. Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy-efficient performance while at the same time lowering total cost of ownership for businesses. Our strategy for the enterprise computing market segment is to offer products that provide energy-efficient performance, ease of use, manageability, reliability, and security for entry-level to high-end servers and workstations. The strategy for our Mobility Group is to offer notebook PC products designed to improve performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. We are also increasing our focus on notebooks designed for the business environment by offering products that provide increased manageability and security, and we continue to invest in the build-out of WiMAX. For the ultra-mobile market segment, we offer energy-efficient products that are designed primarily for mobile processing of digital content and Internet access, and we are developing new products to support this evolving market segment, including products for MIDs and ultra-mobile PCs. The strategy for our NAND Products Group is to offer advanced NAND flash memory products, primarily used in digital audio players, memory cards, and system-level applications, such as solid-state drives. In support of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products, we continue to focus on the development of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable, non-volatile, low-cost, high-density memory. For the Flash Memory Group, we expect to complete the divestiture of our NOR flash memory assets to Numonyx during the first quarter of 2008. We expect to enter into supply and transition service agreements to provide products, services, and support to Numonyx following the close of the transaction. See “Note 13: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The strategy for our Digital Home Group is to offer products for use in PCs and in-home consumer electronics devices designed to access and share Internet, broadcast, optical media, and personal content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home. We are focusing on the design of components for high-end enthusiast PCs, mainstream PCs with rich audio and video capabilities, and consumer electronic devices such as digital TVs, high-definition media players, and set-top boxes. The strategy for our Digital Health Group is to design and deliver technology-enabled products and explore global business opportunities in healthcare information technology, healthcare research, and productivity, as well as personal healthcare. In support of this strategy, we are focusing on the design of technology solutions and platforms for the digital hospital and consumer/home health products. The strategy for our Software and Solutions Group (SSG) is to promote Intel architecture as the platform of choice for software and services. SSG works with the worldwide software and services ecosystem by providing software products, engaging with developers, and driving strategic software investments. 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: • the valuation of non-marketable equity investments, which impacts net gains (losses) on equity investments when we record impairments; • the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation; • the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our tax provision; • the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and • the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, which impact gross margin; R&D expenses; and marketing, general and administrative expenses. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as those for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors; however, these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity investments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $3.4 billion at December 29, 2007 ($2.8 billion at December 30, 2006) and included our investment in IMFT of $2.2 billion ($1.3 billion at December 30, 2006). Our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and a number of these companies are likely to fail. Their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other factors. In addition, depending on their future prospects and market conditions, they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our investments would likely become impaired. We review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment; however, for non-marketable equity investments, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment. The indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include: • the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects; • the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies; • the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; • factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and • the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. If an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or a new round of equity funding is required for the investee to remain in business, and the new round of equity does not appear imminent, it is presumed that the investment is other than temporarily impaired, unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise. Investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired, in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. For non-marketable equity investments that we do not consider viable from a financial or technological point of view, we write down the entire investment, since we consider the estimated fair value to be nominal. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2007, impairments of non-marketable equity investments have ranged between $10 million and $44 million per quarter. 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Long-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. Recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying amount and its fair value, based on the best information available, including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis. Impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2007, impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets have ranged between $1 million and $320 million per quarter. This range includes restructuring charges for asset impairments between zero and $317 million per quarter. Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In the first quarter of 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of SFAS No. 109” (FIN 48), and related guidance (see “Note 17: Taxes” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. Share-Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), “Shared-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)). SFAS No. 123(R) requires employee equity awards to be accounted for under the fair value method. Total share-based compensation during 2007 was $952 million ($1.4 billion in 2006). Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant require judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share-based awards consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model, also require the use of input assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, expected dividend rate, and expected risk-free rate of return. The assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value. Changes in the expected dividend rate and expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining these inputs is not highly subjective. We use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of implied volatility, we considered the following: • the volume of market activity of freely traded options, and determined that there was sufficient market activity; • the ability to reasonably match the input variables of freely traded options to those of options granted by the company, such as the date of grant and the exercise price, and determined that the input assumptions were comparable; and • the term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility, which is generally one to two years, and determined that the length of term was sufficient. Due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to the majority of our historical grants, management does not believe that our historical share option exercise data provides us with sufficient evidence to estimate expected term. Therefore, we use the simplified method of calculating expected life described in the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 (SAB 107). In December 2007, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 110 (SAB 110) to amend the SEC’s views discussed in SAB 107 regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). SAB 110 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life, in accordance with SAB 107, as amended by SAB 110. 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to share-based compensation determined at the date of grant. The effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of option awards and the increase in total fair value during 2007 and 2006 were as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Average Increase in Total Weighted Average Increase in Total Fair Value Per Fair Value1 Fair Value Per Fair Value1 Share (In Millions) Share (In Millions) As reported $ 5.79 $ 5.21 Hypothetical: Increase expected volatility by 5 percentage points2 $ 6.56 $ 20 $ 5.92 $ 36 Increase expected life by 1 year $ 6.24 $ 12 $ 5.68 $ 24 1 Amounts represent the hypothetical increase in the total fair value determined at the date of grant, which would be amortized over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. 2 For example, an increase from 26% reported volatility for 2007 to a hypothetical 31% volatility. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Quarterly adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported share-based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization after January 1, 2006 in the period in which the estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted. We estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than our previously estimated forfeiture rate, we make an adjustment that will result in a decrease in the expense recognized in the financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, we make an adjustment that will result in an increase in the expense recognized in the financial statements. These adjustments affect our gross margin; R&D expenses; and marketing, general and administrative expenses. The effect of forfeiture adjustments in 2006 and 2007 was insignificant. We record cumulative adjustments to the extent that the related expense is recognized in the financial statements, beginning with implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) in the first quarter of 2006. Therefore, the potential impact from cumulative forfeiture adjustments will increase in future periods. The expense that we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and from our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates. Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Changes See “Note 2: Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: 2007 2006 2005 % of % of % of (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Net revenue $ 38,334 100.0 % $ 35,382 100.0 % $ 38,826 100.0 % Cost of sales 18,430 48.1 % 17,164 48.5 % 15,777 40.6 % Gross margin 19,904 51.9 % 18,218 51.5 % 23,049 59.4 % Research and development 5,755 15.0 % 5,873 16.6 % 5,145 13.3 % Marketing, general and administrative 5,401 14.1 % 6,096 17.2 % 5,688 14.7 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges 516 1.3 % 555 1.6 % — — Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs 16 0.1 % 42 0.1 % 126 0.3 % Operating income 8,216 21.4 % 5,652 16.0 % 12,090 31.1 % Gains (losses) on equity investments, net 157 0.4 % 214 0.6 % (45 ) (0.1 )% Interest and other, net 793 2.1 % 1,202 3.4 % 565 1.5 % Income before taxes 9,166 23.9 % 7,068 20.0 % 12,610 32.5 % Provision for taxes 2,190 5.7 % 2,024 5.7 % 3,946 10.2 % Net income $ 6,976 18.2 % $ 5,044 14.3 % $ 8,664 22.3 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.18 $ 0.86 $ 1.40 The following table sets forth revenue information of geographic regions for the periods indicated: 2007 2006 2005 % of % of % of (Dollars in Millions) Dollars Total Dollars Total Dollars Total Asia-Pacific $ 19,432 51 % $ 17,477 49 % $ 19,330 50 % Americas 7,715 20 % 7,512 21 % 7,574 19 % Europe 7,262 19 % 6,587 19 % 8,210 21 % Japan 3,925 10 % 3,806 11 % 3,712 10 % Total net revenue $ 38,334 100 % $ 35,382 100 % $ 38,826 100 % Our net revenue was $38.3 billion in 2007, an increase of 8% compared to 2006. Higher microprocessor unit sales were partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices. Higher mobile chipset unit sales also contributed to the increase in net revenue. Lower NOR flash memory revenue was mostly offset by the ramp of our NAND flash memory business. The decrease in NOR flash memory revenue was due to a significant decline in average selling prices. Lower royalty revenue was offset by higher unit sales. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 11% and revenue in the Europe region increased 10% in 2007 compared to 2006, and revenue in both the Americas region and Japan increased 3% in 2007 compared to 2006. Revenue from both mature and emerging markets increased in 2007 compared to 2006. While the revenue in mature markets increased in all four geographic regions, the majority of the growth in revenue occurred in the Asia-Pacific region. A substantial majority of the increase in emerging markets also occurred in the Asia-Pacific region. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Our overall gross margin dollars for 2007 were $19.9 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 9%, compared to 2006. Our overall gross margin percentage was relatively flat at 51.9% in 2007 compared to 51.5% in 2006. The gross margin percentage increase in the Digital Enterprise Group operating segment was mostly offset by a decrease in the gross margin percentage in the Mobility Group operating segment and costs associated with the ramp of our NAND flash memory business. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in 2007 and 2006 from the sale of microprocessors in the Digital Enterprise Group and Mobility Group operating segments. See “Business Outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations. Our net revenue was $35.4 billion in 2006, a decrease of 9% compared to 2005. Substantially all of the decrease was due to significantly lower average selling prices of microprocessors. Fiscal year 2006 was a 52-week fiscal year in contrast to fiscal year 2005, which was a 53-week fiscal year. Revenue from sales of NOR flash memory products decreased in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to lower average selling prices, partially offset by higher royalty revenue. In 2006, we began shipping NAND flash memory products manufactured by IMFT. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region decreased 10% and revenue in the Europe region decreased 20% in 2006 compared to 2005. These decreases were slightly offset by revenue in Japan, which increased slightly in 2006 compared to 2005. Revenue in the Americas region was approximately flat in 2006 compared to 2005. Mature and emerging markets both declined in 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease within mature markets occurred in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, and a substantial majority of the decrease within the emerging markets occurred in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2006 were $18.2 billion, a decrease of $4.8 billion, or 21%, compared to 2005. Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 51.5% in 2006 from 59.4% in 2005. The gross margin percentage for the Digital Enterprise Group and the Mobility Group were both lower in 2006 compared to 2005. A mix shift of our total revenue to the Mobility Group, which has a higher gross margin percentage, slightly offset these decreases to the overall gross margin. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2006 and 2005 from the sale of microprocessors in the Digital Enterprise Group and Mobility Group operating segments. The 2006 gross margin included the impact of share-based compensation, which we began recognizing in 2006. The 2005 gross margin was affected by a litigation settlement agreement with MicroUnity, Inc. in which we recorded a $140 million charge to cost of sales, of which $110 million was allocated to the Digital Enterprise Group and $30 million was allocated to the Mobility Group. Digital Enterprise Group The revenue and operating income for the Digital Enterprise Group (DEG) for the three years ended December 29, 2007 were as follows: (In Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Microprocessor revenue $ 15,234 $ 14,606 $ 19,412 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 5,106 5,270 5,725 Net revenue $ 20,340 $ 19,876 $ 25,137 Operating income $ 5,169 $ 3,510 $ 9,020 Net revenue for the DEG operating segment increased by $464 million, or 2%, in 2007 compared to 2006. Microprocessors within DEG include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor unit sales and higher enterprise average selling prices. These increases were partially offset by lower desktop average selling prices in a competitive pricing environment. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to lower motherboard unit sales as well as a decrease in communications infrastructure revenue, which is primarily due to divestitures of certain communications infrastructure businesses that were completed in 2006 and 2007. Partially offsetting these decreases was higher chipset revenue. Operating income increased by $1.7 billion, or 47%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to lower desktop microprocessor unit costs and lower operating expenses, and to a lesser extent, sales of desktop microprocessor inventory that had been previously written off. Partially offsetting these increases were higher chipset unit costs and approximately $425 million of higher start-up costs, primarily related to our 45nm process technology. In 2007, we began including shared-based compensation in the computation of operating income (loss) for each operating segment and adjusted the 2006 operating segment results to reflect this change. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) For 2006, net revenue for the DEG operating segment decreased by $5.3 billion, or 21%, compared to 2005. The decline in net revenue was mostly due to a significant decline in microprocessor revenue, and to a lesser extent, a decline in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue. The decline in microprocessor revenue was due to lower average selling prices and unit sales of desktop microprocessors. Enterprise microprocessor revenue increased in 2006. The decline in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due equally to lower chipset revenue and motherboard revenue. Operating income decreased by $5.5 billion, or 61%, in 2006 compared to 2005. Substantially all of the decrease was due to the revenue decline. Higher microprocessor unit costs, along with $210 million of higher factory under-utilization charges, were offset by approximately $540 million of lower start-up costs. Unit costs were higher in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to a mix shift to dual-core microprocessors. Results for 2006 included the recognition of share-based compensation. Results for 2005 did not include share-based compensation. Results for 2005 included a charge related to a settlement agreement with MicroUnity. Mobility Group The revenue and operating income for the Mobility Group (MG) for the three years ended December 29, 2007 were as follows: (In Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Microprocessor revenue $ 10,660 $ 9,212 $ 8,704 Chipset and other revenue 4,021 3,097 2,427 Net revenue $ 14,681 $ 12,309 $ 11,131 Operating income $ 5,606 $ 4,595 $ 5,335 Net revenue for the MG operating segment increased by $2.4 billion, or 19%, in 2007 compared to 2006. Microprocessor revenue increased by $1.4 billion, or 16%, in 2007 compared to 2006, while chipsets and other revenue increased by $924 million, or 30%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to a significant increase in unit sales, partially offset by significantly lower average selling prices. The increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher unit sales of chipsets, and to a lesser extent, higher revenue from sales of cellular baseband products. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we sold certain assets of the business line that included application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices; however, in 2007 we continued to manufacture and sell these products as part of a manufacturing and transition services agreement. Operating income increased by $1.0 billion, or 22%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue. Lower microprocessor unit costs were more than offset by approximately $330 million of higher start-up costs, primarily related to our 45nm process technology. Lower unit costs on wireless connectivity and cellular baseband products were offset by higher chipset unit costs. Operating expenses were higher in 2007 compared to 2006; however, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2007 compared to 2006. For 2006, net revenue for the MG operating segment increased by $1.2 billion, or 11%, compared to 2005. Microprocessor revenue increased by $508 million, or 6%, in 2006 compared to 2005, while chipsets and other revenue increased by $670 million, or 28%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher unit sales, largely offset by lower average selling prices. The majority of the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher revenue from sales of chipsets, and to a lesser extent, higher revenue from sales of wireless connectivity products. Sales of these products increased primarily due to increased sales of our Intel Centrino processor technologies. Operating income decreased by $740 million, or 14%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The decline was primarily caused by higher operating expenses, due in part to the recognition of share-based compensation. Results for 2005 did not include share-based compensation. The effects of higher revenue were offset by higher unit costs for microprocessors. Start-up costs were approximately $170 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005. 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 29, 2007 were as follows: (In Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Research and development $ 5,755 $ 5,873 $ 5,145 Marketing, general and administrative $ 5,401 $ 6,096 $ 5,688 Restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 516 $ 555 $ — Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs $ 16 $ 42 $ 126 Research and Development. R&D spending decreased $118 million, or 2%, in 2007 compared to 2006, and increased $728 million, or 14%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower process development costs as we transitioned from R&D to manufacturing using our 45nm process technology, partially offset by higher profit-dependent compensation. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to share-based compensation resulting from the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006, and to a lesser extent, higher development costs driven by our 45nm process technology. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased $695 million, or 11%, in 2007 compared to 2006, and increased $408 million, or 7%, in 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower headcount, lower share-based compensation, and lower cooperative advertising expenses, partially offset by higher profit-dependent compensation. The increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to share-based compensation resulting from the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006, and to a lesser extent, higher headcount. Partially offsetting these increases were lower marketing program spending and lower profit-dependent compensation. R&D along with marketing, general and administrative expenses were 29% of net revenue in 2007, 34% of net revenue in 2006, and 28% of net revenue in 2005. Fiscal year 2005 included 53 weeks. The percentage decline in 2007 compared to 2006 is an indication of our progress toward improving our cost structure and efficiency as we grew revenue at a faster rate than operating expenses. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions that were recommended by our structure and efficiency task force as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. Some of these activities involve cost savings or other actions that do not result in restructuring charges, such as better utilization of assets, reduced spending, and organizational efficiencies. The efficiency program includes headcount targets for various groups within the company, and these targets are being met through ongoing employee attrition and terminations. In addition, business divestitures further reduce our headcount. Restructuring and asset impairment charges for the three years ended December 29, 2007 were as follows: (In Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 289 $ 238 $ — Asset impairments 227 317 — Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 516 $ 555 $ — During 2006, we completed the divestiture of three businesses concurrently with the ongoing execution of our efficiency program. See “Note 13: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. In connection with the divestiture of certain assets of our communications and application processor business, we recorded impairment charges of $103 million related to the write-down of manufacturing tools to their fair value, less the cost to dispose of the assets. We determined the fair value using a market-based valuation technique. In addition, as a result of both this divestiture and a subsequent assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This plan resulted in an impairment charge of $214 million to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment asset grouping that has been principally used to support our communications and application processor business. We determined the fair market value of the asset grouping using an average of the results from using the cost approach and market approach valuation techniques. 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) During 2007, we incurred an additional $54 million in asset impairment charges as a result of softer than anticipated market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility. Also, we recorded land and building write-downs related to certain facilities in Santa Clara, California. In addition, during the fourth quarter we incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to the anticipated divestiture of our NOR flash memory business. The impairment charges were determined using the revised fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture. See “Note 13: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on this divestiture, which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2008. The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for 2006 and 2007: Employee Severance (In Millions) and Benefits Asset Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 31, 2005 $ — $ — $ — Additional accruals 238 317 555 Adjustments — — — Cash payments (190 ) — (190 ) Non-cash settlements — (317 ) (317 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 30, 2006 $ 48 $ — $ 48 Additional accruals 299 227 526 Adjustments (10 ) — (10 ) Cash payments (210 ) — (210 ) Non-cash settlements — (227 ) (227 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2007 $ 127 $ — $ 127 We recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment charges on the consolidated statements of income. The remaining accrual as of December 29, 2007 was related to severance benefits that we recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets. From the third quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of 2007, we incurred a total of $1.1 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this plan. These charges included a total of $527 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements due to the termination of approximately 9,900 employees, of which 7,700 employees had left the company as of December 29, 2007. A substantial majority of these employee terminations affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. Of the employee severance and benefit charges incurred as of December 29, 2007, we had paid $400 million. The restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $544 million in asset impairment charges. We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately $1.0 billion, a portion of which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2006. We are realizing these savings within marketing, general and administrative expenses, cost of sales, and R&D. Our outlook for the first quarter of 2008 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of $100 million. We may incur additional restructuring charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements, as well as facility-related or other exit activities. Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles and Costs. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs was $16 million in 2007 ($42 million in 2006 and $126 million in 2005). The decreased amortization each year compared to the previous year was primarily due to a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions becoming fully amortized. 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Gains (losses) on Equity Investments, Interest and Other, and Provision for Taxes Gains (losses) on equity investments, net; interest and other, net; and provision for taxes for the three years ended December 29, 2007 were as follows: (In Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Gains (losses) on equity investments, net $ 157 $ 214 $ (45 ) Interest and other, net $ 793 $ 1,202 $ 565 Provision for taxes $ (2,190 ) $ (2,024 ) $ (3,946 ) Net gains on equity investments were $157 million in 2007 compared to $214 million in 2006. During 2007, we recognized higher losses from our equity method investments, primarily from our investment in Clearwire Corporation. In addition, we recognized higher impairment charges, partially offset by higher gains on sales of equity investments and other equity transactions. Impairment charges were $120 million in 2007. Net gains on equity investments were $214 million in 2006 compared to net losses of $45 million in 2005. During 2006, we recognized higher gains on sales of equity investments and lower impairment charges compared to 2005. Net gains on equity investments in 2006 included the gain of $103 million on the sale of a portion of our investment in Micron, which was sold for $275 million. Impairment charges were $79 million in 2006 compared to $208 million in 2005. During 2005, impairment charges included a $105 million impairment charge on our investment in Micron. Interest and other, net decreased to $793 million in 2007 compared to $1.2 billion in 2006, primarily due to lower divestiture gains, partially offset by higher interest income resulting primarily from higher average investment balances, and to a lesser extent higher interest rates. Interest and other, net increased to $1.2 billion in 2006 compared to $565 million in 2005, reflecting net gains of $612 million for three divestitures (see “Note 13: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower average investment balances. Our effective income tax rate was 23.9% in 2007 (28.6% in 2006 and 31.3% in 2005). The rate decreased in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $481 million (including $50 million of accrued interest) related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in the first and second quarters of 2007. Our effective income tax rate was lower in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to a higher percentage of our profits being derived from lower tax jurisdictions. In addition, the rate for 2005 included an increase to the tax provision of approximately $265 million as a result of the decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Partially offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate was the impact of share-based compensation. In 2006, the phasing out of the tax benefit for export sales only slightly increased the effective tax rate compared to 2005, given the decrease in income before taxes. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $952 million in 2007, $1.4 billion in 2006, and zero in 2005. Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) under the modified prospective transition method, effective beginning in 2006. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we accounted for our equity incentive plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related interpretations. Accordingly, no share-based compensation was recognized in net income. The decrease in share-based compensation from 2006 to 2007 was a result of fewer equity awards vesting in 2007 compared to 2006. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) As of December 29, 2007, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: Unrecognized Share-Based Weighted Compensation Average (Dollars in Millions) Costs Period Stock options $ 524 1.1 years Restricted stock units $ 707 1.6 years Stock purchase plan $ 16 1 month Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, short-term investments, fixed-income debt instruments included in trading assets, and debt at the end of each period were as follows: Dec. 29, Dec. 30, (Dollars in Millions) 2007 2006 Cash, short-term investments, and fixed-income debt instruments included in trading assets $ 14,871 $ 9,552 Short-term and long-term debt $ 2,122 $ 2,028 Debt as % of stockholders’ equity 5.0 % 5.5 % In summary, our cash flows were as follows: (In Millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 12,625 $ 10,632 $ 14,851 Net cash used for investing activities (9,926 ) (4,988 ) (6,415 ) Net cash used for financing activities (1,990 ) (6,370 ) (9,519 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 709 $ (726 ) $ (1,083 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. For 2007 compared to 2006, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income. Changes to working capital in 2007 from 2006 were approximately flat, with a decrease in inventory levels in 2007 compared to an increase in 2006, offset by higher purchases of trading assets exceeding maturities. Lower product costs and the reclassification of NOR inventory to held for sale in conjunction with our anticipated divestiture of the NOR flash memory business contributed to the lower inventory balance in 2007. In comparison, our inventory increased in 2006 as a result of higher product costs. In 2007, we began designating floating-rate securitized financial instruments purchased after 2006 as trading assets. For 2007 and 2006, our two largest customers accounted for 35% of our net revenue. In 2007, one of these customers accounted for 18% of our net revenue (19% in 2006) and another customer accounted for 17% of our net revenue (16% in 2006). Additionally, these two largest customers accounted for 35% of our accounts receivable at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006. For 2006 compared to 2005, the largest contributing factors to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities were lower net income, lower net maturities of trading assets, and changes in the amount of estimated tax payments, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable balances. Fiscal year 2006 included share-based compensation charges of $1.4 billion (zero for 2005). 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases, maturities, and disposals. For 2007 compared to 2006, the increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to higher purchases of available-for-sale investments. Lower capital spending was mostly offset by lower proceeds from divestitures. During 2007, we purchased more available-for-sale investments, particularly short-term, highly liquid investments, as our level of cash available to invest increased. We received lower cash from divestitures: $32 million for one divestiture in 2007 compared to $752 million for three divestitures in 2006 (see “Note 13: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our capital expenditures were $5.0 billion in 2007 and were primarily for the ramping of our new fabrication facilities. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 are currently expected to be approximately $5.2 billion, plus or minus $200 million. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities. Capital expenditures were $5.9 billion in 2006 and 2005. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments, cash received from divestitures in 2006, and the sale of a portion of our investment in Micron for $275 million. Partially offsetting these impacts, in 2006 we paid $600 million in cash for our equity investment in Clearwire and $615 million in cash for our equity investment in IMFT. In addition to the $615 million paid in cash, our initial investment in IMFT of $1.2 billion included the issuance of $581 million in notes (reflected as a financing activity) and a capital contribution of $128 million. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans. For 2007 compared to 2006, the lower cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans and a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock. Proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $3.1 billion in 2007 compared to $1.0 billion in 2006, due to a higher volume of exercises of stock options because of our stock price trading at higher levels in 2007 compared to 2006, and a higher weighted average exercise price. During 2007, we repurchased 111 million shares of common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program at a cost of $2.75 billion (226 million shares at a cost of $4.6 billion during 2006). As of December 29, 2007, $14.5 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. We base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Our dividend payments for 2007 were $2.6 billion. On January 17, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1275 per common share for the first quarter of 2008, which represents a 13% increase in our quarterly cash dividend amount. The lower cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock, partially offset by additions to long-term debt in 2005 of $1.7 billion. 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Liquidity Cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. As of December 29, 2007, we also had an investment portfolio valued at $19.3 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, fixed-income debt instruments included in trading assets, and short- and long-term investments. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and the substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA/Aa2 or better. In addition to requiring all investments with original maturities of up to six months to be rated at least A-1/P-1 by Standard & Poors/Moody’s, our investment policy specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. For instance, investments with maturities beyond three years require a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3. Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, or the absence of A rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions, which are reviewed annually by the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. As of December 29, 2007, $9.5 billion of our portfolio had a remaining maturity of less than three months, and a substantial majority of our investments have remaining maturities of two years or less. In 2007, we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairments on our portfolio of available-for-sale investments. During 2007, $24 million of unrealized losses were recognized related to debt instruments classified as trading assets, and as of December 29, 2007, $62 million of losses were unrealized related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale. Substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment. As of December, 29, 2007, only $125 million of our investments did not comply with our credit guidelines, due to rating downgrades after the initial investment. However, these investments continue to be rated as investment-grade securities. Our portfolio includes $1.8 billion of asset-backed securities collateralized by first-lien mortgages, credit card debt, student loans, and auto loans. As of December 29, 2007, approximately one-third of our asset-backed securities were collateralized by first-lien mortgages. The mortgage-backed securities have an 80% loan-to-value ratio on average, and they include only first-lien mortgages. The average subordination level of the securities that we held as of December 29, 2007 was 27% (ranging from 18% to 40%), implying that the mortgage pool would have to suffer losses beyond those levels before our securities experience realized losses. In 2007, our asset-backed securities experienced unrealized fair value declines totaling $42 million of which $19 million was recognized in our income statement for those classified under trading assets. As of December 29, 2007, all of our investments in asset-backed securities were rated AAA/Aaa, and the weighted average remaining maturity was less than two years. We have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our Board of Directors. We intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary. Based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment. Another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings, including commercial paper, of up to $3.0 billion. There were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2007. We also have an automatic shelf registration on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt, equity, and other securities. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity, working capital requirements, the dividend program, potential stock repurchases, and potential acquisitions or strategic investments. 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 29, 2007: Payments Due by Period Less than More than (In Millions) Total 1 Year 1–3 years 3–5 years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 320 $ 95 $ 117 $ 56 $ 52 Capital purchase obligations1 2,289 2,283 6 — — Other purchase obligations and commitments2 1,662 600 925 137 — Long-term debt obligations3 3,653 73 305 133 3,142 Other long-term liabilities3, 4 1,444 308 345 187 604 Total5 $ 9,368 $ 3,359 $ 1,698 $ 513 $ 3,798 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2007, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. Capital purchase obligations decreased from $3.3 billion at December 30, 2006 to $2.3 billion at December 29, 2007, primarily due to the timing of the ramp of our latest silicon process technology. 2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses, agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent total anticipated cash payments, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the short-term portion of the obligation. Any future settlement of convertible debt would reduce anticipated interest and/or principal payments. Amounts exclude fair value adjustments such as discounts or premiums that affect the amount recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. 4 Other long-term liabilities includes income taxes payable. Long-term income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet been paid. We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $785 million of income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above. 5 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities (except for the short-term portion of the long-term debt and other long-term liabilities) and certain purchase obligations, which are discussed below. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The table above also includes agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. For other obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the table above were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms, and/or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods that specify minimum prices and quantities that are based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the table above. We estimate our obligation under these agreements as of December 29, 2007 to be approximately as follows: less than one year—$331 million; one to three years—$377 million; three to five years—$2 million; more than five years—zero. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding/payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. As of December 29, 2007, assuming that all future milestones are met, additional required payments would be approximately $254 million. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the statutory withholding requirements that are paid by Intel on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the table above, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above are estimates based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone-based obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly. We have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of IMFT and IMFS in proportion to our investments, currently 49% in each of these ventures. However, IMFS is in its construction phase and has had no production to date. See “Note 19: Ventures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Additionally, we have entered into various contractual commitments in relation to our investments in IMFT and IMFS. Some of these commitments are with Micron, and some are directly with IMFT or IMFS. The following are the significant contractual commitments: • Subject to certain conditions, Intel and Micron each agreed to contribute up to approximately $1.4 billion for IMFT and up to approximately $1.7 billion for IMFS in the three years following the initial capital contributions. Of these amounts, as of December 29, 2007, our remaining commitments were approximately $260 million for IMFT and approximately $1.5 billion for IMFS. • We also have several agreements with Micron related to intellectual property rights, and R&D funding related to NAND flash manufacturing and IMFT. See “Note 19: Ventures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 29, 2007, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (Continued) Business Outlook Our future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular, our goals and strategies; new product introductions; plans to cultivate new businesses; pending divestitures; future economic conditions; revenue; pricing; gross margin and costs; capital spending; depreciation; R&D expenses; marketing, general and administrative expenses; potential impairment of investments; our effective tax rate; pending legal proceedings; net gains (losses) from equity investments; and interest and other, net. Our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount, type, and valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of award exercises by employees. We are focusing on efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may result in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our expectations for 2008 are as follows: • Gross margin: 57% plus or minus a few points. The 57% midpoint is higher than our 2007 gross margin of 51.9%, primarily due to expected lower unit costs and lower start-up costs, and to a lesser extent, the divestiture of lower margin businesses. • Capital spending: approximately $5.2 billion, plus or minus $200 million, compared to $5.0 billion in 2007. • Depreciation: approximately $4.4 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.5 billion in 2007. • Total spending: spending on R&D, plus marketing, general and administrative expenses in 2008 is expected to be approximately $11.4 billion. The expectation for total spending in 2008 is higher than our 2007 spending of $11.2 billion, as process development engineers transition from 45nm start-up activities to 32nm development, causing a movement of spending from cost of sales to R&D. • Research and development spending: approximately $5.9 billion. • Tax rate: approximately 31%. The estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at December 29, 2007 and current expected income. Status of Business Outlook We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the “Business Outlook” section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. At the same time, we will keep this Form 10-K and our most current business outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com. The public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in the “Business Outlook” and other forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. From the close of business on March 7, 2008 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 15, 2008, we will observe a “quiet period.” During the quiet period, the “Business Outlook” and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 15, 2008, as reiterated or updated as applicable, in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. We use derivative financial instruments primarily to mitigate these risks. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates We generally hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments with offsetting currency borrowings, currency forward contracts, or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in negligible net exposure. A majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan. To protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established balance sheet and anticipated transaction risk management programs. Currency forward contracts and currency options are generally utilized in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements (see “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 15% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $35 million at the end of 2007 and 2006. Interest Rates We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. To achieve this objective, the returns on all of our investments in debt instruments are generally based on three-month LIBOR, or, if the maturities are longer than three months, the returns are generally swapped into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. We considered the historical volatility of the interest rates experienced in prior years and the duration of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 80 basis points (0.80%), approximately 17% of the rate at December 29, 2007 (15% of the rate at December 30, 2006), could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 0.80% decrease in interest rates, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $65 million as of December 29, 2007 and $50 million as of December 30, 2006. The decline reflects only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment portfolio. Equity Prices Our marketable investments include marketable equity securities, equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options, and marketable equity method investments. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, including warrants, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. The marketable equity securities included in trading assets are held to generate returns that offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these equity securities are generally offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities, resulting in a net exposure of less than $10 million as of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, assuming a reasonably possible decline in market prices of approximately 10% in the near term. As of December 29, 2007, the fair value of our marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $1.0 billion ($427 million as of December 30, 2006). Our investments in VMware and Micron constituted 92% of our marketable equity securities as of December 29, 2007, and were carried at a fair market value of $794 million and $123 million, respectively. Our marketable equity method investment had a carrying value of $508 million and a fair value of $522 million as of December 29, 2007. 44 Table of Contents To assess the market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investments, we analyzed the historical movements over the past several years of high-technology stock indices that we considered appropriate. For our investments in companies that have been publicly traded for only a limited time, we analyzed the implied volatility of the related company based on freely traded options. Our marketable equity method investment is excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes. Therefore, the potential fair value decline would not be indicative of the impact on our financial statements, unless an other-than-temporary impairment was deemed necessary. Based on our sensitivity analysis, we estimated that it was reasonably possible that the prices of the stocks of our marketable equity securities could experience a loss of 55% in the near term (30% as of December 30, 2006). Assuming a loss of 55% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $565 million, based on the value as of December 29, 2007 (a decrease in value of $134 million, based on the value as of December 30, 2006 using an assumed loss of 30%). This estimate is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and actual results may differ materially. The increase in exposure from December 30, 2006 to December 29, 2007 is due to our purchase of VMware during 2007, its stock price volatility, and the weight of our investment in VMware in relation to our total marketable equity securities. Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot quantify the impact directly. Such a movement and the underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $805 million as of December 29, 2007 ($733 million as of December 30, 2006). The carrying amount of these investments approximated fair value as of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006. As of December 29, 2007, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $2.6 billion ($2.0 billion as of December 30, 2006) and consisted primarily of our investment in IMFT of $2.2 billion ($1.3 billion as of December 30, 2006). 45 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:52:51.191445
50863,INTC,INTEL CORP,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

Overview of contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments outstanding as of December 27, 2008, including expected payment schedule, and explanation of off-balance-sheet arrangements. • Business Outlook. Our expectations for selected financial items for the 2009 fiscal year. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements. Words such as “expects,” “goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “continues,” “may,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the “Business Outlook” section (see also “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 18, 2009. Overview Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. Our primary component-level products include microprocessors, chipsets, and flash memory. Net revenue, gross margin, operating income, and net income for 2008 and 2007 were as follows: (In Millions) 2008 2007 Net revenue $ 37,586 $ 38,334 Gross margin $ 20,844 $ 19,904 Operating income $ 8,954 $ 8,216 Net income $ 5,292 $ 6,976 The slowing of the worldwide economy resulted in a weak fourth quarter. The pace of the revenue decline in the fourth quarter was dramatic and resulted from reduced demand and inventory contraction across the supply chain. The 19% sequential decline from the third quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2008 was only the second time in the last 20 years that our fourth-quarter revenue fell below our third-quarter revenue. It is unclear when a turnaround may occur, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty around demand, which may continue to decline. However, we believe that our competitive position, manufacturing process technologies, cash flow from operations, and balance sheet remain strong, and that we are well positioned to manage through this economic downturn. We continue to invest in our leading-edge technologies and growth initiatives in order to strengthen our competitive position and enter new market segments. We have a strong belief that technology companies successfully emerge from recessions with tomorrow’s products, not today’s products. In 2008, we introduced the Intel Atom processor family, which is designed to enable new mobile Internet form factors at attractive system price points. Our product offerings continue to strengthen, with the launch of our new microarchitecture, code-named “Nehalem,” in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, we expect to begin manufacturing products using our next-generation 32nm process technology in the second half of 2009, which we believe will increase performance and energy efficiency, and lower product costs. 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our gross margin toward the end of the year was impacted by approximately $250 million of factory under-utilization charges as well as inventory write-offs on computing-related products, which were primarily demand-related. The under-utilization charges were a result of our decision to reduce factory loadings at the end of the fourth quarter in response to the drop-off in demand. As a result, factory under-utilization charges are expected to increase significantly in the first quarter, impacting our gross margin. We also expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted as our start-up costs associated with our 32nm process technology increase and as we transition 32nm design resources from research and development to manufacturing. Additionally, changes in demand levels and pricing of products could impact inventory write-offs, mix, and unit costs, creating additional variability in margin. Despite reducing our factory loadings, we increased our inventory in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to lower than expected demand and inventory reductions in the supply chain. We expect further reduction in the supply chain inventory levels in the first quarter of 2009 as our customers manage their business through the current economic uncertainty. Subsequent to the end of 2008, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations, and align our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity to current market conditions. These actions, which are expected to take place beginning in 2009, include closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. We continue to focus on our commitment to efficiency and controlling spending. We have reduced our headcount by over 2,000 from the end of 2007 and nearly 20,000 from our highest levels during 2006. During 2008, we had additional divestitures of non-strategic businesses and divested our NOR flash memory business. Also, in a joint decision with Micron, we discontinued the supply of NAND flash memory from a 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network, which resulted in restructuring charges of $215 million. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we made a $1.0 billion investment in Clearwire LLC, adding to our pre-existing investments. However, we recorded an impairment of our investments in the new Clearwire Corporation and Clearwire LLC of $938 million, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investments. From a financial condition perspective, we ended 2008 with an investment portfolio valued at $14.5 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets and short- and long-term investments. In addition, we generated $10.9 billion in cash from operations in 2008. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment, with other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale investments in debt instruments limited to $44 million during 2008. In addition, we continue to be able to invest in high-quality investments. However, we have seen a reduction in the volume of available commercial paper from certain market segments. As a result, our investments in short-term government funds have increased, which will reduce our average investment return. Despite the tightening of the credit markets, we continue to be able to access funds through the credit markets, including through the issuance of commercial paper. With the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments, we have not seen significant liquidation delays, and for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments. For additional details on our investment portfolio, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” During 2008, we repurchased $7.1 billion of stock through our stock repurchase program and paid $3.1 billion to stockholders as dividends. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we did not repurchase additional stock, as we felt that it was better to conserve cash, given the economic environment. In January 2009, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.14 per common share for the first quarter of 2009. 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. As part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment, we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our financial resources, global presence, and brand recognition. We believe that we have the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly. Some of our key focus areas are listed below: • Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized user computing solution compared to components that are used separately. • Architecture and Platforms. We are developing integrated platform solutions by moving the memory controller and graphics functionality from the chipset to the microprocessor. This platform repartitioning is designed to provide improved performance due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and reduced platform size. In addition, we are focusing on improved energy-efficient performance for computing and communications systems and devices. Improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing improved performance with lower power consumption. We continue to develop multi-core microprocessors with an increasing number of cores, which enable improved multitasking and energy efficiency. We are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable, many-core architecture aimed at parallel processing. This architecture will initially be used in developing discrete graphics processors designed for gaming and media creation. Over time, this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications. • Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. Our strategy for developing microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. We plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. This coordinated schedule allows us to develop and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for the next generation of silicon process technology. We refer to this as our “tick-tock” technology development cadence. • Strategic Investments. We make equity investments in companies around the world that we believe will generate returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business initiatives. Our investments, including those made through our Intel Capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. Our current investments focus on the following areas: advancing flash memory products, enabling mobile wireless devices, advancing the digital home, enhancing the digital enterprise, advancing high-performance communications infrastructures, and developing the next generation of silicon process technologies. Our focus areas and investment activities tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in the economic climate. • Business Environment and Software. We believe that we are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive innovation, foster collaboration, and promote industry standards that will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. We plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. We frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting organizations. In addition, we work collaboratively with other companies to protect digital content and the consumer. Lastly, through our Software and Services Group (SSG), we help enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. We believe that the proliferation of the Internet, including user demand for premium content and rich media, drives the need for greater performance in PCs and servers. A growing number of older PCs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users demand, such as streaming video, uploading photos, and online gaming. As these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power, we believe that users will need and want to buy new PCs to perform everyday tasks on the Internet. We also believe that increased Internet traffic creates a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance. 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units has continued, and shipments of our mobile microprocessors exceeded our desktop microprocessors for the first time in the second quarter of 2008. We believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors. Our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for new uses and form factors. We believe that these low-power microprocessors give us the ability to extend Intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments, including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded solutions, MIDs, consumer electronics devices, nettops, and netbooks. We believe that the common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the Internet. We also offer, and are continuing to develop, SoC products that integrate core processing functionality with specific components, such as graphics, audio, and video, onto a single chip to form a purpose-built solution. This integration reduces cost, power consumption, and size. Strategy by Operating Segment We completed a reorganization in the second quarter of 2008 that transferred the revenue and costs associated with a portion of the Digital Home Group’s consumer PC components business to the Digital Enterprise Group. The Digital Home Group now focuses on the consumer electronics components business. The strategy by operating segment presented below is based on the new organizational structure. The strategy for our Digital Enterprise Group (DEG) is to offer computing and communications products for businesses, service providers, and consumers. DEG products are incorporated into desktop and nettop computers, enterprise computer servers and workstations, and products that make up the infrastructure for the Internet. We also offer products for embedded designs, such as industrial equipment, point-of-sale systems, telecommunications, panel PCs, in-vehicle information/entertainment systems, and medical equipment. Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy-efficient performance while at the same time lowering total cost of ownership for businesses. For consumers in the desktop computing market segment, we also focus on the design of components for high-end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rich audio and video capabilities. Our strategy for the nettop computing market segment is to offer products that enable affordable, Internet-focused devices with small form factors. Our strategy for the enterprise computing market segment is to offer products that provide energy-efficient performance and virtualization technology for server, workstation, and storage platforms. We are also increasing our focus on products designed for high-performance computing, data centers, and blade server systems. Our strategy for the embedded computing market segment is to drive Intel architecture as an embedded solution by delivering long life cycle support, architectural scalability, and platform integration. The strategy for our Mobility Group is to offer notebook PC products designed to improve performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. We are also increasing our focus on products designed for the business and consumer environments by offering technologies that provide increased manageability and security, and we continue to invest in the build-out of WiMAX. We also offer, and are continuing to develop, products that enable mobile devices to deliver digital content and the Internet to users in new ways, including products for MIDs and netbooks. The strategy for our NAND Solutions Group is to offer advanced NAND flash memory products, focusing on system-level solutions for Intel architecture platforms such as solid-state drives. Additionally, we offer NAND products used in memory cards. In support of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products, we continue to focus on the development of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable, non-volatile, low-cost, high-density memory. The strategy for our Digital Home Group is to offer products and solutions, including SoC designs, for use in consumer electronics devices designed to access and share Internet, broadcast, optical media, and personal content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home. We are focusing on the design of components for consumer electronics devices, such as digital TVs, high-definition media players, and set-top boxes, which receive, decode, and convert incoming data signals. 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The strategy for our Digital Health Group is to design and deliver technology-enabled products and explore global business opportunities in healthcare information technology and healthcare research, as well as personal healthcare. In support of this strategy, we are focusing on the design of technology solutions and platforms for the digital hospital and consumer/home health products. The strategy for our Software and Services Group is to promote Intel architecture as the platform of choice for software and services. SSG works with the worldwide software and services ecosystem by providing software products, engaging with developers, and driving strategic software investments. Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: • the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments, net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments; • the valuation of investments in debt instruments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other, net when we record impairments of available-for-sale debt instruments; • the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation; • the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and • the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as those for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors; however, these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. Non-Marketable Equity Investments The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $4.1 billion as of December 27, 2008 ($3.4 billion as of December 29, 2007). The majority of the balance as of December 27, 2008 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment and wireless connectivity market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in IMFT of $1.7 billion ($2.2 billion as of December 29, 2007), our investment in IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) of $329 million ($146 million as of December 29, 2007), and our investment in Numonyx of $484 million. Our wireless connectivity market segment investments include our non-marketable investment in Clearwire LLC of $238 million (see “Note 5: Available-for-Sale Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on our additional marketable equity investment in the new Clearwire Corporation of $148 million). In addition, we regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. For additional information, see “Note 6: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted historical cost basis or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment (see “Note 2: Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and a number of the companies in which we invest are likely to fail. Their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. Depending on their future prospects, the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our investments would likely become impaired. Additionally, the current financial markets are extremely volatile and there has been a tightening of the credit markets, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, including those specific to our investments in the flash memory market segment and wireless connectivity market segment, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment; however, for non-marketable equity investments, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment. The indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances primarily include: • the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects; • the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies; • the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; • factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and • the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. Investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value. If the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on the severity and duration of the impairment. If the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Beginning in the first quarter of 2008, the assessment of fair value for non-marketable investments is based on the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157), as amended. With the exception of Clearwire LLC, we classified our impaired non-marketable investments as Level 3, as we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement, and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. We classified our investment in Clearwire LLC as Level 2, as the unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology were not significant to the fair value measurement. See “Note 3: Fair Value” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $1.2 billion in 2008. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2008, impairments of non-marketable equity investments have ranged from $10 million to $896 million per quarter. The following is a discussion of the methods, estimates, and judgments that management uses in our analysis to determine if our non-marketable equity investments are other than temporarily impaired. IMFT/IMFS IMFT and IMFS are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell NAND products to Intel and Micron at manufacturing cost. Our NAND Solutions Group operating segment purchases 49% of these NAND products from IMFT and sells them to our customers. As a result, we generate cash flows from our investments in IMFT, IMFS, and our intangible assets related to the NAND product designs through our NAND Solutions Group business. Therefore, we determine the fair value of our investments in IMFT and IMFS using the income approach, based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our NAND Solutions Group business. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The discounted cash flow scenarios require the use of unobservable inputs, including assumptions of projected revenues (including product volume, product mix, and average selling prices), expenses, capital spending, and other costs, as well as a discount rate. Estimates of projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by IMFT, IMFS, and Intel using historical data and available market data. Management also determines how multiple discounted cash flow scenarios are weighted in the fair value determination. Additionally, the development of several inputs used in our income model (such as discount rate and tax rate) requires the selection of comparable companies within the NAND flash memory market segment. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including NAND products and services lines within the flash memory market segment, comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, and other relevant factors. Based on our fair value determination, the fair value of our investment in IMFT and IMFS approximated carrying value as of December 27, 2008. Changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs would change the valuation of the investment. The estimates for the projected revenue and discount rate are the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination. For example, the impact of a 5% decline in projected revenue in each of our cash flow scenarios could result in a decline in the fair value of our investment of up to approximately $300 million. The impact of a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline in the fair value of our investment of approximately $225 million. The fair value determined by the income approach is compared to the carrying value of our investments in IMFT and IMFS and our intangible asset related to the NAND product designs that we purchased from Micron as part of the formation of IMFT. We did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investments in IMFT and IMFS in 2008, 2007, or 2006. Numonyx We determine the fair value of our investment in Numonyx using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach includes the use of a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of Numonyx, which requires the use of unobservable inputs, including assumptions of projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other costs, as well as a discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment. Estimates of projected revenues, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by Numonyx and Intel. The market approach includes using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, expenses, and other costs. The selection of comparable companies used in the market approach requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including NOR products and services lines within the flash memory market segment, comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, and other relevant factors. Changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs in our valuation models would change the valuation of the investment. The estimated projected revenue is the assumption that most significantly affects the fair value determination. For example, the impact of a 5% decline in projected revenue to each of our models and cash flow scenarios could result in a decline in the fair value of our investment of up to approximately $140 million. Management judgment is involved in determining how the income approach and the market approach are weighted in the fair value determination. Our fair value determination was more heavily weighted toward the market approach due to the comparability of similar companies in the market and the availability of market-based data. Increasing the relative weighting of the income approach would have resulted in a decline in the fair value of our investment by approximately $30 million. We recorded a $250 million impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx during the third quarter of 2008 to write down our investment to its fair value. Estimates for revenue, earnings, and future cash flows were revised lower due to a general decline in the NOR flash memory market segment. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Clearwire LLC We determine the fair value of our investment in Clearwire LLC primarily using the quoted prices of its parent company, the new Clearwire Corporation. The effects of adjusting the quoted price for premiums that we believe market participants would consider for Clearwire LLC, such as tax benefits and voting rights associated with our investment, were mostly offset by the effects of discounts to the fair value, such as those due to transfer restrictions, lack of liquidity, and differences in dividend rights that are included in the value of the new Clearwire Corporation stock. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a $176 million impairment charge on our available-for-sale marketable investment in the new Clearwire Corporation due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment. Other Non-Marketable Equity Investments We determine the fair value of our other non-marketable equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, products and services lines, development stage, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of market segment size, market segment share, and costs are developed by the investee and/or Intel using historical data and available market data. The valuation of our other non-marketable investments also takes into account movements of the equity and venture capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, changes in the interest rate environment, the investee’s capital structure, liquidation preferences for the investee’s capital, and other economic variables. The valuation of some of our investments in the wireless connectivity market segment was based on the income approach to determine the value of the investee’s spectrum licenses, transmission towers, and customer lists. We recorded a total of $200 million of impairment charges in 2008 on our other non-marketable equity investments. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2008, impairments of our other non-marketable equity investments have ranged from $10 million to $134 million per quarter. Investments in Debt Instruments Fair Value In the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be difficult and subjective. The volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined, and the rapid changes occurring in today’s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time. SFAS No. 157 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value (see “Note 3: Fair Value” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Level 1 instruments represent quoted prices in active markets. Therefore, determining fair value for Level 1 instruments does not require significant management judgment, and the estimation is not difficult. 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Level 2 instruments include observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), issuer credit ratings, non-binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data, model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities, or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. These Level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to Level 1 instruments, including: • Determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced requires management to identify a sample of similar securities based on the coupon rates, maturity, issuer, credit rating, and instrument type, and subjectively select an individual security or multiple securities that are deemed most similar to the security being priced. • Determining whether a market is considered active requires management judgment. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument. • Determining which model-derived valuations to use in determining fair value requires management judgment. When observable market prices for identical securities or similar securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow models, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. Most of our marketable debt instruments classified as Level 3 are valued using a non-binding market consensus price or a non-binding broker quote, both of which we corroborate with unobservable data. Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs, and to a lesser degree non-observable market inputs. Adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes, and classified as Level 3, were not significant in 2008. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment After determining the fair value of our available-for-sale debt instruments, gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. Determining whether the decline in fair value is other-than-temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment. For investments in debt instruments, these judgments primarily consider: the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer, the issuer’s credit rating, and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full; and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity. Given the current market conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations. In addition, if management decides not to hold an investment until maturity, it may result in the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment. As of December 27, 2008, our investments included $11.3 billion of available-for-sale debt instruments. During 2008, we recognized $44 million in impairment charges on our available-for-sale debt instruments. As of December 27, 2008, our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $215 million (approximately $55 million as of December 29, 2007). As of December 27, 2008, this amount included approximately $170 million of unrecognized losses that could be recognized in the future if our other-than-temporary assessment changes. 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Long-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value, based on the best information available, including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis. Impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2008, impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $1 million to $320 million per quarter. For further discussion on these asset impairment charges, see “Note 15: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are measured at fair value only when indicators of impairment exist. The accounting and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for these assets beginning in the first quarter of 2009. For further discussion, see “Note 2: Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Income Taxes We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. In 2008, we recorded gross additional valuation allowances of approximately $270 million, primarily related to our anticipated inability to take the full tax benefit of impairment charges. Changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of SFAS No. 109,” and related guidance, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled and effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 27, 2008, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1,577 million and total finished goods inventory of $1,559 million. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Changes For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see “Note 2: Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: 2008 2007 2006 % of % of % of (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Net revenue $ 37,586 100.0 % $ 38,334 100.0 % $ 35,382 100.0 % Cost of sales 16,742 44.5 % 18,430 48.1 % 17,164 48.5 % Gross margin 20,844 55.5 % 19,904 51.9 % 18,218 51.5 % Research and development 5,722 15.2 % 5,755 15.0 % 5,873 16.6 % Marketing, general and administrative 5,458 14.6 % 5,417 14.2 % 6,138 17.3 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges 710 1.9 % 516 1.3 % 555 1.6 % Operating income 8,954 23.8 % 8,216 21.4 % 5,652 16.0 % Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net (1,380 ) (3.7 )% 3 — % 2 — % Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net (376 ) (1.0 )% 154 0.4 % 212 0.6 % Interest and other, net 488 1.3 % 793 2.1 % 1,202 3.4 % Income before taxes 7,686 20.4 % 9,166 23.9 % 7,068 20.0 % Provision for taxes 2,394 6.3 % 2,190 5.7 % 2,024 5.7 % Net income $ 5,292 14.1 % $ 6,976 18.2 % $ 5,044 14.3 % Diluted earnings per share $ 0.92 $ 1.18 $ 0.86 The following graphs set forth revenue information of geographic regions for the periods indicated: Geographic Breakdown of Revenue Our net revenue was $37.6 billion in 2008, a decrease of 2% compared to 2007. Higher revenue from the sale of microprocessors and chipsets was more than offset by the impacts of divestitures and lower revenue from the sale of motherboards. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory and cellular baseband products declined approximately $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of divestiture of these businesses. Revenue in the Americas region decreased 4% in 2008 compared to 2007. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Japan regions remained approximately flat in 2008 compared to 2007. 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Although net revenue for 2008 declined only slightly from 2007, net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 declined 19% from the third quarter as customers reduced inventory levels to keep pace with the dramatic decline in end-user demand that occurred over the course of the quarter. It is unclear when a turnaround may occur, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty around demand, which may continue to decline. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2008 were $20.8 billion, an increase of $940 million, or 5%, compared to 2007. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 55.5% in 2008 from 51.9% in 2007. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the Digital Enterprise Group operating segment. In addition, our gross margin percentage increased due to the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in 2008 and 2007 from the sale of microprocessors in the Digital Enterprise Group and Mobility Group operating segments. See “Business Outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations. Our net revenue was $38.3 billion in 2007, an increase of 8% compared to 2006. Higher microprocessor unit sales were partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices. Higher mobile chipset unit sales also contributed to the increase in net revenue. Lower NOR flash memory revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 was mostly offset by the ramp of our NAND flash memory business. The decrease in NOR flash memory revenue was due to a significant decline in average selling prices. Lower royalty revenue was offset by higher unit sales. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 11% and revenue in the Europe region increased 10% in 2007 compared to 2006, and revenue in the Americas region and Japan increased 3% in 2007 compared to 2006. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2007 were $19.9 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion, or 9%, compared to 2006. Our overall gross margin percentage was relatively flat at 51.9% in 2007 compared to 51.5% in 2006. The gross margin percentage increase in the Digital Enterprise Group operating segment was mostly offset by a decrease in the gross margin percentage in the Mobility Group operating segment and costs associated with the ramp of our NAND flash memory business. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in 2007 and 2006 from the sale of microprocessors in the Digital Enterprise Group and Mobility Group operating segments. Digital Enterprise Group The revenue and operating income for the Digital Enterprise Group (DEG) for the three years ended December 27, 2008 were as follows: (In Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Microprocessor revenue $ 16,078 $ 15,945 $ 15,248 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 4,554 5,359 5,437 Net revenue $ 20,632 $ 21,304 $ 20,685 Operating income $ 6,462 $ 5,295 $ 3,299 Net revenue for the DEG operating segment decreased by $672 million, or 3%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Microprocessors within DEG include those designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher enterprise microprocessor average selling prices and higher embedded microprocessor unit sales, partially offset by lower desktop microprocessor unit sales. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower motherboard unit sales and lower revenue from the sale of communications products. In addition, lower chipset average selling prices were partially offset by higher chipset unit sales. Operating income increased by $1.2 billion, or 22%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to lower desktop microprocessor and chipset unit costs. Lower start-up costs of approximately $350 million and lower operating expenses were partially offset by sales in 2007 of desktop microprocessors that had previously been written off and higher write-offs of desktop microprocessor inventory in 2008. 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For 2007, net revenue for the DEG operating segment increased by $619 million, or 3%, compared to 2006. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor unit sales and higher enterprise average selling prices. These increases were partially offset by lower desktop average selling prices in a competitive pricing environment. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to lower motherboard unit sales as well as a decrease in communications infrastructure revenue, which was primarily due to divestitures of certain communications infrastructure businesses that were completed in 2006 and 2007. Partially offsetting these decreases was higher chipset revenue. Operating income increased by $2.0 billion, or 61%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to lower desktop microprocessor unit costs and lower operating expenses, and to a lesser extent, sales of desktop microprocessor inventory that had been previously written off. Partially offsetting these increases were higher chipset unit costs and approximately $500 million of higher start-up costs, primarily related to our 45nm process technology. In 2007, we began including share-based compensation in the computation of operating income (loss) for each operating segment and adjusted the 2006 operating segment results to reflect this change. Mobility Group The revenue and operating income for the Mobility Group (MG) for the three years ended December 27, 2008 were as follows: (In Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Microprocessor revenue $ 11,439 $ 10,660 $ 9,212 Chipset and other revenue 4,209 4,021 3,097 Net revenue $ 15,648 $ 14,681 $ 12,309 Operating income $ 5,199 $ 5,611 $ 4,602 Net revenue for the MG operating segment increased by $967 million, or 7%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly higher microprocessor unit sales, which were partially offset by significantly lower microprocessor average selling prices. A portion of the increase in microprocessor unit sales, as well as a portion of the decrease in average selling prices, was due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The increase in chipset and other revenue was primarily due to significantly higher chipset unit sales, which were partially offset by lower revenue from the sale of cellular baseband products. We are winding down the sales from the manufacturing agreement entered into as part of the divestiture of the cellular baseband business. Operating income decreased by $412 million, or 7%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher operating expenses, which were partially offset by lower microprocessor unit costs. For 2007, net revenue for the MG operating segment increased by $2.4 billion, or 19%, compared to 2006. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to a significant increase in unit sales, partially offset by significantly lower average selling prices. The increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher unit sales of chipsets and, to a lesser extent, higher revenue from sales of cellular baseband products. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we sold certain assets of the business line that included application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices; however, in 2007 we continued to manufacture and sell those products as part of a manufacturing and transition services agreement. Operating income increased by $1.0 billion, or 22%, in 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue. Lower microprocessor unit costs were more than offset by approximately $330 million of higher start-up costs, primarily related to our 45nm process technology. Lower unit costs on wireless connectivity and cellular baseband products were offset by higher chipset unit costs. Operating expenses were higher in 2007 compared to 2006; however, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2007 compared to 2006. 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 27, 2008 were as follows: (In Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Research and development $ 5,722 $ 5,755 $ 5,873 Marketing, general and administrative $ 5,458 $ 5,417 $ 6,138 Restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 710 $ 516 $ 555 Research and Development. R&D spending was flat in 2008 compared to 2007 and decreased $118 million, or 2%, in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2008 compared to 2007, we had lower product development expenses resulting from our divested businesses and slightly lower profit-dependent compensation. These decreases were offset by higher process development costs as we transition from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 45nm process technology to research and development of our next-generation 32nm process technology. The decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower process development costs as we transitioned from R&D to manufacturing using our 45nm process technology, partially offset by higher profit-dependent compensation. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses were flat in 2008 compared to 2007 and decreased $721 million, or 12%, in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2008 compared to 2007, we had higher legal expenses that were offset by lower profit-dependent compensation and lower advertising expenses. The decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower headcount, lower share-based compensation, and lower cooperative advertising expenses, partially offset by higher profit-dependent compensation. R&D, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in 2008, 29% of net revenue in 2007, and 34% of net revenue in 2006. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 27, 2008: (In Millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 NAND plan $ 215 $ — $ — 2006 efficiency program 495 516 555 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 710 $ 516 $ 555 We may incur additional restructuring charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements, and facility-related or other exit activities. Subsequent to the end of 2008, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations, and align our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity to current market conditions. These actions, which are expected to take place beginning in 2009, include closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. Our outlook for the first quarter of 2009 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of $160 million. 2008 NAND Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved a plan with Micron to discontinue the supply of NAND flash memory from the 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network. The agreement resulted in a $215 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the IMFT 200mm supply agreement. The restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in IMFT of $184 million, a cash payment to Micron of $24 million, and other cash payments of $7 million. 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2006 Efficiency Program The following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended December 27, 2008: (In Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 151 $ 289 $ 238 Asset impairments 344 227 317 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 495 $ 516 $ 555 In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions recommended by our structure and efficiency task force as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. Some of these activities have involved cost savings or other actions that did not result in restructuring charges, such as better utilization of assets, reduced spending, and organizational efficiencies. The efficiency program has included targeted headcount reductions for various groups within the company, which we have met through employee attrition and terminations. Business divestures have further reduced headcount. During 2006, we completed the divestiture of three businesses. For further discussion, see “Note 12: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In connection with the divestiture of certain assets of our communications and application processor business, we recorded impairment charges of $103 million related to the write-down of manufacturing tools to their fair value, less the cost to dispose of the assets. We determined the fair value using a market-based valuation technique. In addition, as a result of both this divestiture and a subsequent assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This plan resulted in an impairment charge of $214 million to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment asset grouping that has been principally used to support our communications and application processor business. We determined the fair market value of the asset grouping using an average of the results from using the cost approach and market approach valuation techniques. During 2007, we incurred an additional $54 million in asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility. Also, we recorded land and building write-downs related to certain facilities in Santa Clara, California. In addition, we incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business. We determined the impairment charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture. During 2008, we incurred additional asset impairment charges related to the Colorado Springs facility, based on market conditions. Also, we incurred $275 million in additional asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business. We determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs. The lower fair value was primarily a result of a decline in the outlook for the flash memory market segment. For further information on this divestiture, see “Note 12: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2007 and 2008: Employee Severance (In Millions) and Benefits Asset Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 30, 2006 $ 48 $ — $ 48 Additional accruals 299 227 526 Adjustments (10 ) — (10 ) Cash payments (210 ) — (210 ) Non-cash settlements — (227 ) (227 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2007 $ 127 $ — $ 127 Additional accruals 167 344 511 Adjustments (16 ) — (16 ) Cash payments (221 ) — (221 ) Non-cash settlements — (344 ) (344 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 57 $ — $ 57 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment charges. The remaining accrual as of December 27, 2008 was related to severance benefits that we recorded within accrued compensation and benefits. From the third quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of 2008, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. These charges included a total of $678 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 11,900 employees, of which 10,800 employees had left the company as of December 27, 2008. A substantial majority of these employee terminations affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. Of the employee severance and benefit charges incurred as of December 27, 2008, we had paid $621 million. The restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $888 million in asset impairment charges. We estimate that employee severance and benefit charges from the third quarter of 2006 to the fourth quarter of 2008 will result in gross annual savings of approximately $1.1 billion, a portion of which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2006. We are realizing these savings within marketing, general and administrative expenses; cost of sales; and R&D. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $851 million in 2008, $952 million in 2007, and $1.4 billion in 2006. Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. The decrease in share-based compensation from 2006 to 2007 was a result of fewer equity awards vesting in 2007 compared to 2006. As of December 27, 2008, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: Unrecognized Share-Based Weighted Compensation Average (Dollars in Millions) Costs Period Stock options $ 335 1.2 years Restricted stock units $ 937 1.4 years Stock purchase plan $ 18 1 month Gains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments, Net Net losses on equity method investments were $1.4 billion in 2008 compared to a net gain of $3 million in 2007. We recognized higher impairment charges and higher equity method losses in 2008 compared to 2007. Impairment charges in 2008 included a $762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire LLC and a $250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Numonyx. We recognized the impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment. The impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx was due to a general decline in the NOR flash memory market segment. Our equity method losses were primarily related to Numonyx ($87 million in 2008) and the old Clearwire Corporation ($184 million 2008 and $104 million in 2007). See “Note 6: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net gains on equity method investments were flat in 2007 compared to 2006. Approximately $110 million of income recognized in 2007 due to the reorganization of one of our investments was offset by higher equity method losses, primarily from our investment in the old Clearwire Corporation. Equity method losses were not significant in 2006. 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains (Losses) on Other Equity Investments, Net Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Impairment charges $ (455 ) $ (92 ) $ (72 ) Gains on sales 60 204 151 Other, net 19 42 133 Total gains (losses) on other equity investments, net $ (376 ) $ 154 $ 212 Net losses on other equity investments were $376 million in 2008 compared to a net gain of $154 million in 2007. We recognized higher impairment charges and lower gains on sales in 2008 compared to 2007. Impairment charges in 2008 included a $176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in the new Clearwire Corporation and $97 million of impairment charges on our investment in Micron. The impairment charge on our investment in the new Clearwire Corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment. The impairment charges on our investment in Micron reflect the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in Micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008, and were principally based on our assessment of Micron’s financial results and the competitive environment. Net gains on other equity investments were $154 million in 2007 compared to $212 million in 2006. During 2007, we recognized lower gains on third-party merger transactions and higher impairment charges, partially offset by higher gains on sales of equity investments. Net gains on equity investments in 2006 included a gain of $103 million on the sale of a portion of our investment in Micron, which was sold for $275 million. Interest and Other, Net The components of interest and other, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 592 $ 804 $ 636 Interest expense (8 ) (15 ) (24 ) Other, net (96 ) 4 590 Total interest and other, net $ 488 $ 793 $ 1,202 Interest and other, net decreased to $488 million in 2008 compared to $793 million in 2007. The decrease was due to lower interest income and fair value losses that we experienced in 2008 on our trading assets. Interest income was lower in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. Interest and other, net decreased to $793 million in 2007 compared to $1.2 billion in 2006, primarily due to lower divestiture gains, partially offset by higher interest income resulting primarily from higher average investment balances, and to a lesser extent higher interest rates. Results for 2006 included net gains of $612 million for three divestitures. See “Note 12: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Provision for Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 31.1% in 2008 (23.9% in 2007 and 28.6% in 2006). The rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. In addition, the rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007, due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $481 million (including $50 million of accrued interest) related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the first and second quarters of 2007. Our effective income tax rate was lower in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to the settlements with the IRS. 44 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, short-term investments, marketable debt instruments included in trading assets, and debt at the end of each period were as follows: Dec. 27, Dec. 29, (Dollars in Millions) 2008 2007 Cash, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets $ 11,544 $ 14,871 Short-term and long-term debt $ 1,988 $ 2,122 Debt as % of stockholders’ equity 5.1 % 5.0 % In summary, our cash flows were as follows: (In Millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,926 $ 12,625 $ 10,632 Net cash used for investing activities (5,865 ) (9,926 ) (4,988 ) Net cash used for financing activities (9,018 ) (1,990 ) (6,370 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,957 ) $ 709 $ (726 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2008 compared to 2007, the $1.7 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $1.7 billion decrease in net income, while total adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities, including net changes in assets and liabilities, were approximately flat. Inventories as of December 27, 2008 increased compared to December 29, 2007, due to higher chipset and microprocessor inventories partially offset by lower inventories of other products. As of December 27, 2008, our other accrued liabilities included $447 million in customer credit balances, which were reclassified from accounts receivable. Accounts receivable as of December 27, 2008 decreased significantly compared to December 29, 2007, due to a significant decline in revenue during the last month in the fourth quarter of 2008. Customer credit balances were not significant as of December 29, 2007. For 2008, our two largest customers accounted for 38% of our net revenue (35% in 2007). In 2008, one of these customers accounted for 20% of our net revenue (17% in 2007), and another customer accounted for 18% of our net revenue (18% in 2007). Additionally, these two largest customers accounted for 46% of our accounts receivable as of December 27, 2008 (35% as of December 29, 2007). Due to the adoption of SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159), in 2008, the related cash flows for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets are now included in investing activities. For 2007 compared to 2006, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income. Changes to working capital in 2007 from 2006 were approximately flat, with a decrease in inventory levels compared to an increase in 2006, offset by higher purchases of trading assets exceeding maturities. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, maturities, and disposals. The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments. In addition, due to the adoption of SFAS No. 159 in 2008, the related cash flows for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets were included in investing activities for 2008, and previously they had been included in operating activities. Our investments in non-marketable equity investments were higher in 2008 and included $1.0 billion for an ownership interest in Clearwire LLC. 45 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our capital expenditures were $5.2 billion in 2008 ($5.0 billion in 2007 and $5.9 billion in 2006). Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009 are currently expected to be flat to slightly down from our 2008 expenditures. Capital expenditures during fiscal year 2009 are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities. The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher purchases of available-for-sale investments. Lower capital spending was mostly offset by lower proceeds from divestitures. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. The higher cash used in financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock, and lower proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. During 2008, we repurchased $7.2 billion of common stock compared to $2.8 billion in 2007. As of December 27, 2008, $7.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to $3.1 billion in 2007, as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options. Our dividend payment was $3.1 billion in 2008, higher than the $2.6 billion in 2007, due to increases in quarterly cash dividends per common share. On January 23, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.14 per common share for the first quarter of 2009. The lower cash used in financing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans and a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. As of December 27, 2008, we also had an investment portfolio valued at $14.5 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets and short- and long-term investments. Our investment policy requires all investments with original maturities of up to 6 months to be rated at least A-1/P-1 by Standard & Poor’s/Moody’s, and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities. For instance, investments with maturities of greater than three years require a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 at the time of investment. Government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, or the absence of A rated counterparties in certain countries, result in some minor exceptions. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and the majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa2 or better. Additionally, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty’s relative credit standing. As of December 27, 2008, the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed $500 million. Credit rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments. The amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which a counterparty’s obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty, because we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions subject to International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) agreements. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment, with other-than-temporary impairments on our available-for-sale debt instruments limited to $44 million during 2008. In addition, we continue to be able to invest in high-quality investments. However, we have seen a reduction in the volume of available commercial paper from certain market segments. As a result, our investments in short-term government funds have increased, which will reduce our average investment return. With the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized other-than-temporary impairments, we have not seen significant liquidation delays, and for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments. We have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested, which may occur at or near the maturity of those investments. 46 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As of December 27, 2008, $10.2 billion of our portfolio had a remaining maturity of less than one year. As of December 27, 2008, our cumulative unrealized losses, net of corresponding hedging activities, related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were approximately $145 million (approximately $25 million as of December 29, 2007). As of December 27, 2008, our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were approximately $215 million (approximately $55 million as of December 29, 2007). Substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment that resulted in a decrease in the market liquidity for debt instruments. Our portfolio included $1.1 billion of asset-backed securities as of December 27, 2008. Approximately half of these securities were collateralized by first-lien mortgages or credit card debt. The remaining asset-backed securities were collateralized by student loans or auto loans. During 2008, our asset-backed securities experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling $131 million, of which $108 million was recognized in our consolidated statements of income. As of December 27, 2008, the expected weighted average remaining maturity was less than two years. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our Board of Directors. We intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary. Based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2008 were approximately $1.3 billion, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 27, 2008. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s as of December 27, 2008. Despite the tightening of the credit markets, we continue to be able to access funds through the credit markets, including through the issuance of commercial paper. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity, working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. Fair Value Beginning in the first quarter of 2008, the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments was based on the provisions of SFAS No. 157. SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis. When fair value is determined using observable market prices, the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument. When fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk and/or Intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate. During 2008, the valuation of our liabilities measured at fair value as well as our derivative instruments in a current or potential net liability position were not impacted by changes in our credit risk. The credit ratings of certain of our counterparties have deteriorated. However, the deterioration of these credit ratings did not have a significant impact on the valuation of either our marketable debt instruments or derivative instruments in a current or potential net asset position. 47 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) When values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of the instruments being measured, we classify those instruments as Level 3 under the SFAS No. 157 hierarchy. As of December 27, 2008, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $15.0 billion of assets, of which $1.7 billion (11%) were classified as Level 3. In addition, our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $421 million of liabilities, of which $147 million (35%) were classified as Level 3. During 2008, we transferred approximately $680 million of assets from Level 3 to Level 2. These assets primarily consisted of floating-rate notes that were transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 due to a greater availability of observable market data and/or non-binding market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of our instruments. During 2008, we recognized an insignificant amount of losses on the assets that were transferred from Level 3 to Level 2. During 2008, the Level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling $160 million. Of these declines, $111 million was recognized in our consolidated statements of income. We believe that the remaining $49 million, included in other comprehensive income, represents a temporary decline in the fair value of available-for-sale investments. During 2008, we did not experience any significant realized gains (losses) related to the Level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 27, 2008, our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $14.2 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, approximately $525 million was classified as Level 1, approximately $12.0 billion as Level 2, and approximately $1.6 billion as Level 3. When available, we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments. If observable market prices are not available, we use non-binding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data, if available, or non-observable market data. When prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument, we use observable market quotes to price our instruments, in lieu of prices from other sources. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. Marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our floating-rate notes, corporate bonds, and money market fund deposits. Management judgment was required to determine our policy that defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument. Approximately 10% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using: non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a lesser degree non-observable market inputs. We corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. Approximately 45% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model, approximately 40% due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data, and approximately 5% due to the usage of quoted market prices for similar instruments. Marketable debt instruments classified as Level 2 generally include commercial paper, bank time deposits, municipal bonds, certain of our money market fund deposits, and a majority of floating-rate notes and corporate bonds. 48 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. Marketable debt instruments in this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our floating-rate notes and corporate bonds. All of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as Level 3, and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities. Money Market Fund Deposits As of December 27, 2008, our marketable debt instruments included $422 million of money market fund deposits. Of these money market fund deposits, $373 million was classified as Level 1 and $49 million was classified as Level 2. Equity Securities As of December 27, 2008, our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $352 million of marketable equity securities. Of these securities, $308 million was classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for each individual security, including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security. The fair values of our investments in the new Clearwire Corporation ($148 million) and VMware, Inc. ($137 million) constituted most of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as Level 1. Our investment in VMware was reclassified from Level 2 to Level 1 during 2008, due to the expiration of our transfer restriction on VMware stock. The remaining marketable equity securities ($44 million) were classified as Level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions. The fair value of our investment in Micron ($42 million) constituted substantially all of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as Level 2. In measuring the fair value of our investment in Micron, our valuation reflected a discount from the quoted market price of Micron’s stock, due to our investment being in a form of rights exchangeable into unregistered Micron stock. As of December 27, 2008, our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $299 million of equity securities offsetting deferred compensation. All of these securities were classified as Level 1, because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. 49 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 27, 2008: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than (In Millions) Total 1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 350 $ 106 $ 130 $ 68 $ 46 Capital purchase obligations1 2,862 2,782 80 — — Other purchase obligations and commitments2 1,180 492 554 9 125 Long-term debt obligations3 3,382 80 272 108 2,922 Other long-term liabilities3, 4, 5 645 260 157 98 130 Total6 $ 8,419 $ 3,720 $ 1,193 $ 283 $ 3,223 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 27, 2008, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. 2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses, agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent total anticipated cash payments, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the short-term portion of the obligation. Any future settlement of convertible debt would reduce anticipated interest and/or principal payments. Amounts exclude fair value adjustments such as discounts or premiums that affect the amount recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. 4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $736 million of income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above. However, long-term income taxes payable, included on our consolidated balance sheet, includes these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits. 5 Other long-term liabilities in the table above include the short-term portion of other long-term liabilities. Expected contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $67 million to be made during 2009 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2009 are not practical to estimate. 6 Total generally excludes contractual obligations already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The table above also includes agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. For other obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the table above were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms and/or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the table above. We estimate our obligation under these agreements as of December 27, 2008 to be approximately as follows: less than one year—$309 million; one to three years—$315 million; three to five years—zero; more than five years—zero. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. 50 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding/payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. As of December 27, 2008, assuming that all future milestones are met, additional required payments would be approximately $150 million. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the statutory withholding requirements paid by Intel on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the table above, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above are estimates based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone-based obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly. We have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of IMFT and IMFS in proportion to our investments, currently 49% in each of these ventures. However, IMFS is in its construction phase and has had no production to date. See “Note 6: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Additionally, we have entered into various contractual commitments in relation to our investments in IMFT and IMFS. Some of these commitments are with Micron, and some are directly with IMFT or IMFS. The following are the significant contractual commitments: • Subject to certain conditions, Intel and Micron each agreed to contribute up to approximately $1.7 billion for IMFS in the three years following the initial capital contribution. Of that amount, as of December 27, 2008, our remaining commitment was approximately $1.3 billion. However, the construction of the IMFS fabrication facility has been placed on hold. • We also have several agreements with Micron related to intellectual property rights, and R&D funding related to NAND flash manufacturing and IMFT. See “Note 6: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 27, 2008, with the exception of a guarantee for the repayment of $275 million in principal of the payment obligations of Numonyx under its senior credit facility, as well as accrued unpaid interest, expenses of the lenders, and penalties, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. See “Note 6: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 51 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Business Outlook Our future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular, current economic uncertainty, including the tightening of credit markets, as well as future economic conditions; our goals and strategies; new product introductions; plans to cultivate new businesses; divestitures or investments; revenue; pricing; gross margin and costs; capital spending; depreciation; R&D expenses; marketing, general and administrative expenses; potential impairment of investments; our effective tax rate; pending legal proceedings; net gains (losses) from equity investments; and interest and other, net. The current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters, and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from our expectations. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our expectations for 2009 are as follows: • Total Spending. We expect spending on R&D, plus marketing, general and administrative expenses, in 2009 to be between $10.4 billion and $10.6 billion. This expectation for our total spending in 2009 is lower than our 2008 spending by approximately 6% due to targeted spending reductions, lower spending for revenue and profit-dependent items, and the standard shift between R&D and cost of sales spending as we ramp our new 32nm process technology. • Research and Development Spending. Approximately $5.4 billion. • Capital Spending. We expect capital spending in 2009 to be flat to slightly down from capital spending in 2008 of $5.2 billion. We expect capital spending for 2009 to primarily consist of investments in 32nm process technology. • Depreciation. Approximately $4.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million. • Tax Rate. Approximately 27%. The estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect as of December 27, 2008 and expected income. Status of Business Outlook We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the “Business Outlook” section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. At the same time, we will keep this Form 10-K and our most current business outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com. The public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in the “Business Outlook” and other forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. From the close of business on February 27, 2009 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 14, 2009, we will observe a “quiet period.” During the quiet period, the “Business Outlook” and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 15, 2009, as reiterated or updated as applicable, in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to financial market risks, primarily changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk, and to a lesser extent, equity market risk and commodity price risk. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 27, 2008 and December 29, 2007. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates We generally hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments with offsetting currency borrowings, currency forward contracts, or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure. A majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements (see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $55 million at the end of 2008 (less than $35 million at the end of 2007, using a weighted average adverse change of 15% in currency exchange rates). The weighted average adverse change increased from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008, due to a higher relative weighting of more volatile currencies. Interest Rates We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. To achieve this objective, the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on three-month LIBOR, or, if the maturities are longer than three months, the returns are generally swapped into U.S. dollar three-month LIBOR-based returns. The current financial markets are extremely volatile. A hypothetical 1.0% decrease in interest rates, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $135 million as of December 27, 2008 and $80 million as of December 29, 2007. The hypothetical 1.0% interest rate decrease would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately $150 million as of December 27, 2008 and would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $15 million as of December 27, 2008 (an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately $95 million as of December 29, 2007 and an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $15 million as of December 29, 2007). The fluctuations in fair value of our debt issuances and investment portfolio reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment portfolio. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see “Fair Value” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, including warrants, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. 53 Table of Contents The marketable equity securities included in trading assets are held to generate returns that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity and other market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these equity securities are offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities. Assuming a decline in market prices of approximately 25%, our net exposure to loss was approximately $40 million as of December 27, 2008 and approximately $20 million as of December 29, 2007. As of December 27, 2008, the fair value of our available-for-sale marketable equity securities and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $362 million ($1.0 billion as of December 29, 2007). Our investments in the new Clearwire Corporation, VMware, and Micron constituted 90% of our marketable equity securities as of December 27, 2008, and were carried at a fair market value of $148 million, $137 million, and $42 million, respectively. The current equity markets are extremely volatile. Assuming a loss of 60% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $220 million, based on the value as of December 27, 2008 (a decrease in value of $565 million, based on the value as of December 29, 2007 using an assumed loss of 55%). The increase in the assumed loss percentage from December 29, 2007 to December 27, 2008 is due to a higher relative weighting of more volatile investments. Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. The current financial markets are extremely volatile and there has been a tightening of the credit markets, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2008 ($805 million as of December 29, 2007). As of December 27, 2008, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $3.0 billion ($2.6 billion as of December 29, 2007). Most of the balance as of December 27, 2008 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment and wireless connectivity market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment of $1.7 billion in IMFT ($2.2 billion as of December 29, 2007), $329 million in IMFS ($146 million as of December 29, 2007), and $484 million in Numonyx. Our wireless connectivity market segment investments include our non-marketable equity method investment in Clearwire LLC of $238 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information appearing under the heading ""Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations"" on pages 36 through 41 of our 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated by reference. In January 2001, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xircom, Inc and in March we successfully completed the tender offer. Xircom is a supplier of PC cards and other products used to connect mobile computing devices to corporate networks and the Internet. In February 2001, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held VxTel Inc. for approximately $550 million in a cash transaction. VxTel develops Voice-over-Packet products that deliver high-quality voice and data communications over next-generation optical networks. The completion of this acquisition is subject to regulatory review and normal closing conditions.

Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 22, 2010. Overview Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. Our primary component-level products include microprocessors, chipsets, and flash memory. To better align our major product groups around the core competencies of Intel architecture and our manufacturing operations, we completed the reorganization of our business in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net revenue, gross margin, operating income, and net income for the fourth and third quarters of 2009, and fiscal year 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 26, Sept. 26, Dec. 26, Dec. 27, (In Millions) 2009 2009 2009 2008 Net revenue $ 10,569 $ 9,389 $ 35,127 $ 37,586 Gross margin $ 6,840 $ 5,404 $ 19,561 $ 20,844 Operating income $ 2,497 $ 2,579 $ 5,711 $ 8,954 Net income $ 2,282 $ 1,856 $ 4,369 $ 5,292 We started the year in one of the deepest recessions in our history and emerged from it with better products and technology in a strengthening market. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, revenue was down 26% in the first quarter of 2009, with the second and third quarters down 15% and 8%, respectively, compared to the second and third quarters of 2008. However, our fourth quarter results reflected a strengthening demand across all regions and all product categories, driven primarily by the notebook market segment. Fourth quarter revenue of $10.6 billion was up 13% compared to the third quarter, nearly twice the seasonal average, and up 28% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. 25 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The launch of our microprocessor products using 32nm process technology was strong in the fourth quarter and was one of the contributors to the increase in our overall microprocessor average selling prices compared to the third quarter. Our server products also had a strong quarter, and we saw a demand shift toward higher end products, which also contributed to the increase in our average selling prices. Despite these fourth quarter increases, our microprocessor average selling prices in 2009 were lower than in 2008, driven primarily by decreases in average selling prices in the notebook and desktop market segments. With the launch of our 32nm products and fourth quarter record shipments of microprocessor units, we are entering 2010 in a strong competitive position as we continue delivering improvements in our product offerings through the “tick-tock” manufacturing process technology and product development cadence. Additionally, our Intel Atom processors and related chipsets continue their strong ramp, with revenue having increased nearly $900 million in 2009 compared to 2008. We believe our total inventory levels of $2.9 billion, though up compared to the third quarter of 2009, are appropriate based on our forecasts. We believe that OEM component inventories are roughly flat compared to the third quarter and below levels at the end of 2008. Additionally, our distributors’ inventories are down compared to the third quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin percentage of 64.7% set a new quarterly record. The fourth quarter gross margin percentage compared to the third quarter was positively impacted by lower inventory write-offs, higher microprocessor average selling prices and unit sales, the lack of excess capacity charges, and improving unit costs. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect our gross margin percentage to decrease due to higher unit costs as we continue to ramp our 32nm products, as well as seasonally lower microprocessor unit sales and lower microprocessor average selling prices. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we made a $1.25 billion payment to AMD as part of a settlement to end all outstanding litigation between the companies, including antitrust litigation and cross-license patent disputes. Also in the fourth quarter of 2009, the New York Attorney General and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed antitrust suits against Intel. For further information on our litigation matters, see “Note 28: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. From a financial condition perspective, we ended 2009 with an investment portfolio of $13.9 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments. During 2009, we generated $11.2 billion in cash from operations despite paying the €1.06 billion ($1.447 billion) European Commission fine recorded in the second quarter of 2009, and the AMD settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. During 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of convertible debt and utilized the proceeds from the convertible debt to repurchase $1.7 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. In addition, during 2009 we returned $3.1 billion to stockholders through dividends. In January 2010, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.1575 per common share for the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 12.5% compared to our fourth quarter dividend. In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all-stock transaction. For further information, see “Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 26 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. As part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment, we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our financial resources, global presence, brand recognition, and software development. We believe that we have the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly. Some of our key focus areas are listed below: • Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized computing solution compared to components that are used separately. • Architecture and Platforms. We are focusing on improved energy-efficient performance for computing and communications systems and devices. Improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing improved performance with lower power consumption. We continue to develop multi-core microprocessors with an increasing number of cores, which enable improved multitasking and energy efficiency. In addition, to meet the demands of new and evolving netbook, consumer electronics, and various embedded market segments, we offer and are continuing to develop SoC products that are designed to provide improved performance due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and smaller form factors. • Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. Our strategy for developing microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. We plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. This coordinated schedule allows us to develop and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for the next generation of silicon process technology. We refer to this as our “tick-tock” technology development cadence. In keeping with this cadence, we expect to introduce a new microarchitecture using our 32nm process technology in 2010. • Strategic Investments. We make investments in companies around the world that we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business initiatives. Our investments, including those made through our Intel Capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. Our current investments primarily focus on the following areas: advancing flash memory products, enabling mobile wireless devices, advancing the digital home, enhancing the digital enterprise, advancing high-performance communications infrastructures, and developing the next generation of silicon process technologies. • Business Environment and Software. We believe that we are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive innovation, foster collaboration, and promote industry standards that will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. We plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. We frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards-setting organizations. Through our Software and Services Group, we help enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. Lastly, we believe that the software expertise of our Wind River Software Group in the embedded and handheld market segments will expedite our growth strategy in these market segments. We believe that the proliferation of the Internet, including user demand for premium content and rich media, drives the need for greater performance in PCs and servers. Older PCs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that businesses and individual consumers demand, such as streaming video, web conferencing, online gaming, and other memory-intensive applications. As these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power, we believe that businesses and individual consumers will need and want to buy new PCs. We also believe that increased Internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing, in which a group of linked servers provide a variety of applications and data to users over the Internet, create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization. 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We believe that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units will continue and that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low-power microprocessors. We also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers, as a growing number of households have multiple devices for different computing functions. Our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low-power microprocessors for these and other new uses and form factors. We believe that Intel Atom processors give us the ability to extend Intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments, including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded applications, handhelds, consumer electronics devices, and netbooks. We expect that our Intel Atom Developer Program will spur new applications that run on products using Intel Atom processors, which will expedite our growth strategy in these new market segments. The common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the Internet. We are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable, many-core architecture aimed at parallel processing, the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task. This architecture will initially be used as a software development platform for graphics and throughput computing (the need for large amounts of computing performance consistently over a long period of time). Over time, this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as high-performance computing applications. In addition, we offer, and are continuing to develop, advanced NAND flash memory products, focusing on system-level solutions for Intel architecture platforms such as solid-state drives. In support of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products, we continue to focus on the development of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable, non-volatile, low-cost, high-density memory. Strategy by Major Market Segment The strategy for our PC Client Group operating segment is to offer products that are incorporated into notebook, netbook, and desktop computers for consumers and businesses. Our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook PC products designed to improve performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. We are also increasing our focus on notebook products designed to offer technologies that provide increased manageability and security, and we continue to invest in the build-out of WiMAX. Our strategy for the netbook computing market segment is to offer products that enable affordable, Internet-focused devices with small form factors. Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy-efficient performance while lowering total cost of ownership for businesses. For consumers in the desktop computing market segment, we also focus on the design of components for high-end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rich audio and video capabilities. The strategy for our Data Center Group operating segment is to offer products that provide leading performance, energy-efficiency, and virtualization technology for server, workstation, and storage platforms. We are also increasing our focus on products designed for high-performance and mission-critical computing, cloud computing services, and emerging markets. In addition, we offer wired connectivity devices that are incorporated into products that make up the infrastructure for the Internet. The strategies for our other Intel architecture operating segments include: • driving Intel architecture as a solution for embedded applications by delivering long life-cycle support, software and architectural scalability, and platform integration; • continuing to develop and offer products that enable handhelds to deliver digital content and the Internet to users in new ways; and • offering products and solutions for use in consumer electronics devices designed to access and share Internet, broadcast, optical media, and personal content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home. 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: • the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments, net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments; • the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation; • the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and • the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $3.4 billion as of December 26, 2009 ($4.1 billion as of December 27, 2008). The majority of this balance as of December 26, 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in IMFT and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) of $1.6 billion ($2.1 billion as of December 27, 2008). For further information, see “Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment (see “Note 2: Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our non-marketable equity investments are classified in other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and a number of the companies in which we invest could fail. Their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. Depending on their future prospects, the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our investments would likely become impaired. Additionally, financial markets and credit markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of market segment size, market segment share, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by the investee and/or Intel using historical data and available market data. The valuation of our non-marketable investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees’ capital structure, and differences in seniority and rights associated with the investees’ capital. 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: • the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; • the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies; • the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; • factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and • the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $221 million in 2009. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2009, impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $11 million to $896 million per quarter. This range included impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC). IMFT/IMFS IMFT and IMFS are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell NAND products to Intel and Micron at manufacturing cost. We determine the fair value of our investment in IMFT/IMFS using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our NAND Solutions Group business, which requires the use of unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. Changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination. We did not have an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in IMFT/IMFS in 2009, 2008, or 2007. It is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term, which could result in an impairment of our investment. Long-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2009, impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $40 million to $300 million per quarter. For further discussion on these asset impairment charges, see “Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 26, 2009, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1,469 million and total finished goods inventory of $1,029 million. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. In order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings of wafers compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Over the past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter. Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see “Note 3: Accounting Changes” and “Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: 2009 2008 2007 % of % of % of (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Net revenue $ 35,127 100.0 % $ 37,586 100.0 % $ 38,334 100.0 % Cost of sales 15,566 44.3 % 16,742 44.5 % 18,430 48.1 % Gross margin 19,561 55.7 % 20,844 55.5 % 19,904 51.9 % Research and development 5,653 16.1 % 5,722 15.2 % 5,755 15.0 % Marketing, general and administrative 7,931 22.6 % 5,452 14.6 % 5,401 14.1 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges 231 0.6 % 710 1.9 % 516 1.3 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 35 0.1 % 6 — % 16 0.1 % Operating income 5,711 16.3 % 8,954 23.8 % 8,216 21.4 % Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net (147 ) (0.4 )% (1,380 ) (3.7 )% 3 — % Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net (23 ) (0.1 )% (376 ) (1.0 )% 154 0.4 % Interest and other, net 163 0.4 % 488 1.3 % 793 2.1 % Income before taxes 5,704 16.2 % 7,686 20.4 % 9,166 23.9 % Provision for taxes 1,335 3.8 % 2,394 6.3 % 2,190 5.7 % Net income $ 4,369 12.4 % $ 5,292 14.1 % $ 6,976 18.2 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.77 $ 0.92 $ 1.18 The following graphs set forth revenue information of geographic regions for the periods indicated: Geographic Breakdown of Revenue Our net revenue for 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008. Average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased and microprocessor and chipset unit sales increased, compared to 2008, primarily due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors and chipsets, which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory products and communications products declined $740 million, primarily as a result of business divestitures. Additionally, an increase in revenue from the sale of NAND flash memory products was mostly offset by a decrease in revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 2% compared to 2008, while revenue in the Europe, Japan, and Americas regions decreased by 26%, 15%, and 4%, respectively, compared to 2008. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2009 decreased $1.3 billion, or 6%, compared to 2008. Our overall gross margin percentage increased slightly to 55.7% in 2009 from 55.5% in 2008. The slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increases in the NAND Solutions Group and Data Center Group operating segments offset by the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group operating segment. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2009, and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008, from the sales of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. See “Business Outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations. Our net revenue for 2008 decreased 2% compared to 2007. Higher revenue from the sale of microprocessors and chipsets was more than offset by the impacts of divestitures and lower revenue from the sale of motherboards. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory and cellular baseband products declined $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of divestiture of these businesses. Revenue in the Americas region decreased 4% in 2008 compared to 2007. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Japan regions remained approximately flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2008 were $20.8 billion, an increase of $940 million, or 5%, compared to 2007. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 55.5% in 2008 from 51.9% in 2007. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the PC Client Group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, the gross margin percentage increase in the Data Center Group operating segment. In addition, our gross margin percentage increased due to the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008 and 2007 from the sale of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group (PCCG) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Microprocessor revenue $ 19,914 $ 21,516 $ 21,053 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 6,261 6,450 6,077 Net revenue $ 26,175 $ 27,966 $ 27,130 Operating income $ 7,585 $ 9,419 $ 8,535 Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.8 billion, or 6%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Microprocessors and chipsets within PCCG include those designed for the notebook, netbook, and desktop computing market segments. The decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices, and lower desktop microprocessor unit sales and average selling prices. These decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in netbook microprocessor unit sales due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices and lower unit sales of wireless connectivity products, partially offset by higher chipset unit sales. Operating income decreased by $1.8 billion, or 19%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue and approximately $810 million of higher factory underutilization charges, partially offset by lower chipset and microprocessor unit costs. For 2008, net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased slightly by $836 million, or 3%, compared to 2007. The increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to significantly higher notebook microprocessor unit sales, partially offset by significantly lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices. In addition, lower desktop microprocessor unit sales were partially offset by the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to higher chipset unit sales, partially offset by lower desktop motherboard unit sales. Operating income increased by $884 million, or 10%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to lower microprocessor and chipset unit costs, partially offset by lower desktop microprocessor and chipset revenue and higher operating expenses. In addition, approximately $230 million of lower start-up costs were offset by sales in 2007 of desktop microprocessors that had previously been written off, and higher write-offs of desktop microprocessor inventory in 2008. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group (DCG) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Microprocessor revenue $ 5,301 $ 5,126 $ 4,796 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 1,149 1,464 1,659 Net revenue $ 6,450 $ 6,590 $ 6,455 Operating income $ 2,299 $ 2,135 $ 2,105 Net revenue for the DCG operating segment decreased slightly by $140 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices, partially offset by lower microprocessor unit sales. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices. Operating income increased by $164 million, or 8%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by approximately $150 million of higher start-up costs as well as lower chipset revenue. For 2008, net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased slightly by $135 million, or 2%, compared to 2007. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower motherboard unit sales. Operating income was flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Higher revenue was mostly offset by higher operating expenses. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income for the other Intel architecture operating segments (Other IA) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net revenue $ 1,402 $ 1,763 $ 1,908 Operating income (loss) $ (179 ) $ (63 ) $ 47 Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $361 million, or 20%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and operating loss for the Other IA operating segments increased by $116 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The changes were primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within the Embedded and Communications Group (ECG), primarily as a result of business divestitures. For 2008, net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $145 million, or 8%, compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within ECG, primarily as a result of business divestitures, partially offset by higher ECG microprocessor unit sales. Operating income (loss) decreased by $110 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses within the Ultra-Mobility Group and, to a lesser extent, within the Digital Home Group. 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Research and development $ 5,653 $ 5,722 $ 5,755 Marketing, general and administrative $ 7,931 $ 5,452 $ 5,401 Restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 231 $ 710 $ 516 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles $ 35 $ 6 $ 16 Research and Development. R&D spending was flat in 2009 compared to 2008, and was flat in 2008 compared to 2007. In 2009 compared to 2008, we had lower process development costs as we transitioned from R&D to manufacturing using our 32nm process technology. This decrease was offset by higher profit-dependent compensation expenses. In 2008 compared to 2007, we had lower product development expenses resulting from our divested businesses and slightly lower profit-dependent compensation. These decreases were offset by higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 45nm process technology to R&D of our 32nm process technology. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $2.5 billion, or 45%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and were flat in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) and the $1.25 billion payment to AMD as part of a settlement agreement (see “Note 28: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). To a lesser extent, we had higher profit-dependent compensation expenses that were partially offset by lower advertising expenses, including cooperative advertising expenses. In 2008 compared to 2007, we had higher legal expenses that were offset by lower profit-dependent compensation and lower advertising expenses. R&D, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 39% of net revenue in 2009, 30% of net revenue in 2008, and 29% of net revenue in 2007. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 26, 2009: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 restructuring program $ 215 $ — $ — 2008 NAND plan — 215 — 2006 efficiency program 16 495 516 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 231 $ 710 $ 516 2009 Restructuring Program In the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations. These plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. We do not expect significant future charges related to the 2009 plan. The following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009: (In Millions) 2009 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 208 Asset impairments 7 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 215 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009: Employee Severance Asset (In Millions) and Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ — $ — $ — Additional accruals 223 7 230 Adjustments (15 ) — (15 ) Cash payments (182 ) — (182 ) Non-cash settlements — (7 ) (7 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 26 $ — $ 26 The net charges above include $208 million that relate to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 6,500 employees, of which 5,400 employees had left the company as of December 26, 2009. Most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing. We estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges will result in gross annual savings of approximately $290 million. The substantial majority of the savings will be realized within cost of sales. 2008 NAND Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved a plan with Micron to discontinue the supply of NAND flash memory from the 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network. The agreement resulted in a $215 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the IMFT 200mm supply agreement. The restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in IMFT/IMFS of $184 million, a cash payment to Micron of $24 million, and other cash payments of $7 million. The 2008 NAND plan was completed at the end of 2008. 2006 Efficiency Program In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. The following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended December 26, 2009: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 8 $ 151 $ 289 Asset impairments 8 344 227 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 16 $ 495 $ 516 During 2006, as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a result of placing the facility for sale, in 2006 we recorded a $214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment. We incurred $54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008. We sold the Colorado Springs facility in 2009. In addition, during 2007 we recorded land and building write-downs related to certain facilities in Santa Clara, California. We also incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business in 2007 and an additional $275 million in 2008. We determined the impairment charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007, and determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs, in 2008. For further information on this divestiture, see “Note 16: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2008 and 2009: Employee Severance Asset (In Millions) and Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2007 $ 127 $ — $ 127 Additional accruals 167 344 511 Adjustments (16 ) — (16 ) Cash payments (221 ) — (221 ) Non-cash settlements — (344 ) (344 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 57 $ — $ 57 Additional accruals 18 8 26 Adjustments (10 ) — (10 ) Cash payments (65 ) — (65 ) Non-cash settlements — (8 ) (8 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ — $ — $ — We recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment charges. The 2006 efficiency plan is complete. From the third quarter of 2006 through 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. These charges included a total of $686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11,300 employees. A substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. The restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $896 million in asset impairment charges. We estimate that the total employee severance and benefit charges incurred as part of the 2006 efficiency program result in gross annual savings of approximately $1.1 billion. We are realizing these savings within marketing, general and administrative; cost of sales; and R&D. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The increase of $29 million was due to amortization of intangibles primarily related to the acquisition of Wind River Systems completed in the third quarter of 2009. See “Note 15: Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $889 million in 2009, $851 million in 2008, and $952 million in 2007. Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 26, 2009, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: Unrecognized Share-Based Weighted Compensation Average (Dollars in Millions) Costs Period Stock options $ 282 1.3 years Restricted stock units $ 1,196 1.4 years Stock purchase plan $ 9 1 month 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments, Net Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Equity method losses, net $ (131 ) $ (316 ) $ (103 ) Impairment charges (42 ) (1,077 ) (28 ) Other, net 26 13 134 Total gains (losses) on equity method investments, net $ (147 ) $ (1,380 ) $ 3 Impairment charges in 2008 included a $762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire LLC and a $250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Numonyx. We recognized the impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment in the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx was due to a general decline in 2008 in the NOR flash memory market segment. Our equity method losses were primarily related to Numonyx ($31 million in 2009 and $87 million in 2008), Clearwire LLC ($27 million in 2009), and Clearwire Corporation ($184 million in 2008 and $104 million in 2007). See “Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2007, we recognized $110 million of income due to the reorganization of one of our investments, included within “Other, net” in the table above. Gains (Losses) on Other Equity Investments, Net Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Impairment charges $ (179 ) $ (455 ) $ (92 ) Gains on sales, net 55 60 204 Other, net 101 19 42 Total gains (losses) on other equity investments, net $ (23 ) $ (376 ) $ 154 Impairment charges in 2008 included a $176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire Corporation and $97 million of impairment charges on our investment in Micron. The impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charges on our investment in Micron reflected the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in Micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008. In addition, we recognized higher gains on equity derivatives in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and Other, Net The components of interest and other, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 168 $ 592 $ 804 Interest expense (1 ) (8 ) (15 ) Other, net (4 ) (96 ) 4 Total interest and other, net $ 163 $ 488 $ 793 We recognized lower interest income in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower interest rates. The average interest rate earned during 2009 decreased by 2.4 percentage points compared to 2008. In addition, lower gains on divestitures (zero in 2009 and $59 million in 2008) were more than offset by $70 million of fair value gains in 2009 on our trading assets, compared to $130 million of fair value losses in 2008. 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Interest and other, net decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower interest income and fair value losses that we experienced in 2008 on our trading assets. Interest income was lower in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. The average interest rate earned during 2008 decreased by 1.9 percentage points compared to 2007. Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Income before taxes $ 5,704 $ 7,686 $ 9,166 Provision for taxes $ 1,335 $ 2,394 $ 2,190 Effective tax rate 23.4 % 31.1 % 23.9 % We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, the 2009 tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions compared to a reversal of $103 million for such matters in 2008. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine of $1.447 billion with no associated tax benefit. In addition, our 2008 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. Our effective income tax rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. In addition, the rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007, due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $481 million (including $50 million of accrued interest) related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the first and second quarters of 2007. Business Outlook Our future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular: • changes in business and economic conditions; • revenue and pricing; • gross margin and costs; • pending legal proceedings; • our effective tax rate (including changes in unrecognized tax positions); • marketing, general and administrative expenses; • our goals and strategies; • new product introductions; • plans to cultivate new businesses; • R&D expenses; • divestitures or investments; • net gains (losses) from equity investments; • interest and other, net; • capital spending; • depreciation; and • impairment of investments. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our expectations for 2010 are as follows: • Gross Margin Percentage. 61%, plus or minus three points. The 61% midpoint is higher than our 2009 gross margin of 55.7%, primarily due to lower manufacturing period costs, mostly factory underutilization charges. In addition, we expect lower unit costs and higher unit sales, partially offset by lower average selling prices. • Total Spending. We expect spending on R&D, plus marketing, general and administrative expenses, in 2010 to be approximately $11.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $13.6 billion in 2009. Total spending in 2009 included charges of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the EC and $1.25 billion as a result of our legal settlement with AMD. • Research and Development Spending. Approximately $6.2 billion compared to $5.7 billion in 2009. • Capital Spending. Approximately $4.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.5 billion in 2009. • Depreciation. Approximately $4.4 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.7 billion in 2009. • Tax Rate. Approximately 30%, compared to 23% in 2009. The estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect as of December 26, 2009 and expected income. 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Status of Business Outlook We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the “Business Outlook” section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. At the same time, we will keep this Form 10-K and our most current business outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com.

The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (Dollars in Millions) Dec. 26, 2009 Dec. 27, 2008 Cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments $ 13,920 $ 11,544 Loans receivable and other long-term investments $ 4,528 $ 2,924 Short-term and long-term debt $ 2,221 $ 1,287 Debt as % of stockholders’ equity 5.3 % 3.3 % Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) In summary, our cash flows were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,170 $ 10,926 $ 12,625 Net cash used for investing activities (7,965 ) (5,865 ) (9,926 ) Net cash used for financing activities (2,568 ) (9,018 ) (1,990 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 637 $ (3,957 ) $ 709 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2009 compared to 2008, the $244 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower net income. Income taxes paid, net of refunds in 2009 compared to 2008 were $3.1 billion lower on lower income before taxes and timing of payments. Changes in assets and liabilities for 2009 compared to 2008 included the following: • Inventories decreased due to lower chipset and raw materials inventory. • Accounts payable decreased due to timing of payments, despite higher production spending. • Accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue and a higher proportion of sales at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009. • Accrued compensation and benefits increased due to higher accrued profit-dependent compensation. For 2009 and 2008, our two largest customers accounted for 38% of our net revenue, with one of these customers accounting for 21% of our net revenue in 2009 (20% in 2008), and another customer accounting for 17% of our net revenue in 2009 (18% in 2008). These two largest customers accounted for 41% of our accounts receivable as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008. For 2008 compared to 2007, the $1.7 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $1.7 billion decrease in net income, while total adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities, including net changes in assets and liabilities, were approximately flat. Effective 2008, cash flows related to marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets are included in investing activities. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, maturities, disposals, and cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets, and higher cash paid for acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in investments in non-marketable equity investments. Our investments in non-marketable equity investments in 2008 included $1.0 billion for an ownership interest in Clearwire LLC. Our capital expenditures were $4.5 billion in 2009 ($5.2 billion in 2008 and $5.0 billion in 2007). Capital expenditures for 2010 are currently expected to be higher than our 2009 expenditures and are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale debt investments. In addition, the related cash flows for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets were included in investing activities for 2008, and previously they had been included in operating activities. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock and the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans. We used the majority of the proceeds from the 2009 issuance of long-term debt to repurchase and retire common stock. During 2009, we repurchased $1.8 billion of common stock compared to $7.2 billion in 2008. As of December 26, 2009, $5.7 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $400 million in 2009 compared to $1.1 billion in 2008 as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options. Our total dividend payments in 2009 remained flat from 2008 at $3.1 billion. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 69 quarters. In January 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1575 per common share for the first quarter of 2010. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2010 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2010. The higher cash used in financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock, and lower proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. As of December 26, 2009, cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments totaled $13.9 billion. In addition to the $13.9 billion, we have $4.5 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high, with credit-related other-than-temporary impairment losses on our available-for-sale debt instruments limited to less than $55 million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008. In addition, we continue to be able to invest in high-credit-quality investments. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. As of December 26, 2009, cumulative unrealized gains, net of corresponding hedging activities, related to debt instruments classified as trading assets, and cumulative unrealized gains related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, were insignificant. As of December 27, 2008, our cumulative unrealized losses, net of corresponding hedging activities, related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were $145 million. As of December 27, 2008, our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available-for-sale were $215 million. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2009 were $610 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 26, 2009. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s as of December 26, 2009. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. See “Note 5: Fair Value” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis. When fair value is determined using observable market prices, the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument. When fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk and/or Intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate. 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 26, 2009, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $17.5 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $657 million was classified as Level 1, $15.8 billion as Level 2, and $1.1 billion as Level 3. When available, we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments. If observable market prices are not available, we use non-binding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data, if available, or unobservable market data. When prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument, we use observable market quotes to price our instruments, in lieu of prices from other sources. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. Marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our corporate bonds, government bonds, and money market fund deposits. Management judgment was required to determine the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument. Approximately 10% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical and/or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and, to a lesser degree, unobservable market inputs. We corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR-based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. Approximately 40% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data, and approximately 50% due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model. Marketable debt instruments classified as Level 2 generally include commercial paper, bank time deposits, municipal bonds, certain of our money market fund deposits, and a majority of corporate bonds and government bonds. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. Marketable debt instruments in this category generally include asset-backed securities and certain of our corporate bonds. All of our investments in asset-backed securities were classified as Level 3, and substantially all of them were valued using non-binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset-backed securities. Equity Securities As of December 26, 2009, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $773 million of marketable equity securities. Of these securities, $676 million was classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one-month period prior to the valuation date for each individual security, including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security. The remaining marketable equity securities of $97 million were classified as Level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security-specific restrictions. 44 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 26, 2009: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than (In Millions) Total 1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 349 $ 102 $ 149 $ 60 $ 38 Capital purchase obligations1 1,836 1,760 76 — — Other purchase obligations and commitments2 866 290 403 48 125 Long-term debt obligations3 7,253 284 238 238 6,493 Other long-term liabilities4, 5 593 230 153 97 113 Total6 $ 10,897 $ 2,666 $ 1,019 $ 443 $ 6,769 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2009, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. Capital purchase obligations decreased from $2.9 billion as of December 27, 2008 to $1.8 billion as of December 26, 2009, primarily due to the timing of the ramp of our latest silicon process technology. 2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. 4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $193 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above. However, long-term income taxes payable, included on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income. 5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $60 million to be made during 2010 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2010 are not practical to estimate. 6 Total generally excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The table above also includes agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. For other obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the table above were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms and/or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the table above. We estimate our obligation under these agreements as of December 26, 2009 to be approximately as follows: less than one year—$364 million; one to three years—$3 million; more than three years—zero. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. 45 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above. These obligations include contingent funding/payment obligations and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. Assuming that all future milestones are met, additional required payments related to these obligations were not significant as of December 26, 2009. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the table above, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. We have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of IMFT in proportion to our investments, 49% as of December 26, 2009. We also have several agreements with Micron related to intellectual property rights, and R&D funding related to NAND flash manufacturing and IMFT. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFT’s inventory was $100 million as of December 26, 2009. See “Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above are estimates based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 26, 2009, with the exception of a guarantee for the repayment of $275 million in principal of the payment obligations of Numonyx under its senior credit facility, as well as accrued unpaid interest, expenses of the lenders, and penalties, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all-stock transaction. The senior credit facility that is supported by Intel’s guarantee is expected to be repaid in full following the closing of this transaction. See “Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and to a lesser extent, equity market and commodity price risk. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates We generally hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with offsetting currency forward contracts, currency options, or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue and a majority of our expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements (see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $40 million as of December 26, 2009 (less than $55 million as of December 27, 2008). Interest Rates We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. To achieve this objective, the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately $205 million as of December 26, 2009 (an increase of approximately $150 million as of December 27, 2008). A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $10 million as of December 26, 2009 (an increase of approximately $15 million as of December 27, 2008). These hypothetical decreases in interest rates, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $195 million as of December 26, 2009 and $135 million as of December 27, 2008. The fluctuations in fair value of our debt issuances and investment portfolio reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment portfolio. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, including warrants, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. 47 Table of Contents As of December 26, 2009, the fair value of our marketable equity securities and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $805 million ($362 million as of December 27, 2008). Our marketable equity securities include our investments in Clearwire Corporation and Micron, carried at a fair market value of $250 million and $148 million, respectively, as of December 26, 2009. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 50% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $405 million, based on the value as of December 26, 2009 (a decrease in value of approximately $220 million, based on the value as of December 27, 2008 using an assumed loss of 60%). The decrease in the assumed loss percentage from December 27, 2008 to December 26, 2009 is due to lower expected overall equity market volatility. Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets and credit markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $939 million as of December 26, 2009 ($1.0 billion as of December 27, 2008). As of December 26, 2009, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $2.5 billion ($3.0 billion as of December 27, 2008). A substantial majority of this balance as of December 26, 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment of $1.6 billion in IMFT/IMFS ($2.1 billion as of December 27, 2008) and $453 million in Numonyx ($484 million as of December 27, 2008). In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all-stock transaction. The value of the Micron common stock that we would receive upon the closing of the transaction is subject to equity market risk. For further information, see “Note 11: Non-Marketable Equity Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 48 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:53:13.104462

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. MD&A is organized as follows: • Overview. Discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the company in order to provide context for the remainder of MD&A. • Strategy. Our overall strategy and the strategy for our major market segments. • Critical Accounting Estimates. Accounting estimates that we believe are most important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts. • Results of Operations. An analysis of our financial results comparing 2010 to 2009 and comparing 2009 to 2008. • Business Outlook. Our expectations for selected financial items for 2011. • Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity. • Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Discussion of the methodologies used in the valuation of our financial instruments. • Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. Overview of contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off-balance-sheet arrangements outstanding as of December 25, 2010, including expected payment schedule. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements. Words such as “expects,” “goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the “Business Outlook” section and in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially, and other than our expected completion of the McAfee acquisition in the first quarter of 2011 (see “Note 15: Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K), these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 18, 2011. Overview Our results of operations were as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 25, Sept. 25, Dec. 25, Dec. 26, (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2010 2010 2009 Net revenue $ 11,457 $ 11,102 $ 43,623 $ 35,127 Gross margin $ 7,406 $ 7,321 $ 28,491 $ 19,561 Gross margin percentage 64.6 % 65.9 % 65.3 % 55.7 % Operating income $ 4,023 $ 4,136 $ 15,588 $ 5,711 Net income $ 3,180 $ 2,955 $ 11,464 $ 4,369 2010 was a record year for us. Strong market growth in the business and consumer PC market segments as well as the continued build-out of the data center, the leadership of our product portfolio, and improvements to our cost structure all contributed to the most profitable year in our history. Revenue increased 24% in 2010 compared to 2009. Our 2010 gross margin percentage of 65.3% increased by 9.6 percentage points from 2009, primarily driven by lower factory underutilization charges, higher microprocessor average selling prices, lower platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit cost, and higher platform unit sales. We expect continued strength in emerging markets coupled with the build-out of the cloud computing infrastructure to contribute toward a 2011 revenue growth percentage in the mid- to high-teens. This expectation is also inclusive of the recently completed acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon and the expected acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record quarterly revenue for the third quarter in a row despite continuation of the softness we saw in the consumer segments of mature markets starting in the middle of the year. The sequential decrease in our fourth quarter gross margin percentage was primarily driven by charges to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel® 6 Series Express Chipset family (see “Note 20: Chipset Design Issue” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K), increased costs associated with taking older technology offline, and higher start-up costs. These impacts were partially offset by the qualification for sale of our 2nd generation Intel® Coretm processor products (formerly code-named Sandy Bridge), resulting in lower microprocessor inventory write-offs and sales of previously written-off products, and higher platform average selling prices. 24 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As we enter 2011, the strength of our product portfolio is highlighted with the launch of 32nm process technology products based on our 2nd generation Intel Core processor microarchitecture. We continue to deliver improvements in our product offerings through our “tick-tock” technology development cadence. We plan to invest $9.0 billion in capital assets in 2011 as we build and equip our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity, which will increase our leading-edge facilities to four. This increase in capital spending will enable us to take advantage of the significant market growth opportunities that we believe exist for our products across the computing spectrum, as well as move more transistors to our leading-edge process technologies. The cash-generating power of our business was evident in 2010 with $16.7 billion of cash from operations. From a financial condition perspective, we ended 2010 with an investment portfolio of $21.5 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets. During 2010, we purchased $5.2 billion in capital assets, returned $3.5 billion to stockholders through dividends, and repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. In January 2011, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.1812 per common share for the first quarter of 2011, an increase of approximately 15% compared to our fourth quarter dividend, and increased the repurchase authorization limit of our common stock repurchase program by $10 billion. During 2010, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire McAfee for approximately $7.68 billion, and we expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011. For further information, see “Note 15: Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon. Total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. For further information, see “Note 15: Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In January 2011, we entered into a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. Under the agreement, we receive a license to all of NVIDIA’s patents, while NVIDIA products are licensed to our patents subject to exclusions for x86 products, certain chipsets, and certain flash memory technology products. The agreement also includes settlement of the existing litigation between the companies as well as broad mutual general releases. We agreed to make payments to NVIDIA totaling $1.5 billion over six years. For further information, see “Note 29: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital economy. We believe that the proliferation of the Internet and cloud computing have driven fundamental changes in the computing industry. We are transforming from a company with a primary focus on the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for PCs and servers to a computing company that delivers complete solutions in the form of hardware and software platforms and supporting services. The number and variety of devices connected to the Internet is growing, and computing is becoming an increasingly personal experience. End users value consistency across devices that connect seamlessly and effortlessly to the Internet and to each other. We will help to enable this experience by innovating around three pillars of computing: energy-efficient performance, connectivity, and security. • Energy-Efficient Performance. We are focusing on improved energy-efficient performance for computing and communications systems and devices. Improved energy-efficient performance involves balancing higher performance with lower power consumption. • Connectivity. We are positioning our business to take advantage of the growth in devices that compute and connect to the Internet. In the first quarter of 2011, we acquired the WLS business of Infineon. This acquisition enables us to offer a portfolio of products that covers a broad range of wireless connectivity options by combining the Intel® WiFi and Intel® WiMAX technologies with WLS’ 2G and 3G technologies, and creates a combined path to accelerate industry adoption of 4G LTE. • Security. Our goal is to enhance security features through a combination of hardware and software solutions. This may include identity protection and fraud deterrence; detection and prevention of malware; securing data and assets; as well as system recovery and enhanced security patching. We expect to complete the acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. We believe that this acquisition will accelerate and enhance our hardware and software security solutions, improving the overall security of our platforms. 25 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) To succeed in the changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives: • Strive to ensure that Intel technology remains the best choice for the PC as well as cloud computing and the data center. • Expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new solutions to the smartphone, the tablet, the TV, the car, and the rest of the embedded world. • Enable devices that connect to the Internet and to each other to create a continuum of personal computing. This continuum would give consumers a set of secure, consistent, and personalized computing experiences. • Positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our energy-efficient technology. We will use our core assets to meet these objectives. Our core assets include our silicon and process technology, our architecture and platforms, our global presence, our strong relationships across the industry, and our brand recognition. We believe that applying these core assets to our key focus areas provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly. Some of our core assets and key focus areas are: • Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. We have long been a leader in silicon process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment and innovation in this critical area. We drive a regular two-year upgrade cycle—introducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our “tick-tock” technology development cadence. As we continue to drive Moore’s Law over the next several years, we believe that the value of this advantage will increase. We aim to have the best process technology, and unlike most semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This allows us to optimize performance, reduce our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly. • Architecture and Platforms. We are now developing a wide range of solutions for devices that span the computing continuum, from PCs and smartphones to smart TVs and in-vehicle infotainment systems and beyond. Users want computing experiences that are consistent and devices that are interoperable. Users and developers value consistency of architecture, which provides a common framework that allows for reduced time to market, with the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. We believe that we can meet the needs of both users and developers by offering Intel® architecture-based computing solutions across the computing continuum. We continue to invest in improving Intel architecture so that we can deliver increased value to our customers in existing market segments and also expand the capabilities of the architecture to meet end-user and customer needs in adjacent market segments. Increasingly, we are delivering our architecture in the form of platforms. Platforms include not only the microprocessor, but other critical hardware and software ingredients that are necessary to create computing solutions. We are expanding our platform capabilities with connectivity solutions, new types of user interfaces, new features and capabilities, and complementary software. • Software. We enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. We seek to expedite growth in various market segments, such as the embedded and handheld market segments, through our software offerings. Additionally, we have collaborated with other companies to develop software platforms optimized for our Intel® Atomtm processors and that support multiple hardware architectures as well as multiple operating systems. • Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized solution compared to components that are used separately. Additionally, we promote industry standards that we believe will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. • Strategic Investments. We make investments in companies around the world that we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business initiatives. Our investments, including those made through our Intel Capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. • Stewardship. We are committed to developing energy-efficient technology solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our environmental impact. We are also committed to helping transform education globally through our technology, program, and policy leadership, as well as funding through the Intel Foundation. In addition, we strive to cultivate a work environment where engaged, energized employees can thrive in their jobs and in their communities. Our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into new market segments. We believe that these new market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers. We also believe that increased Internet traffic and use of cloud computing create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy-efficient performance and virtualization. 26 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Strategy by Major Market Segment The strategy for our PC Client Group operating segment is to offer products that are incorporated into notebook, netbook, tablet, and desktop computers for consumers and businesses. • Our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook PC products designed to improve performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors.

Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: • the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments, net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments; • the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation; • the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; • the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and • the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.6 billion as of December 25, 2010 ($3.4 billion as of December 26, 2009). The majority of this balance as of December 25, 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) of $1.5 billion ($1.6 billion as of December 26, 2009). For additional information, see “Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, other key business factors, and the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of market segment size, market segment share, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by the investee and/or Intel using historical data and available market data. The valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees’ capital structure, and the terms of the investees’ issued interests. For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: • the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; • the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies; • the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; • factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and • the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $125 million in 2010. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2010, impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $11 million to $896 million per quarter. This range included impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC). 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) IMFT/IMFS IMFT and IMFS are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell NAND products to Intel and Micron at manufacturing cost. We determine the fair value of our investment in IMFT/IMFS using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our NAND Solutions Group business, which requires the use of unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. Changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination. We have not had an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in IMFT/IMFS. Long-Lived Assets We assess the impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. Long-lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and property, plant and equipment are considered non-financial assets, and are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments of long-lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2010, impairments and accelerated depreciation of long-lived assets ranged from $10 million to $300 million per quarter. Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 25, 2010, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1.9 billion and total finished goods inventory of $1.4 billion. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. In order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Over the past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments (loss contingencies) that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to customer return rates, costs to repair or replace parts, and where the product is in our customer’s manufacturing process. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see “Note 3: Accounting Changes” and “Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: 2010 2009 2008 % of Net % of Net % of Net (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Net revenue $ 43,623 100.0 % $ 35,127 100.0 % $ 37,586 100.0 % Cost of sales 15,132 34.7 % 15,566 44.3 % 16,742 44.5 % Gross margin 28,491 65.3 % 19,561 55.7 % 20,844 55.5 % Research and development 6,576 15.1 % 5,653 16.1 % 5,722 15.2 % Marketing, general and administrative 6,309 14.5 % 7,931 22.6 % 5,452 14.6 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges — — % 231 0.6 % 710 1.9 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 18 — % 35 0.1 % 6 — % Operating income 15,588 35.7 % 5,711 16.3 % 8,954 23.8 % Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net 117 0.3 % (147 ) (0.4 )% (1,380 ) (3.7 )% Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net 231 0.5 % (23 ) (0.1 )% (376 ) (1.0 )% Interest and other, net 109 0.3 % 163 0.4 % 488 1.3 % Income before taxes 16,045 36.8 % 5,704 16.2 % 7,686 20.4 % Provision for taxes 4,581 10.5 % 1,335 3.8 % 2,394 6.3 % Net income $ 11,464 26.3 % $ 4,369 12.4 % $ 5,292 14.1 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.01 $ 0.77 $ 0.92 Geographic Breakdown of Revenue Our net revenue for 2010 increased $8.5 billion, or 24%, compared to 2009. The increase was due to higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales, as well as higher microprocessor average selling prices. Revenue in the Japan, Asia-Pacific, Americas, and Europe regions increased by 31%, 29%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, compared to 2009. 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our overall gross margin dollars for 2010 increased $8.9 billion, or 46%, compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. To a lesser extent, excess capacity charges recorded in 2009 of $1.1 billion and lower platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit cost contributed to the increase in gross margin dollars for 2010 compared to 2009. These increases were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel® 6 Series Express Chipset family. For further information, see “Note 20: Chipset Design Issue” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 65.3% in 2010 from 55.7% in 2009. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the PC Client Group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, gross margin percentage increases in the Data Center Group and NAND Solutions Group operating segments. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010 and 2009 from the sale of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. See “Business Outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations. Our net revenue for 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008. Average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased and microprocessor and chipset unit sales increased, compared to 2008, primarily due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors and chipsets, which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory products and communications products declined $740 million, primarily as a result of business divestitures. Additionally, an increase in revenue from the sale of NAND flash memory products was mostly offset by a decrease in revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products. Revenue in the Asia-Pacific region increased 2% compared to 2008, while revenue in the Europe, Japan, and Americas regions decreased by 26%, 15%, and 4%, respectively, compared to 2008. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2009 decreased $1.3 billion, or 6%, compared to 2008. The decrease was due to lower revenue, approximately $830 million of higher factory underutilization charges, and approximately $330 million of higher start-up costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower platform unit cost and lower NAND flash memory unit cost. Our overall gross margin percentage increased slightly to 55.7% in 2009 from 55.5% in 2008. The slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increases in the NAND Solutions Group and Data Center Group operating segments, offset by the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group operating segment. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2009, and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008, from the sales of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group (PCCG) for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Microprocessor revenue $ 24,721 $ 19,914 $ 21,516 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 6,877 6,261 6,450 Net revenue $ 31,598 $ 26,175 $ 27,966 Operating income $ 13,304 $ 7,585 $ 9,419 Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $5.4 billion, or 21%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Microprocessors and chipsets within PCCG include those designed for the notebook, netbook, and desktop computing market segments. Significantly higher notebook unit sales were the primary driver for the increase in microprocessor revenue. To a lesser extent, higher notebook average selling prices and higher desktop unit sales also contributed to the increase. The increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales, partially offset by significantly lower revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products. Operating income increased by $5.7 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. During 2009, PCCG recognized approximately $1.0 billion of excess capacity charges, primarily related to microprocessors and chipsets. Additionally, lower platform unit cost in 2010 contributed to the increase in operating income. These impacts were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel® 6 Series Express Chipset family. Additionally, operating expenses in 2010 were higher compared to 2009. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For 2009, net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.8 billion, or 6%, compared to 2008. The decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices, and lower desktop microprocessor unit sales and average selling prices. These decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in netbook microprocessor unit sales due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices and lower unit sales of wireless connectivity products, partially offset by higher chipset unit sales. Operating income decreased by $1.8 billion, or 19%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue and approximately $810 million of higher factory underutilization charges, partially offset by lower platform unit cost. Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group (DCG) for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Microprocessor revenue $ 7,361 $ 5,301 $ 5,126 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 1,332 1,149 1,464 Net revenue $ 8,693 $ 6,450 $ 6,590 Operating income $ 4,395 $ 2,299 $ 2,135 Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $2.2 billion, or 35%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to significantly higher microprocessor unit sales and, to a lesser extent, higher microprocessor average selling prices. The increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales and significantly higher revenue from the sale of wired connectivity products. Operating income increased by $2.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was due to significantly higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower chipset unit cost. For 2009, net revenue for the DCG operating segment decreased slightly by $140 million, or 2%, compared to 2008. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices, partially offset by lower microprocessor unit sales. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices. Operating income increased by $164 million, or 8%, compared to 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by approximately $150 million of higher start-up costs as well as lower chipset revenue. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income for the other Intel architecture (Other IA) operating segments, including the Embedded and Communications Group (ECG), the Digital Home Group, and the Ultra-Mobility Group, for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net revenue $ 1,784 $ 1,402 $ 1,763 Operating income (loss) $ (60 ) $ (179 ) $ (63 ) Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments increased by $382 million, or 27%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue within ECG from significantly higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales. Operating loss decreased by $119 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The operating loss decrease was primarily due to significantly higher ECG revenue and lower ECG unit cost, partially offset by higher operating expenses in ECG and the Ultra-Mobility Group. For 2009, net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $361 million, or 20%, compared to 2008, and operating loss for the Other IA operating segments increased by $116 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The changes were primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within ECG, primarily as a result of business divestitures. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Research and development $ 6,576 $ 5,653 $ 5,722 Marketing, general and administrative $ 6,309 $ 7,931 $ 5,452 Restructuring and asset impairment charges $ — $ 231 $ 710 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles $ 18 $ 35 $ 6 Research and Development. R&D spending increased by $923 million, or 16%, in 2010 compared to 2009, and was flat in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher profit-dependent compensation, an increase in employees, and higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 32nm process technology to R&D of our next-generation 22nm process technology. In 2009 compared to 2008, we had lower process development costs as we transitioned from R&D to manufacturing using our 32nm process technology. This decrease was offset by higher profit-dependent compensation. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.6 billion, or 20%, in 2010 compared to 2009, and increased $2.5 billion, or 45%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in 2010 was due to the 2009 charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) and the $1.25 billion payment to AMD in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement. These decreases were partially offset by higher advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses), higher profit-dependent compensation, and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our Wind River Software Group operating segment and an expense of $100 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010 due to a patent cross-license agreement that we entered into with NVIDIA in January 2011 (see “Note 29: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). The increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the 2009 charge incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the EC and the payment to AMD in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement. To a lesser extent, we had higher profit-dependent compensation expenses that were partially offset by lower advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses). R&D, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in 2010, 39% of net revenue in 2009, and 30% of net revenue in 2008. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 25, 2010: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 2009 restructuring program $ — $ 215 $ — 2008 NAND plan — — 215 2006 efficiency program — 16 495 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ — $ 231 $ 710 2009 Restructuring Program In the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations. These plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. The 2009 restructuring program is complete. The following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring program for the two years ended December 25, 2010: (In Millions) 2010 2009 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ — $ 208 Asset impairments — 7 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ — $ 215 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring program during 2009 and 2010: Employee Severance and Asset (In Millions) Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ — $ — $ — Additional accruals 223 7 230 Adjustments (15 ) — (15 ) Cash payments (182 ) — (182 ) Non-cash settlements — (7 ) (7 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 26 $ — $ 26 Additional accruals — — — Adjustments — — — Cash payments (26 ) — (26 ) Non-cash settlements — — — Accrued restructuring balance as of December 25, 2010 $ — $ — $ — Under the 2009 restructuring program, we incurred $208 million of charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,500 employees. Most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing. We estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges result in gross annual savings of approximately $290 million. We are realizing a substantial majority of these savings within cost of sales. 2008 NAND Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved a plan with Micron to discontinue the supply of NAND flash memory from the 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network. The agreement resulted in a $215 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the IMFT 200mm supply agreement. The restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in IMFT/IMFS of $184 million, a cash payment to Micron of $24 million, and other cash payments of $7 million. The 2008 NAND plan was completed at the end of 2008. 2006 Efficiency Program In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. The following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended December 25, 2010: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ — $ 8 $ 151 Asset impairments — 8 344 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ — $ 16 $ 495 During 2006, as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a result of placing the facility for sale, in 2006 we recorded a $214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment. We incurred $54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008. We sold the Colorado Springs facility in 2009. We incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business in 2007 and an additional $275 million in 2008. We determined the impairment charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007, and determined the impairment charges based on the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs, in 2008. For further information on this divestiture, see “Note 16: Divestitures” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2009: Employee Severance and Asset (In Millions) Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 57 $ — $ 57 Additional accruals 18 8 26 Adjustments (10 ) — (10 ) Cash payments (65 ) — (65 ) Non-cash settlements — (8 ) (8 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ — $ — $ — The 2006 efficiency program is complete. From the third quarter of 2006 through 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. These charges included a total of $686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11,300 employees. A substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. The restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $896 million in asset impairment charges. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $917 million in 2010 ($889 million in 2009 and $851 million in 2008). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 25, 2010, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: Unrecognized Share-Based Weighted Compensation Average (Dollars in Millions) Costs Period Stock options $ 220 1.2 years Restricted stock units $ 1,210 1.3 years Stock purchase plan $ 13 1 month Gains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments, Net Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Equity method losses, net $ (113 ) $ (131 ) $ (316 ) Impairment charges (16 ) (42 ) (1,077 ) Other, net 246 26 13 Total gains (losses) on equity method investments, net $ 117 $ (147 ) $ (1,380 ) We recognized higher gains on sales, lower impairment charges, and lower equity method losses in 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $33 million on the initial public offering of SMART Technologies, Inc., included within “Equity method losses, net,” and a gain of $148 million on the subsequent sale of our shares in the secondary offering, included in “Other, net,” resulting in a total gain of $181 million. We also recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V., included in “Other, net.” Equity method losses, net also includes Clearwire LLC ($116 million loss in 2010 and $27 million loss in 2009), Numonyx ($42 million gain in 2010, $31 million loss in 2009, and $87 million loss in 2008), and Clearwire Corporation ($184 million loss in 2008). For further information, see “Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Impairment charges in 2008 included a $762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire LLC and a $250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Numonyx. We recognized the impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment in the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx was due to a general decline in 2008 in the NOR flash memory market segment. See “Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Gains (Losses) on Other Equity Investments, Net Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Impairment charges $ (109 ) $ (179 ) $ (455 ) Gains on sales, net 185 55 60 Other, net 155 101 19 Total gains (losses) on other equity investments, net $ 231 $ (23 ) $ (376 ) We recognized higher gains on third-party merger transactions, primarily related to our cost method investments; higher gains on sales; and lower impairment charges in 2010 compared to 2009. Gains on other equity investments in 2010 included a gain of $67 million on the sale of shares in Micron, which occurred in the first quarter of 2010. Impairment charges in 2008 included a $176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire Corporation and $97 million of impairment charges on our investment in Micron. The impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charges on our investment in Micron reflected the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in Micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008. In addition, we recognized higher gains on equity derivatives in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and Other, Net The components of interest and other, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ 119 $ 168 $ 592 Interest expense — (1 ) (8 ) Other, net (10 ) (4 ) (96 ) Total interest and other, net $ 109 $ 163 $ 488 Interest income was lower in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. The average interest rate earned during 2010 decreased by approximately 0.5 percentage points compared to 2009. In addition, lower fair value gains on our trading assets (zero in 2010 and $70 million in 2009) were partially offset by lower exchange rate losses (zero in 2010 and $40 million in 2009). Exchange rate losses in 2009 were due to euro exposure related to our euro-denominated liability for the EC fine. We recognized lower interest income in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower interest rates. The average interest rate earned during 2009 decreased by 2.4 percentage points compared to 2008. In addition, lower gains on divestitures (zero in 2009 and $59 million in 2008) were more than offset by $70 million of fair value gains in 2009 on our trading assets, compared to $130 million of fair value losses in 2008. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Income before taxes $ 16,045 $ 5,704 $ 7,686 Provision for taxes $ 4,581 $ 1,335 $ 2,394 Effective tax rate 28.6 % 23.4 % 31.1 % We generated a higher percentage of our profits from higher tax jurisdictions in 2010 compared to 2009, negatively impacting our effective tax rate for 2010. The effective tax rate for 2009 was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine of $1.447 billion in 2009, which was not tax deductible and therefore significantly increased our effective tax rate for 2009. For further information on the EC fine, see “Note 29: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2009 compared to 2008, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2009. In addition, the 2009 tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions compared to a reversal of $103 million for such matters in 2008. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine. In addition, our 2008 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. Business Outlook Our future results of operations and the topics of other forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular: • changes in business and economic conditions; • revenue and pricing; • gross margin and costs; • pending legal proceedings; • our effective tax rate; • marketing, general and administrative expenses; • our goals and strategies; • new product introductions, and product defects and errata; • plans to cultivate new businesses; • R&D expenses; • divestitures, acquisitions, or similar transactions; • net gains (losses) from equity investments; • interest and other, net; • capital spending; • depreciation; and • impairment of investments. Our business outlook incorporates financial projections and assumptions concerning the performance of McAfee, which we expect to acquire in the first quarter of 2011, and the recently acquired WLS business of Infineon (see “Note 15: Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Because we are required to make a number of assumptions about the future performance of these businesses, it may be more difficult to accurately project our financial results. Some of these assumptions include the prospects for the acquired businesses’ products and markets, the ability to retain customer relationships and key employees, successful integration of key technologies or operations, and the potential for unexpected liabilities. In addition, as we integrate these businesses into our operations, our understanding of the financial and operational performance of the acquired businesses may change, which could require an update to our business outlook. Our business outlook contains forward-looking statements and projections based upon estimates of the impact of the chipset design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family (see “Note 20: Chipset Design Issue” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) on our future financial and operating results, including on revenue, gross margin, and inventory valuation, based on our preliminary analysis. Among the factors related to the chipset design issue that could cause actual results to differ are the number of units that may be affected, the impact on systems in the market, the costs that we may incur in repairing or replacing impacted components, the extent to which customers purchase parts from our competitors as a result of our parts shortages or otherwise, the extent of shipments of impacted chipsets for use in PC system configurations that would not be impacted by the design issue, and the extent to which we are able to increase production of substitute or redesigned parts for customers. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our expectations for 2011 are as follows: • Revenue. We expect a 2011 revenue growth percentage in the mid- to high-teens. • Gross Margin Percentage. 63%, plus or minus a few percentage points. The 63% midpoint is lower compared to our 2010 gross margin of 65.3%, primarily due to higher manufacturing period costs, mostly start-up costs, as well as the impacts of the recently completed acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon and the expected acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. We expect these decreases to be partially offset by lower platform unit cost and higher platform revenue. • Total Spending. We expect spending on R&D, plus marketing, general and administrative expenses, in 2011 to be approximately $15.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, compared to $12.9 billion in 2010. • Research and Development Spending. Approximately $8.2 billion compared to $6.6 billion in 2010 as we continue to ramp our new 22nm process technology. • Capital Spending. $9.0 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared to $5.2 billion in 2010. We expect capital spending for 2011 to primarily consist of investments in 22nm process technology. • Depreciation. Approximately $5.0 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.4 billion in 2010. • Tax Rate. Approximately 29%, flat compared to 29% in 2010. The estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect as of December 25, 2010 and expected income. Status of Business Outlook We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in the “Business Outlook” section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. At the same time, we will keep this Form 10-K and our most current business outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com. The public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on our web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. From the close of business on March 4, 2011 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 19, 2011, we will observe a “quiet period.” During the quiet period, the “Business Outlook” section and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 13, 2011, as updated in our Form 8-K filed on January 31, 2011, and as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Dec. 25, Dec. 26, (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments $ 21,497 $ 13,920 Loans receivable and other long-term investments $ 3,876 $ 4,528 Short-term and long-term debt $ 2,115 $ 2,221 Debt as % of stockholders’ equity 4.3 % 5.3 % Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) In summary, our cash flows were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 16,692 $ 11,170 $ 10,926 Net cash used for investing activities (10,539 ) (7,965 ) (5,865 ) Net cash used for financing activities (4,642 ) (2,568 ) (9,018 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,511 $ 637 $ (3,957 ) 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2010 compared to 2009, the $5.5 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to higher net income, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2010 compared to 2009 were $3.7 billion higher, primarily due to higher income before taxes in 2010. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 25, 2010 compared to December 26, 2009 included the following: • Inventories increased due to higher microprocessor inventory, primarily due to ramping new products. • Accounts receivable increased due to a higher proportion of sales at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010. • Accounts payable increased due to timing of payments. For 2010 and 2009, our two largest customers accounted for 38% of our net revenue, with one of these customers accounting for 21% of our net revenue in 2010 and 2009, and another customer accounting for 17% of our net revenue in 2010 and 2009. These two largest customers accounted for 44% of our accounts receivable as of December 25, 2010 (41% as of December 26, 2009). For 2009 compared to 2008, the $244 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower net income. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2009 compared to 2008 were $3.1 billion lower, primarily due to lower income before taxes and timing of payments. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, maturities, disposals, and cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments and, to a lesser extent, higher capital expenditures ($5.2 billion in 2010 and $4.5 billion in 2009). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of trading assets and lower cash paid for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets, and higher cash paid for acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in investments in non-marketable equity investments. Our investments in non-marketable equity investments in 2008 included $1.0 billion for an ownership interest in Clearwire LLC. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2009. During 2010, we repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock compared to $1.8 billion in 2009. As of December 25, 2010, $4.2 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. In January 2011, our Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization limit by $10 billion. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $587 million in 2010 compared to $400 million in 2009. Our total dividend payments were $3.5 billion in 2010 compared to $3.1 billion in 2009 as a result of an increase in quarterly cash dividends per common share. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 73 quarters. In January 2011, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1812 per common share for the first quarter of 2011. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2011. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock and the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans. We used the majority of the proceeds from the 2009 issuance of long-term debt to repurchase common stock. 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. As of December 25, 2010, cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt instruments included in trading assets, and short-term investments totaled $21.5 billion. In addition to the $21.5 billion, we have $3.9 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon. Total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. For further information, see “Note 15: Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2010 were $150 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 25, 2010. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s as of December 25, 2010. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see “Fair Value” in “Note 2: Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis. When fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk and/or Intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 25, 2010, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $24 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $7 billion was classified as Level 1, $16.7 billion as Level 2, and $308 million as Level 3. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. Management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period. Of the $16.7 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 45% of the balance was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 55% due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Equity Securities As of December 25, 2010, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $1.4 billion of marketable equity securities. Of these securities, $1.2 billion was classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period. The remaining marketable equity securities of $223 million were classified as Level 2 because their valuations were either adjusted for security-specific restrictions or based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 25, 2010: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than (In Millions) Total 1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 327 $ 102 $ 142 $ 52 $ 31 Capital purchase obligations1 4,576 4,260 316 — — Other purchase obligations and commitments2 567 393 106 65 3 Long-term debt obligations3 6,969 119 238 238 6,374 Other long-term liabilities4, 5 701 252 184 133 132 Total6 $ 13,140 $ 5,126 $ 986 $ 488 $ 6,540 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2010, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. 2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. 4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $190 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, included on our consolidated balance sheet, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income. 5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $56 million to be made during 2011 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2011 are not practical to estimate. 6 Total generally excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms and/or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table. These obligations include contingent funding/payment obligations and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. Assuming that all future milestones are met, additional required payments related to these obligations were not significant as of December 25, 2010. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. We have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of IMFT in proportion to our investment, which was 49% as of December 25, 2010. We also have several agreements with Micron related to intellectual property rights, and R&D funding related to NAND flash manufacturing. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFT’s inventory was approximately $100 million as of December 25, 2010. See “Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In January 2011, we entered into a patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. We agreed to make payments totaling $1.5 billion to NVIDIA over six years ($300 million in each of January 2011, 2012, and 2013; and $200 million in each of January 2014, 2015, and 2016). For further information, see “Note 29: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding common shares of McAfee for $48.00 per share in cash to be paid to the stockholders of McAfee. As of the date that we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $7.68 billion. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. For further information, see “Note 15: Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the WLS business of Infineon. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition. Total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. For further information, see “Note 15: Acquisitions” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 25, 2010, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market and commodity price risk. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements (see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $35 million as of December 25, 2010 (less than $40 million as of December 26, 2009). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to interest rate loss. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. We refer to our combined investment portfolio, investment hedges, and debt issuances as our net investment position. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. To achieve this objective, the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately $235 million as of December 25, 2010 (an increase of approximately $205 million as of December 26, 2009). A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of up to approximately $15 million as of December 25, 2010 (an increase of approximately $10 million as of December 26, 2009). These hypothetical decreases in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $220 million as of December 25, 2010 (a decrease of $195 million as of December 26, 2009). The fluctuations in fair value of our net investment position reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal, and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. 45 Table of Contents As of December 25, 2010, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $1.5 billion ($805 million as of December 26, 2009). Our marketable equity investments include our investments in Micron, Imagination Technologies Group PLC, VMware, Inc., and Clearwire Corporation, and were carried at a total fair market value of $968 million, or 65% of our marketable equity portfolio, as of December 25, 2010. Our marketable equity method investment in SMART is excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 40% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $365 million, based on the value as of December 25, 2010 (a decrease in value of approximately $405 million, based on the value as of December 26, 2009 using an assumed loss of 50%). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $872 million as of December 25, 2010 ($939 million as of December 26, 2009). As of December 25, 2010, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.8 billion ($2.5 billion as of December 26, 2009). A substantial majority of this balance as of December 25, 2010 was concentrated in our IMFT/IMFS investment of $1.5 billion ($1.6 billion as of December 26, 2009). Our investments as of December 26, 2009 also included an investment of $453 million in Numonyx, which was sold in 2010. For further information, see “Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 46 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:53:09.568008

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. MD&A is organized as follows: • Overview. Discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the company in order to provide context for the remainder of MD&A. • Critical Accounting Estimates. Accounting estimates that we believe are most important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts. • Results of Operations. An analysis of our financial results comparing 2011 to 2010 and comparing 2010 to 2009. In the first quarter of 2011, we formed the Netbook and Tablet Group (NTG), which includes microprocessors and related chipsets designed for the netbook and tablet market segments. NTG results were previously included in the results of the PC Client Group and are now included in the other Intel architecture operating segments category. The analysis of our operating segment results of operations reflects this reorganization, and prior-period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively. • Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity. • Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Discussion of the methodologies used in the valuation of our financial instruments. • Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. Overview of contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off-balance-sheet arrangements outstanding as of December 31, 2011, including expected payment schedule. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements. Words such as “expects,” “goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 23, 2012. Overview Our results of operations were as follows: 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (Dollars in Millions) Dec. 31,2011 Oct. 1,2011 Dec. 31,2011 Dec. 25,2010 Net revenue $ 13,887 $ 14,233 $ 53,999 $ 43,623 Gross margin $ 8,952 $ 9,018 $ 33,757 $ 28,491 Gross margin percentage 64.5 % 63.4 % 62.5 % 65.3 % Operating income $ 4,599 $ 4,785 $ 17,477 $ 15,588 Net income $ 3,360 $ 3,468 $ 12,942 $ 11,464 Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.64 $ 0.65 $ 2.39 $ 2.01 2011 was our most profitable year, with record revenue, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Revenue of $54.0 billion was up $10.4 billion, or 24% from a year ago, and was our second year in a row with revenue growing over 20%. We saw growth in 2011 in both our client business and our data center business. Our client business is benefiting as rising incomes increase the affordability of PCs in emerging markets. Our data center business is benefiting as the increasing number of devices that compute and connect to the Internet drives the build-out of the cloud infrastructure. Additionally, we completed the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon in 2011, which combined contributed approximately $3.6 billion to our revenue growth. Our 2011 gross margin percentage was down 2.8 percentage points compared to 2010. The decline was primarily driven by the increase in start-up costs associated with 22nm factories as well as the impact of acquisitions. These declines were partially offset by growth in our platform business. Our fourth quarter revenue of $13.9 billion was down $346 million from the third quarter of 2011. The floods in Thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply shortage negatively impacted our fourth quarter revenue as our customers reduced inventories across the supply chain. We expect the shortage of hard disk drives to continue to impact our business in the first quarter of 2012. Compared to the third quarter of 2011, our fourth quarter gross margin was up 1.1 percentage points as a result of lower manufacturing costs (platform unit costs and other cost of sales), partially offset by higher platform write-offs. 23 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our strong financial performance during 2011 has allowed us to make significant investments in our business as well as increase the return of cash to our stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. For 2011, we generated a record $21.0 billion of cash from operations and ended the quarter with an investment portfolio of $14.8 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets. During 2011, we issued $5.0 billion of senior unsecured notes, primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock; repurchased $14.1 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program; purchased $10.8 billion in capital assets; spent $8.7 billion on acquisitions; and returned $4.1 billion to stockholders through dividends. In January 2012, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per common share for the first quarter of 2012. Looking ahead to 2012, we believe that the emerging market, the data center, and enterprise trends that drove our revenue in 2011 will continue to drive our business in 2012. In addition, we have a strong product and technology pipeline coming to market with the ramp of Ultrabook systems with the launch of our 22nm process technology microprocessors (code named “Ivy Bridge”), the launch of our new server platform (code named “Romley”), security, and Intel processor-powered smartphones and tablets. For 2012, we are also forecasting a gross margin increase of 1.5 percentage points, to 64%. We expect lower start-up costs, no impact from the Intel® 6 Series Express Chipset design issue, and higher platform revenue. These increases to gross margin are expected to be partially offset by higher platform unit costs as we ramp Ivy Bridge. We are forecasting an increase in our investment in R&D of approximately $1.8 billion as we make incremental investment in technologies for Ultrabook systems, data centers, smartphones, and tablets. Additionally, we are making investments in core capabilities such as security, SoCs, and extending our process technology leadership. We are forecasting an increase in capital spending to $12.5 billion, which is $1.7 billion higher than in 2011, as we build the world’s first high-volume manufacturing factories for 14nm process technology. We believe that this continued investment will allow our process technology and manufacturing advantage to continue to extend in 2012, enabling a leadership product portfolio. Our Business Outlook for 2012 includes our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending, and capital expenditures. We will keep our most current Business Outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com. This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K. The public can continue to rely on the Business Outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in Business Outlook and forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. The forward-looking statements in Business Outlook will be effective through the close of business on March 16, 2012 unless updated earlier. From the close of business on March 16, 2012 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 17, 2012, we will observe a “quiet period.” During the quiet period, Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 19, 2012, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company’s news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our Business Outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: • the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments; • the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization; • the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; • the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and • the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. 24 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2011 ($2.6 billion as of December 25, 2010). Approximately half of this balance as of December 31, 2011 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in IMFT and IMFS of $1.3 billion ($1.5 billion as of December 25, 2010). For additional information, see “Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenue, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees’ capital structures, the terms of the investees’ issued interests, and the lack of marketability of the investments. For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: • the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; • the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies; • the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; • factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and • the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $63 million in 2011. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2011, impairments of non-marketable equity investments ranged from $8 million to $79 million per quarter. 25 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Long-Lived Assets Property, Plant and Equipment We assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2011, impairments and accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment ranged from $10 million to $75 million per quarter. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in “Note 30: Operating Segment and Geographic Information” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If, during this second step, we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of both the income and market methods to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and Intel’s assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for both long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. The reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. 26 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we completed our annual impairment assessments, and impairment tests when necessary, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. Identified Intangibles We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If it is determined that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment reviews of our intangible assets, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $10 million in 2011 and no impairment charges in the prior two fiscal years. Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 31, 2011, we had total work-in-process inventory of $1.7 billion and total finished goods inventory of $1.8 billion. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Over the past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments (loss contingencies) that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to customer return rates, costs to repair or replace parts, and where the product is in our customer’s manufacturing process. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see “Note 3: Accounting Changes” and “Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenue Net revenue $ 53,999 100.0 % $ 43,623 100.0 % $ 35,127 100.0 % Cost of sales 20,242 37.5 % 15,132 34.7 % 15,566 44.3 % Gross margin 33,757 62.5 % 28,491 65.3 % 19,561 55.7 % Research and development 8,350 15.4 % 6,576 15.1 % 5,653 16.1 % Marketing, general and administrative 7,670 14.2 % 6,309 14.5 % 7,931 22.6 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges — — % — — % 231 0.6 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 260 0.5 % 18 — % 35 0.1 % Operating income 17,477 32.4 % 15,588 35.7 % 5,711 16.3 % Gains (losses) on equity investments, net 112 0.2 % 348 0.8 % (170 ) (0.5 )% Interest and other, net 192 0.3 % 109 0.3 % 163 0.4 % Income before taxes 17,781 32.9 % 16,045 36.8 % 5,704 16.2 % Provision for taxes 4,839 8.9 % 4,581 10.5 % 1,335 3.8 % Net income $ 12,942 24.0 % $ 11,464 26.3 % $ 4,369 12.4 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.39 $ 2.01 $ 0.77 Geographic Breakdown of Revenue Our net revenue for 2011, which included 53 weeks, increased $10.4 billion, or 24%, compared to 2010, which included 52 weeks. The increase was due to significantly higher platform (microprocessor and chipset) average selling prices and, to a lesser extent, slightly higher platform unit sales. Revenue from Intel Mobile Communications (formerly the WLS business of Infineon) and McAfee contributed $3.6 billion to 2011 revenue. Revenue in the Americas, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Japan regions increased by 31%, 24%, 23%, and 13%, respectively, compared to 2010. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2011 increased $5.3 billion, or 18%, compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue from our existing business as well as our acquired business. The increase was partially offset by approximately $1.0 billion of higher start-up costs compared to 2010. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a $482 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2011, compared to $65 million in 2010, primarily due to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon. 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 62.5% in 2011 from 65.3% in 2010. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group and, to a lesser extent, the gross margin percentage decrease in the other Intel architecture operating segments. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2011, and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010, from the sale of platforms in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. Our net revenue for 2010 increased $8.5 billion, or 24%, compared to 2009. The increase was due to significantly higher platform unit sales and, to a lesser extent, higher platform average selling prices. Revenue in the Japan, Asia-Pacific, Americas, and Europe regions increased by 31%, 29%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, compared to 2009. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2010 increased $8.9 billion, or 46%, compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. To a lesser extent, excess capacity charges recorded in 2009 of $1.1 billion and lower platform unit costs contributed to the increase in gross margin dollars for 2010 compared to 2009. These increases were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel® 6 Series Express Chipset family. For further information, see “Note 20: Chipset Design Issue” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 65.3% in 2010 from 55.7% in 2009. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the PC Client Group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, gross margin percentage increases in the Data Center Group, the other Intel architecture operating segments, and the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010 and 2009 from the sale of platforms in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group (PCCG) for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net revenue $ 35,406 $ 30,327 $ 24,894 Operating income $ 14,793 $ 12,971 $ 7,441 Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $5.1 billion, or 17%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Platforms within PCCG include those designed for the notebook and desktop computing market segments. The increase in revenue was due to higher notebook platform unit sales and higher notebook platform average selling prices. To a lesser extent, higher desktop platform average selling prices and slightly higher desktop platform unit sales also contributed to the increase. Operating income increased by $1.8 billion in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. The increase was partially offset by approximately $960 million of higher start-up costs. Higher operating expenses, platform unit costs, and inventory write-offs compared to 2010 also contributed to the offset. For 2010, net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $5.4 billion, or 22%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Significantly higher notebook platform unit sales were the primary driver for the increase in revenue. To a lesser extent, higher desktop platform unit sales and slightly higher notebook platform average selling prices also contributed to the increase. Operating income increased by $5.5 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. During 2009, PCCG recognized approximately $1.0 billion of excess capacity charges. Additionally, lower platform unit costs in 2010 contributed to the increase in operating income. These impacts were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel® 6 Series Express Chipset family. Additionally, operating expenses in 2010 were higher compared to 2009. 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group (DCG) for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net revenue $ 10,129 $ 8,693 $ 6,450 Operating income $ 5,100 $ 4,388 $ 2,289 Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in revenue was due to significantly higher server platform unit sales. To a lesser extent, slightly higher server platform average selling prices also contributed to the increase. Operating income increased by $712 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses compared to 2010. For 2010, net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $2.2 billion, or 35%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily due to significantly higher server platform unit sales. To a lesser extent, higher server platform average selling prices also contributed to the increase. Operating income increased by $2.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was due to significantly higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower platform unit costs. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the other Intel architecture (Other IA) operating segments, including Intel Mobile Communications (IMC), the Intelligent Systems Group (ISG), the Netbook and Tablet Group (NTG), and the Ultra-Mobility Group (UMG), for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net revenue $ 5,005 $ 3,055 $ 2,683 Operating income (loss) $ (577 ) $ 270 $ (45 ) Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments increased by $2.0 billion, or 64%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to IMC revenue, an operating segment formed from the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon in the first quarter of 2011. To a lesser extent, significantly higher embedded platform unit sales within ISG also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower netbook platform unit sales within NTG. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $847 million from an operating income of $270 million in 2010 to an operating loss of $577 million in 2011. The decline in operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses within each of the Other IA operating segments, partially offset by higher revenue. For 2010, net revenue for the Other IA operating segments increased by $372 million, or 14%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was due to significantly higher embedded platform unit sales within ISG. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments increased by $315 million, from an operating loss of $45 million in 2009 to an operating income of $270 million in 2010. The increase in operating results was due to higher revenue and lower netbook platform unit costs within NTG. To a lesser extent, lower embedded platform unit costs within ISG also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses in NTG and ISG. 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Software and Services Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the software and services operating segments, including McAfee, the Wind River Software Group, and the Software and Services Group, for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net revenue $ 1,870 $ 264 $ 115 Operating income (loss) $ (32 ) $ (175 ) $ (100 ) Net revenue for the software and services operating segments increased by $1.6 billion in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due to revenue from McAfee, which was acquired during the first quarter of 2011. Due to the revaluation of McAfee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value, we excluded $204 million of revenue that would have been reported in 2011 if McAfee’s deferred revenue had not been written down due to the acquisition. The operating loss for the software and services operating segments decreased by $143 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expense across each of the software and services operating segments. Due to the revaluation of McAfee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value at the time of acquisition, we excluded revenue and associated costs that would have increased operating results by $190 million in 2011. For 2010, net revenue for the software and services operating segments increased by $149 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue from the Wind River Software Group. We acquired Wind River Systems, Inc. during the third quarter of 2009. The operating loss for the software and services operating segments increased by $75 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating losses was due to higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenue within the Wind River Software Group. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Research and development $ 8,350 $ 6,576 $ 5,653 Marketing, general and administrative $ 7,670 $ 6,309 $ 7,931 Restructuring and asset impairment charges $ — $ — $ 231 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles $ 260 $ 18 $ 35 Research and Development. R&D spending increased by $1.8 billion, or 27%, in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased by $923 million, or 16%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of McAfee and IMC, and higher compensation expenses based on an increase in employees. In addition, lower overall process development costs due to the transition to manufacturing start-up costs related to our 22nm process technology were mostly offset by higher process development costs due to R&D of our next-generation 14nm process technology. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher profit-dependent compensation, an increase in employees, and higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 32nm process technology to R&D of our 22nm process technology. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $1.4 billion, or 22%, in 2011 compared to 2010, and decreased $1.6 billion, or 20%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of McAfee and IMC, higher compensation expenses based on an increase in employees, and higher advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses). The decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the 2009 charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) and the $1.25 billion payment to AMD in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement. These decreases were partially offset by higher advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses), higher profit-dependent compensation, and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our Wind River Software Group operating segment and an expense of $100 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010 due to a patent cross-license agreement that we entered into with NVIDIA in January 2011 (see “Note 17: Identified Intangible Assets” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). R&D, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in 2011 and 2010, and 39% of net revenue in 2009. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 31, 2011: 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions) 2011 2010 2009 2009 restructuring program $ — $ — $ 215 2006 efficiency program — — 16 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ — $ — $ 231 The 2009 restructuring included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. The 2006 efficiency program was designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. Both programs are complete. Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles. The increase of $242 million was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon, both completed in the first quarter of 2011. For further information, see “Note 14: Acquisitions” and “Note 17: Identified Intangible Assets” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion in 2011 ($917 million in 2010 and $889 million in 2009). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 31, 2011, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: 000,000 000,000 (Dollars in Millions) UnrecognizedShare-BasedCompensationCosts WeightedAveragePeriod Stock options $ 161 1.0 years Restricted stock units $ 1,275 1.2 years As of December 31, 2011, there was $13 million in unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan, and we expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months. Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other Gains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other, net for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Gains (losses) on equity investments, net $ 112 $ 348 $ (170 ) Interest and other, net $ 192 $ 109 $ 163 Net gains on equity investments were lower in 2011 compared to 2010. We recognized lower gains on sales, higher equity method losses, and lower gains on third-party merger transactions in 2011 compared to 2010. We recognized a net gain on equity investments in 2010 compared to a net loss in 2009. In 2010, we recognized higher gains on sales, higher gains on third-party merger transactions, lower impairment charges, and lower equity method losses compared to 2009. Net gains on equity investments for 2011 included a gain of $150 million on the sale of shares in VMware, Inc. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $181 million on the initial public offering of SMART Technologies, Inc. and subsequent partial sale of our shares in the secondary offering. We also recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V., and a gain of $67 million on the sale of shares in Micron in 2010. Net gains (losses) on equity investments also included our proportionate share of the income or loss from Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) ($145 million loss in 2011, $116 million loss in 2010, and $27 million loss in 2009) and Numonyx ($42 million gain in 2010 and $31 million loss in 2009). The equity method losses recognized in 2011 reduced our carrying value in Clearwire LLC to zero. We do not expect to recognize additional equity method losses for Clearwire LLC in the future. For further information, see “Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Interest and other, net increased in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to a $164 million gain recognized upon formation of the Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC joint venture during 2011. For further information, see “Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments,” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The gain was partially offset by the recognition of $41 million of interest expense in 2011 compared to zero in 2010 and lower interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of lower average investment balances. We recognized interest expense in 2011 due to the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2011. Interest and other, net was lower in 2010 compared to 2009 on lower interest income. Interest income was lower as a result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. The average interest rate earned during 2010 decreased by approximately 0.5 percentage points compared to 2009. In addition, lower fair value gains on our trading assets (zero in 2010 and $70 million in 2009) were partially offset by lower exchange rate losses (zero in 2010 and $40 million in 2009). Exchange rate losses in 2009 were due to euro exposure related to our euro-denominated liability for the EC fine of $1.447 billion in 2009. For further information on the EC fine, see “Note 29: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: 000,000 000,000 000,000 (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Income before taxes $ 17,781 $ 16,045 $ 5,704 Provision for taxes $ 4,839 $ 4,581 $ 1,335 Effective tax rate 27.2 % 28.6 % 23.4 % We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2011 compared to 2010, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2011. We generated a higher percentage of our profits from higher tax jurisdictions in 2010 compared to 2009, negatively impacting our effective tax rate for 2010. The effective tax rate for 2009 was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine of $1.447 billion in 2009, which was not tax deductible and therefore significantly increased our effective tax rate for 2009. For further information on the EC fine, see “Note 29: Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources 000,000 000,000 (Dollars in Millions) Dec. 31,2011 Dec. 25,2010 Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets $ 14,837 $ 21,497 Loans receivable and other long-term investments $ 1,769 $ 3,876 Short-term and long-term debt $ 7,331 $ 2,115 Debt as % of stockholders’ equity 16.0 % 4.3 % Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) In summary, our cash flows were as follows: 000,000 000,000 000,000 (In Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 20,963 $ 16,692 $ 11,170 Net cash used for investing activities (10,301 ) (10,539 ) (7,965 ) Net cash used for financing activities (11,100 ) (4,642 ) (2,568 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents 5 — — Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (433 ) $ 1,511 $ 637 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2011 compared to 2010, the $4.3 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for non-cash items and higher net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher for 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization of intangibles, as well as increases in non-acquisition-related deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2011 compared to 2010 were $1.3 billion lower, largely due to the tax benefit of depreciating 100% of assets placed in service in the United States in 2011. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010 included the following: • Income taxes payable increased and income taxes receivable decreased due to timing of payments. • Accounts payable increased due to business growth as well as an increase in capital spending. • Accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. For 2011, our two largest customers accounted for 34% of our net revenue (38% in 2010 and 2009), with one of these customers accounting for 19% of our net revenue (21% in 2010 and 2009), and another customer accounting for 15% of our net revenue (17% in 2010 and 2009). These two largest customers accounted for 32% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2011 (44% as of December 25, 2010). For 2010 compared to 2009, the $5.5 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to higher net income, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2010 compared to 2009 were $3.7 billion higher, primarily due to higher income before taxes in 2010. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals, as well as cash used for acquisitions. Cash used for investing activities decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010. A decrease due to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments in 2011, as compared to net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2010, was offset by higher cash paid for acquisitions, of which the substantial majority was for our acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011, and an increase in capital expenditures as we build and equip our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity. Our capital expenditures were $10.8 billion in 2011 ($5.2 billion in 2010 and $4.5 billion in 2009) due to expanding our network of fabrication facilities to include an additional large-scale fabrication facility as well as bringing our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity online in 2011. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available-for-sale investments and, to a lesser extent, higher capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of trading assets and lower cash paid for acquisitions. 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in 2011 and higher proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. We have an ongoing authorization, since October 2005, as amended, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $45 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. This amount includes $20 billion of increases in the authorization limit approved by our Board of Directors in 2011. During 2011, we repurchased $14.1 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to $1.5 billion in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, $10.1 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $2.0 billion in 2011 compared to $587 million in 2010. Our total dividend payments were $4.1 billion in 2011 compared to $3.5 billion in 2010 as a result of increases in quarterly cash dividends per common share. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 77 quarters. In January 2012, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per common share for the first quarter of 2012. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2012 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2012. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the issuance of long-term debt in 2009. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse portfolio that we continuously analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $14.8 billion ($21.5 billion as of December 25, 2010). In addition to the $14.8 billion, we have $1.8 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a majority of the issuers are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. As certain countries in Europe are experiencing economic uncertainty, we continue to monitor the credit quality of our European sovereign and non-sovereign debt investments. The credit quality of our investment portfolio within the European region remains high, with substantially all of our sovereign debt investments with AA-/Aa3 or better rated issuers, and most of the non-sovereign debt issuers rated A/A2 or better. As of December 31, 2011, our total investments located in Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal were approximately $50 million, all of which matures in 2012. We have $1 million in unrealized losses related to these investments. These countries have experienced significant economic uncertainty and credit downgrades, so we will only make investments in these countries in the future if their risk profile meets our investment objectives. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2011 were $1.4 billion, and $200 million of commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s as of December 31, 2011. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. In the third quarter of 2011, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $5.0 billion aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes. These notes were issued primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and for general corporate purposes. For further information on the terms of the notes, see “Note 21: Borrowings” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see “Fair Value” in “Note 2: Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value. When fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuer’s credit risk or Intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 31, 2011, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $15.1 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $6.1 billion was classified as Level 1, $8.7 billion as Level 2, and $218 million as Level 3. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. Management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period. Of the $8.7 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 60% of the balance was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 40% due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate our fair value measurements using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes from a second source. Loans Receivable As of December 31, 2011, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $748 million of loans receivable. All of these securities were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Marketable Equity Securities As of December 31, 2011, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $562 million of marketable equity securities. Most of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period. 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 000,000 Payments Due by Period (In Millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years More Than5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 707 $ 183 $ 254 $ 134 $ 136 Capital purchase obligations1 4,652 4,605 47 — — Other purchase obligations and commitments2 1,001 633 309 55 4 Long-term debt obligations3 14,822 292 572 2,072 11,886 Other long-term liabilities4, 5 1,954 609 702 534 109 Total6 $ 23,136 $ 6,322 $ 1,884 $ 2,795 $ 12,135 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. 2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. 4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $165 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes. 5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $65 million to be made during 2012 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2012 are not practical to estimate. 6 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding/payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. Contractual obligations with regard to our investment in IMFT/IMFS are not included in the preceding table. We are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFT’s and 22% of IMFS’s production output and production-related services. We also have several agreements with Micron related to IP, and R&D funding related to non-volatile memory manufacturing. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFT/IMFS’s inventory was approximately $125 million as of December 31, 2011. For further information, see “Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market risk. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, the Israeli shekel, and the Chinese yuan. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. For further information, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $40 million as of December 31, 2011 (less than $35 million as of December 25, 2010). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to interest rate loss. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness. Our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. For further information, see “Note 17: Identified Intangible Assets” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2011 (an increase of approximately $250 million as of December 25, 2010). The significant increase from December 25, 2010 is primarily driven by the inclusion of the $5.0 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the third quarter of 2011. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $20 million as of December 31, 2011 (an increase of approximately $15 million as of December 25, 2010). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see “Note 5: Fair Value” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. 41 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $585 million ($1.5 billion as of December 25, 2010). Our marketable equity investment in Imagination Technologies Group PLC was carried at a total fair market value of $327 million, or 56% of our marketable equity portfolio, as of December 31, 2011. Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 45% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $265 million, based on the value as of December 31, 2011 (a decrease in value of approximately $365 million, based on the value as of December 25, 2010 using an assumed loss of 40%). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 ($872 million as of December 25, 2010). As of December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.6 billion ($1.8 billion as of December 25, 2010). Approximately half of the total non-marketable equity investments balance as of December 31, 2011 was concentrated in our IMFT/IMFS investment of $1.3 billion ($1.5 billion as of December 25, 2010). 42 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:52:57.717037

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. MD&A is organized as follows: • Overview. Discussion of our business and overall analysis of financial and other highlights affecting the company in order to provide context for the remainder of MD&A. • Critical Accounting Estimates. Accounting estimates that we believe are most important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts. • Results of Operations. An analysis of our financial results comparing 2012 to 2011 and comparing 2011 to 2010. • Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows, and discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity. • Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Discussion of the methodologies used in the valuation of our financial instruments. • Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements. Overview of contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off-balance-sheet arrangements outstanding as of December 29, 2012, including expected payment schedule. The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “goals,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, uncertain events or assumptions, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 19, 2013. 24 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Overview Our results of operations were as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (Dollars in Millions) Dec. 29,2012 Sept. 29,2012 Change Dec. 29,2012 Dec. 31,2011 Change Net revenue $ 13,477 $ 13,457 $ 20 $ 53,341 $ 53,999 $ (658 ) Gross margin $ 7,817 $ 8,515 $ (698 ) $ 33,151 $ 33,757 $ (606 ) Gross margin percentage 58.0 % 63.3 % (5.3 )% 62.1 % 62.5 % (0.4 )% Operating income $ 3,155 $ 3,841 $ (686 ) $ 14,638 $ 17,477 $ (2,839 ) Net income $ 2,468 $ 2,972 $ (504 ) $ 11,005 $ 12,942 $ (1,937 ) Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.48 $ 0.58 $ (0.10 ) $ 2.13 $ 2.39 $ (0.26 ) Our revenue for 2012 was down 1% from 2011 and lower than we expected at the start of the year. Worldwide gross domestic product growth was less than expected as we entered 2012, and PC Client Group revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with PCs for consumer sales. Data Center Group revenue grew 6% in 2012 as a richer mix of products and significant growth in the Internet cloud segment was partially offset by weakness in the enterprise market segment. Our gross margin percentage for 2012 was flat compared to 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher platform unit costs were offset by lower start-up costs and no impact in 2012 for the Intel® 6 Series Express Chipset design issue. Our fourth quarter revenue of $13.5 billion was flat from the third quarter of 2012. Historically, our revenue generally has increased in the fourth quarter. However, softness in PC demand and continued decline of inventory in the PC supply chain as OEMs reduce inventory on older-generation products negatively impacted our results for the fourth quarter. The decline in our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter was driven by excess capacity charges as we responded to lower demand by bringing down inventory levels and redirecting capital resources to our 14nm process technology. Our gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory reserves on production of our next-generation microarchitecture products, code-named Haswell, which we expect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013. During 2012 we made significant product introductions across all our businesses, including PC client, servers, smartphones and tablets, and extended our manufacturing and process technology leadership. We launched our next-generation server-based products, the Intel Xeon processor E5 family, which provides higher performance and better energy-efficiency than prior-generation products. In 2012 we continued to extend our process technology leadership with the introduction of our 22nm process technology products that utilize three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistor technology. These products also improve performance and energy efficiency compared to prior generation products and helped us accelerate our Ultrabook strategy. In 2012 we entered the smartphone market segment with six mobile phone providers launching the first Intel architecture-based smartphones. We are also expanding in the tablet market segment with designs based on Android* and Windows* operating systems currently shipping. In a challenging environment our business continues to produce significant cash from operations, generating $18.9 billion in 2012. We returned $4.4 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased $4.8 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. In addition, we purchased $11.0 billion in capital assets as we continue to make significant investments to extend our manufacturing leadership. During the third quarter of 2012, we also entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of 450-millimeter (mm) wafer technology and extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography. The agreements included Intel’s purchase of ASML equity securities totaling $3.2 billion. We also took advantage of the low interest rate environment in 2012 and issued $6.2 billion of senior notes. From a financial condition perspective, we ended the year with an investment portfolio of $18.2 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and trading assets. In January 2013, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share for the first quarter of 2013. As we look into 2013, we expect revenue to grow in the low single digits with particular strength in our server market segment. We believe the renewed innovation in the PC industry that we fostered with Ultrabook systems and expanded to other thin and light form factors, will blur the lines between tablets and notebooks and provide growth opportunities in 2013. We also expect to launch new SoCs for smartphones and tablets, based on our 22nm process technology. In 2013, we expect an increase in capital expenditures primarily driven by beginning construction of a 450mm development facility as we progress toward manufacturing with 450mm wafer technology later in the decade. 25 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our Business Outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2013 includes, where applicable, our current expectations for revenue, gross margin percentage, spending (R&D plus MG&A), and capital expenditures. We will keep our most current Business Outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site www.intc.com. This Business Outlook is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet publicly or privately with investors and others, and may reiterate the forward-looking statements contained in Business Outlook or in this Form 10-K. The public can continue to rely on the Business Outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in Business Outlook and forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. The forward-looking statements in Business Outlook will be effective through the close of business on March 15, 2013 unless updated earlier. From the close of business on March 15, 2013 until our quarterly earnings release is published, currently scheduled for April 16, 2013, we will observe a “quiet period.” During the quiet period, Business Outlook and other forward-looking statements first published in our Form 8-K filed on January 17, 2013, and other forward-looking statements disclosed in the company’s news releases and filings with the SEC, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10-K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our Business Outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: • the valuation of non-marketable equity investments and the determination of other-than-temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity investments, net when we record impairments; • the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment; goodwill; and identified intangibles), which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization; • the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; • the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and • the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. In the following section, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. Non-Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non-marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.2 billion as of December 29, 2012 ($2.8 billion as of December 31, 2011). Our non-marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non-marketable equity investments are classified within other long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success depends on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile, and other key business factors. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 26 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of relevant factors, including comparable companies’ sizes, growth rates, industries, and development stages. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed using available market, historical, and forecast data. The valuation of our non-marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees’ capital structures, the terms of the investees’ issued interests, and the lack of marketability of the investments. For non-marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: • the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre-defined milestones and overall business prospects; • the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies; • the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory and economic changes; • factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business, such as the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and • the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non-marketable equity investments were $104 million in 2012. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2012, impairments of non- marketable equity investments ranged from $8 million to $59 million per quarter. Long-Lived Assets Property, Plant and Equipment We assess property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. We measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value. Property, plant and equipment is considered a non-financial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2012, impairments and accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment ranged from zero to $36 million per quarter. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit. Reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in “Note 28: Operating Segment and Geographic Information” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value. For reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. For reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If we determine during this second step that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value. The income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies. Our estimates of market segment growth, our market segment share, and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources. These estimates are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. The same estimates are also used in planning for our long-term manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process, and for long-term and short-term business planning and forecasting. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data. The market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. The reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. For the annual impairment assessment in 2012, we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill, it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. As a result, we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units. During the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years, we completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years. Identified Intangibles We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. We perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite-lived intangible assets, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If we determine that an individual asset is impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Based on our impairment reviews of our intangible assets, we recognized impairment charges of $21 million in 2012, $10 million in 2011, and no impairment charges in 2010. Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work-in-process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 29, 2012, we had total work-in-process inventory of $2.2 billion and total finished goods inventory of $2.0 billion. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product-specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. To determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; therefore, it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. In the fourth quarter of 2012, excess capacity charges were $480 million. In the previous 11 quarters, excess capacity charges were less than $50 million in each quarter. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims as well as accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, and product warranties and potential asset impairments (loss contingencies) that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to customer return rates, costs to repair or replace parts, and where the product is in our customer’s manufacturing process. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Accounting Changes For a description of accounting changes, see “Note 3: Accounting Changes.” 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: 2012 2011 2010 (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenue Dollars % of NetRevenue Net revenue $ 53,341 100.0 % $ 53,999 100.0 % $ 43,623 100.0 % Cost of sales 20,190 37.9 % 20,242 37.5 % 15,132 34.7 % Gross margin 33,151 62.1 % 33,757 62.5 % 28,491 65.3 % Research and development 10,148 19.0 % 8,350 15.4 % 6,576 15.1 % Marketing, general and administrative 8,057 15.1 % 7,670 14.2 % 6,309 14.5 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 308 0.6 % 260 0.5 % 18 — % Operating income 14,638 27.4 % 17,477 32.4 % 15,588 35.7 % Gains (losses) on equity investments, net 141 0.3 % 112 0.2 % 348 0.8 % Interest and other, net 94 0.2 % 192 0.3 % 109 0.3 % Income before taxes 14,873 27.9 % 17,781 32.9 % 16,045 36.8 % Provision for taxes 3,868 7.3 % 4,839 8.9 % 4,581 10.5 % Net income $ 11,005 20.6 % $ 12,942 24.0 % $ 11,464 26.3 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.13 $ 2.39 $ 2.01 Our net revenue for 2012, which included 52 weeks, decreased by $658 million, or 1%, compared to 2011, which included 53 weeks. PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform volume decreased 1% while average selling prices were unchanged. Additionally, lower IMC average selling prices and lower netbook platform volume contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by our McAfee operating segment, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2011. McAfee contributed $469 million of additional revenue in 2012 compared to 2011. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2012 decreased by $606 million, or 2%, compared to 2011. The decrease was due in large part to approximately $490 million of excess capacity charges, as well as lower PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform revenue. To a lesser extent, higher PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform unit costs as well as lower netbook and IMC revenue contributed to the decrease. The decrease was partially offset by approximately $645 million of lower start-up costs as we transition from our 22nm process technology to R&D of our next-generation 14nm process technology, as well as $422 million of charges recorded in 2011 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family. The decrease was also partially offset by the two additional months of results from our acquisition of McAfee, which occurred on February 28, 2011, contributing approximately $334 million of additional gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 2011. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a $557 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2012, compared to $482 million in 2011, primarily due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011. Our overall gross margin percentage in 2012 was flat from 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform unit costs in 2012 were offset by lower start-up costs and no impact in 2012 for the Intel 6 Series Express Chipset design issue. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 and 2011 from the sale of platforms in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. Our net revenue for 2011, which included 53 weeks, increased $10.4 billion, or 24%, compared to 2010, which included 52 weeks. PC Client Group and Data Center Group platform revenue increased $6.3 billion on 8% higher average selling prices and 7% higher unit sales. Additionally, $3.6 billion of the increase in revenue was due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011 (primarily IMC and McAfee). Our overall gross margin dollars for 2011 increased $5.3 billion, or 18%, compared to 2010, primarily reflecting higher revenue from our existing business and our acquisitions as discussed previously. The increase was partially offset by approximately $1.0 billion of higher start-up costs compared to 2010. The amortization of acquisition-related intangibles resulted in a $482 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2011, compared to $65 million in 2010, primarily due to the acquisitions in the first quarter of 2011. 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 62.5% in 2011 from 65.3% in 2010. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group and, to a lesser extent, the gross margin percentage decrease in the other Intel architecture operating segments. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2011 and most of our gross margin dollars in 2010 from the sale of platforms in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: (In Millions) 2012 2011 2010 Net revenue $ 34,274 $ 35,406 $ 30,327 Operating income $ 13,053 $ 14,793 $ 12,971 Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.1 billion, or 3%, in 2012 compared to 2011. PCCG revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with PCs for consumer sales. Platform average selling prices and unit sales decreased 2% and 1%, respectively. The decrease was driven by 6% lower notebook platform average selling prices and 5% lower desktop platform volume. These decreases were partially offset by a 4% increase in desktop platform average selling prices and a 2% increase in notebook platform volume. Operating income decreased by $1.7 billion, or 12%, in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by $649 million of lower gross margin and $1.1 billion of higher operating expenses. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower platform revenue. Additionally, approximately $455 million of higher excess capacity charges and higher platform unit costs contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $785 million of lower start-up costs as we transition from manufacturing start-up costs related to our 22nm process technology to R&D of our next-generation 14nm process technology. Additionally, the first half of 2011 included $422 million of charges recorded to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family. Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $5.1 billion, or 17%, in 2011 compared to 2010. Platform average selling prices and unit sales increased 8% and 7%, respectively. The increase in revenue was due to notebook platform unit sales and notebook platform average selling prices, which both increased 9%. To a lesser extent, an increase in desktop platform average selling prices of 6% and an increase in desktop platform unit sales of 4% also contributed to the increase. In addition to the extra work week in 2011, our client business benefited from rising incomes that increased the affordability of PCs in emerging markets. We also saw an increase in revenue as demand increased in the enterprise and emerging markets for higher performance and more energy-efficient computing. Operating income increased by $1.8 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 as the gross margin increase of $2.4 billion was partially offset by $584 million of higher operating expenses. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue partially offset by approximately $960 million of higher start-up costs as we transitioned into production using our 22nm process technology. Higher platform unit costs and inventory write-offs as compared to 2010 also contributed to the offset. 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: (In Millions) 2012 2011 2010 Net revenue $ 10,741 $ 10,129 $ 8,693 Operating income $ 5,073 $ 5,100 $ 4,388 Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $612 million, or 6%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase in revenue was due to 6% higher platform average selling prices, slightly offset by 1% lower platform volume. Our platform average selling prices benefited from a richer mix of products sold. In 2012, our server business continued to benefit from significant growth in the Internet cloud segment offset by weakness in the enterprise server market segment. Operating income decreased by $27 million in 2012 compared to 2011 as $360 million of higher gross margin was more than offset by $387 million of higher operating expenses. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue. Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in revenue was due to a 12% increase in platform unit sales. Our server business benefited from growth in the number of devices that compute and connect to the Internet, driving the build-out of the cloud infrastructure. Additionally, platform average selling prices increased 3% due to an increased demand for higher-performance computing. Operating income increased by $712 million in 2011 compared to 2010 as the gross margin increase of $1.2 billion was partially offset by $487 million of higher operating expenses. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the other Intel architecture operating segments, including the Intelligent Systems Group, Intel Mobile Communications, the Netbook Group, the Tablet Group, the Phone Group, and the Service Provider Group for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: (In Millions) 2012 2011 2010 Net revenue $ 4,378 $ 5,005 $ 3,055 Operating income (loss) $ (1,377 ) $ (577 ) $ 270 Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $627 million, or 13%, in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower IMC average selling prices and lower netbook platform volume. To a lesser extent, lower netbook platform average selling prices contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher ISG platform average selling prices. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $800 million from an operating loss of $577 million in 2011 to an operating loss of $1.4 billion in 2012. The decline in operating results was primarily due to lower netbook revenue and higher operating expenses in the Other IA operating segments. Additionally, lower IMC revenue was largely offset by lower IMC unit cost. Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments increased by $2.0 billion, or 64%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to IMC revenue, an operating segment formed from the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon in the first quarter of 2011. To a lesser extent, higher ISG platform unit sales also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by lower netbook platform unit sales. Operating results for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $847 million from an operating income of $270 million in 2010 to an operating loss of $577 million in 2011. The decline in operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses within each of the Other IA operating segments, partially offset by higher revenue. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Software and Services Operating Segments The revenue and operating income (loss) for the SSG operating segments, including McAfee, the Wind River Software Group, and the Software and Services Group, for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: (In Millions) 2012 2011 2010 Net revenue $ 2,381 $ 1,870 $ 264 Operating income (loss) $ (11 ) $ (32 ) $ (175 ) Net revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $511 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to two months of incremental revenue from McAfee of $469 million. McAfee was acquired on February 28, 2011. The operating loss for the SSG operating segments decreased by $21 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to higher McAfee revenue, partially offset by higher McAfee operating expenses. Net revenue for the SSG operating segments increased by $1.6 billion in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was due to revenue from McAfee, which was acquired on February 28, 2011. Due to the revaluation of McAfee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value at the time of acquisition, we excluded $204 million of revenue that would have been reported in 2011 if McAfee’s deferred revenue had not been written down due to the acquisition. The operating loss for the SSG operating segments decreased by $143 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses across each of the SSG operating segments. Due to the revaluation of McAfee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value at the time of acquisition, we excluded revenue and associated costs that would have increased operating results by $190 million in 2011. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: (Dollars In Millions) 2012 2011 2010 Research and development $ 10,148 $ 8,350 $ 6,576 Marketing, general and administrative $ 8,057 $ 7,670 $ 6,309 R&D and MG&A as percentage of net revenue 34 % 30 % 30 % Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles $ 308 $ 260 $ 18 Research and Development. R&D spending increased by $1.8 billion, or 22%, in 2012 compared to 2011, and increased by $1.8 billion, or 27%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was driven by increased investments in our products for smartphones, tablets, Ultrabook systems, and data centers. Additionally, R&D spending increased due to higher process development costs for our next-generation 14nm process technology, higher compensation expenses mainly due to annual salary increases, the full first quarter expenses of IMC and McAfee in 2012 (both acquired in the first quarter of 2011), and higher costs related to the development of 450mm wafer technology. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of McAfee and IMC, and to higher compensation expenses based on an increase in the number of employees. In addition, lower overall process development costs due to the transition to manufacturing start-up costs related to our 22nm process technology were mostly offset by higher process development costs due to R&D of our next-generation 14nm process technology. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by $387 million, or 5%, in 2012 compared to 2011, and increased by $1.4 billion, or 22%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the full first quarter expenses of McAfee in 2012 and higher compensation expenses mainly due to annual salary increases as well as an increase in the number of employees. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of McAfee and IMC, higher compensation expenses based on an increase in the number of employees, and higher advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses). Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles. The increase in 2012 compared to 2011 of $48 million was primarily due to the full year of amortization of intangibles in 2012 related to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon, both completed in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in 2011 compared to 2010 of $242 million was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of McAfee and the WLS business of Infineon in 2011. For further information, see “Note 13: Acquisitions” and “Note 16: Identified Intangible Assets” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion in 2012 ($1.1 billion in 2011 and $917 million in 2010). Share-based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 29, 2012, unrecognized share-based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: (Dollars in Millions) UnrecognizedShare-BasedCompensationCosts WeightedAveragePeriod Stock options $ 96 1.0 years Restricted stock units $ 1,523 1.3 years As of December 29, 2012, there was $13 million in unrecognized share-based compensation costs related to the rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan. We expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months. Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other Gains (losses) on equity investments, net and interest and other, net for the three years ended December 29, 2012 were as follows: (In Millions) 2012 2011 2010 Gains (losses) on equity investments, net $ 141 $ 112 $ 348 Interest and other, net $ 94 $ 192 $ 109 Net gains on equity investments were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower equity method losses and higher gains on third-party merger transactions, partially offset by lower gains on sales of equity investments. We recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments, higher equity method losses, and lower gains on third-party merger transactions. Net gains on equity investments for 2011 included a gain of $150 million on the sale of shares in VMware, Inc. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $181 million on the initial public offering of SMART Technologies, Inc. and the subsequent partial sale of our shares in the secondary offering. We also recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V., and a gain of $67 million on the sale of shares in Micron Technology, Inc. in 2010. Our share of equity method investee losses recognized in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC) ($145 million and $116 million, respectively). Our share of equity method investee losses recognized in 2011 reduced our carrying value in Clearwire LLC to zero. We do not expect to recognize additional equity method losses for Clearwire LLC in the future. Interest and other, net decreased in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a $164 million gain recognized upon formation of the Intel-GE Care Innovations, LLC (Care Innovations) joint venture during the first quarter of 2011 and higher interest expense in 2012. This decrease was partially offset by proceeds received from an insurance claim in the second quarter of 2012 related to the floods in Thailand. Interest and other, net increased in 2011 compared to 2010. The $164 million gain recognized upon formation of Care Innovations during 2011 was partially offset by the recognition of $41 million of interest expense in 2011 compared to zero in 2010 and lower interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of lower average investment balances. We recognized interest expense during 2011 as the amount of interest incurred began to exceed the amount we were able to capitalize upon the issuance of $5.0 billion aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2011. 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: (Dollars in Millions) 2012 2011 2010 Income before taxes $ 14,873 $ 17,781 $ 16,045 Provision for taxes $ 3,868 $ 4,839 $ 4,581 Effective tax rate 26.0 % 27.2 % 28.6 % We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2012 compared to 2011, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2012. This impact was partially offset by a U.S. research and development tax credit that was not reinstated in 2012. The U.S. research and development tax credit was reenacted in January 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. The full year 2012 impact of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit will be recognized in the first quarter 2013 financial statements and is expected to have a significant positive impact on the first quarter of 2013 effective tax rate. We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2011 compared to 2010, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources (Dollars in Millions) Dec. 29,2012 Dec. 31,2011 Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets $ 18,162 $ 14,837 Loans receivable and other long-term investments $ 1,472 $ 1,769 Short-term and long-term debt $ 13,448 $ 7,331 Debt as percentage of stockholders’ equity 26.3 % 16.0 % 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) In summary, our cash flows were as follows: (In Millions) 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 18,884 $ 20,963 $ 16,692 Net cash used for investing activities (14,060 ) (10,301 ) (10,539 ) Net cash used for financing activities (1,408 ) (11,100 ) (4,642 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents (3 ) 5 — Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,413 $ (433 ) $ 1,511 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2012 compared to 2011, the $2.1 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to lower net income and changes in our working capital, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2012 compared to 2011, partially offset by increases in non-acquisition-related deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 29, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 included higher inventories on the ramp of 3rd generation Intel® Core™ processor family products, partially offset by a significant reduction in older-generation products. For 2012, our three largest customers accounted for 43% of our net revenue (43% in 2011 and 46% in 2010), with Hewlett-Packard Company accounting for 18% of our net revenue (19% in 2011 and 21% in 2010), Dell accounting for 14% of our net revenue (15% in 2011 and 17% in 2010), and Lenovo accounting for 11% of our net revenue (9% in 2011 and 8% in 2010). These three customers accounted for 33% of our accounts receivable as of December 29, 2012 (36% as of December 31, 2011). For 2011 compared to 2010, the $4.3 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for non-cash items and higher net income. The adjustments for non-cash items were higher for 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization of intangibles, as well as increases in non-acquisition-related deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2011 compared to December 25, 2010. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2011 compared to 2010 were $1.3 billion lower, largely due to the tax benefit of depreciating 100% of assets placed in service in the U.S. in 2011. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; as well as cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in 2012, as compared to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments and trading assets in 2011, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions. Net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2012 included our purchase of $3.2 billion of equity securities in ASML during the third quarter of 2012. Our capital expenditures were $11.0 billion in 2012 ($10.8 billion in 2011 and $5.2 billion in 2010). Cash used for investing activities decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010. A decrease due to net maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments in 2011 as compared to net purchases of available-for-sale investments in 2010 was offset by higher cash paid for acquisitions, of which the substantial majority was for our acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011, and an increase in capital expenditures. The significant increase in capital expenditures in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to the expansion of our network of fabrication facilities to include an additional large-scale fabrication facility, as well as bringing our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity online. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2012, compared to 2011, was primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of a higher amount of long-term debt in 2012 compared to 2011. We have an ongoing authorization, since October 2005, as amended, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $45 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions. During 2012, we repurchased $4.8 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to $14.1 billion in 2011. As of December 29, 2012, $5.3 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $2.1 billion in 2012 compared to $2.0 billion in 2011. Our total dividend payments were $4.4 billion in 2012 compared to $4.1 billion in 2011 as a result of an increase in quarterly cash dividends per common share. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 81 quarters. In January 2013, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.225 per common share for the first quarter of 2013. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2013 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2013. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt in 2011 and higher proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. As of December 29, 2012, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled $18.2 billion ($14.8 billion as of December 31, 2011). In addition to the $18.2 billion, we have $1.5 billion in loans receivable and other long-term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in A/A2 or better rated issuances, and the majority of the issuances are rated AA-/Aa3 or better. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2012 were $500 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 29, 2012. Our commercial paper was rated A-1+ by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s as of December 29, 2012. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued $6.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. These notes were issued for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program. For further information on the terms of the notes, see “Note 19: Borrowings” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions, such as an obligor’s credit risk, that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see “Fair Value” in “Note 2: Accounting Policies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 29, 2012, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $15.3 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $5.2 billion was classified as Level 1, $10.0 billion as Level 2, and $126 million as Level 3. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active. Of the $10.0 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 60% was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model, and approximately 40% was classified as such due to the use of non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non-binding market consensus prices or the non-binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate our fair value measurements using non-binding market consensus prices and non-binding broker quotes from a second source. Loans Receivable and Reverse Repurchase Agreements As of December 29, 2012, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $780 million of loans receivable and $2.8 billion of reverse repurchase agreements. All of these investments were classified as Level 2, as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Marketable Equity Securities As of December 29, 2012, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $4.4 billion of marketable equity securities. All of these securities were classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 29, 2012: Payments Due by Period (In Millions) Total Less Than1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years MoreThan 5Years Operating lease obligations $ 909 $ 206 $ 315 $ 178 $ 210 Capital purchase obligations1 4,618 4,554 64 — — Other purchase obligations and commitments2 1,958 1,140 581 228 9 Long-term debt obligations3 22,852 480 860 5,330 16,182 Other long-term liabilities4, 5 1,714 627 652 330 105 Total6 $ 32,051 $ 7,007 $ 2,472 $ 6,066 $ 16,506 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2012, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. 2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services, as well as payments due under non-contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. 4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $177 million of long-term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long-term income taxes payable, recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non-U.S. income taxes. 5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Expected required contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $63 million to be made during 2013 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2013 are not practicable to estimate. 6 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services, included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table, include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table. These obligations include milestone-based co-marketing agreements, contingent funding/payment obligations, and milestone-based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. During 2012, we entered into a series of agreements with ASML intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and EUV lithography. Intel agreed to provide R&D funding totaling €829 million (approximately $1.1 billion as of December 29, 2012) over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from ASML. Our obligation is contingent upon ASML achieving certain milestones. As a result, we have not included this obligation in the preceding table. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. Contractual obligations with regard to our investment in IMFT are not included in the preceding table. We are currently committed to purchasing 49% of IMFT’s production output and production-related services. We also have several agreements with Micron related to the supply of NAND flash memory products, IP, and R&D funding related to non-volatile memory manufacturing. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFT’s inventory was approximately $28 million as of December 29, 2012. For further information, see “Note 10: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the table above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements As of December 29, 2012, we did not have any significant off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of the potential changes that follow are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non-U.S.-currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. For further information, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $80 million as of December 29, 2012 (less than $40 million as of December 31, 2011). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed-rate debt instruments with interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to interest rate loss. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness. Our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a long-term patent cross-license agreement with NVIDIA. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields, which generally track the U.S.-dollar three-month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 29, 2012 (an increase of approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2011). The significant increase from December 31, 2011 was primarily driven by the inclusion of $6.2 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2012. A hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $10 million as of December 29, 2012 (an increase of approximately $20 million as of December 31, 2011). The fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see “Note 4: Fair Value” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Equity Prices Our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. We typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities. However, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. Additionally, for our securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal, and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the losses and gains on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. 41 Table of Contents As of December 29, 2012, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $4.4 billion ($585 million as of December 31, 2011). Our marketable equity investment in ASML was carried at a total fair market value of $4.0 billion, or 90% of our marketable equity portfolio, as of December 29, 2012. Our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we have analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 35% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $1.6 billion, based on the value as of December 29, 2012 (a decrease in value of approximately $265 million, based on the value as of December 31, 2011 using an assumed loss of 45%). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non-marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non-marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $1.2 billion as of December 29, 2012 ($1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011). As of December 29, 2012, the carrying amount of our non-marketable equity method investments was $1.0 billion ($1.6 billion as of December 31, 2011). The majority of the total non-marketable equity method investments balance as of December 29, 2012 was concentrated in our IMFT investment of $642 million ($1.3 billion in IMFT and IM Flash Singapore, LLP as of December 31, 2011). 42 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:52:50.144511
